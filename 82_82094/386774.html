			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Su Ge was lying in bed and was relieved of illness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Vanas quickly arranged things one by one according to Su Ge’s instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All core personnel are unified, and then Randall, Hills, Viginia and others are temporarily away from the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next night, Su Ge took out the enchantment of Emilia according to plan, and with the injection of psionics, he will be himself for these days. Things have been said a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he said is true content, including the Werewolf Plague, including the Moon Beast, including the Great God of Death, including the Son of the Great God. Of course, to solve all this, from myself to Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also said about his situation, first said that he was seriously injured, and then said that his priest’s career has changed in this battle, and many new The knowledge is advanced to the expert level. Finally, he said that he had used his life to persuade Vanas to return to the Holy See and gained her trust. He needed Emilia to personally negotiate in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sending of the demon, Bain City, Emilia, who was sitting at the desk reading, finally received the message of the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the demon, listen to the logic of Su Ge, clear regulations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more I listened to her, the more excited she was, the more she listened to her, the more she excited, and finally she stood up from her chair and shone with her eyes: "Sug, dry Be beautiful! Recover the kingdom of Guinness, remove the hidden dangers of the great god of death, the public becomes a rational werewolf... Su Ge, have to say that you are so smart, actually know some of my thoughts from the last conversation, It seems that Gerlos really didn't look at the wrong person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, she couldn't even wait, and immediately walked out of the room: "Notify the escort, start the small aircraft and start immediately." The target is the city of Guinness, which belongs to the studio."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Archbishop, there..." The strong female guard was hesitant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug has already solved it there, go!" Emilia was very anxious at this time, and she was very popular and prosperous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to bring other bishops?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, bring the guards, This action should be kept confidential."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Archbishop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three in the morning, Sue The grid woke up again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this time it’s not natural to wake up, but someone wakes him up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just opened his eyes, Sugton found at least seven or eight fully armed people in the ward, looking at himself indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge was very calm, and turned slightly to look at Emilia, sitting next to the bed, greeted: "For many days, you still look like a moon." The moonlight of the goddess is generally pure and beautiful. Archbishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia softly smiles: "Thank you for your compliments. But for many days, your changes are indeed not Small."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger said with a wry smile: "My change is exchanged for life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Emilia reached out and touched it on Su Ge's body twice. His face flashed a burst of praise and amazed: "Suge, your dedication, your loyalty can be rewarded in the near future." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your approval." Su Ge looks positive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Emilia let everyone go out and stay alone next to Su Ge and ask: "Talk to me about the details."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge used a one-and-a-half-hour period to tell the recent situation in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emeria looked at the large, scary tattoos on Su Ge’s body, and the eyes were brilliant, just like the little girl who saw the peerless handsome guy: That is to say, the curse of the werewolf has replaced the curse of the Great God. It has become the hometown of the werewolf, and most of the things of the Great God have been transferred to Vanas, making her a death witch, and a small part has come to you. , have these variations?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded. "You know, I have some talents to hear the soul. I was seriously injured and unable to fight. I was unable to fight. I heard a lot of whispers and mourning from the soul. I can't bear to clean them." During the purification, I heard the sound of the bells. When I got back to God, these tattoos appeared, and my profession of the gods changed and I got some knowledge about the bells."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s the clock in the valley of the Hades." Emilia said directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Hades of the Valley!?" Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia did not directly say, calm down the spirit and appease: "This is still not known in your current situation, but don't worry. When this one After the event, I will directly promote you as my bishop. After the official promotion, I will give you this and many of the core knowledge of the church! You can also help you on this path. Going more steadily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this Su Ge, I said with pleasure: "Thank you, Archbishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you look at Su Ge, the more satisfied you are: "There is more work for you. This is what you deserve. Help me to settle this matter. You are the regional bishop here. I will stay here. Months of time teach you one-on-one, and use my greatest resources to build a Cathedral of the Holy Blood within three months."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge heard a jump in his heart, he did not expect that all this came so fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, any need for a certain amount of effort, you understand?" Emilia asked faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded in a positive color: "Of course, from now on, I will be the loyal follower and partner of Archbishop Emilia, I Will contribute all my strength to the Archbishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Su Ge doing this, Emilia is even more happy: "You take a break, I will see you. When I saw the death witch, since the misunderstanding has been solved, then she should not be hostile to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the Archbishop, she is a witch, after all, You...to control your men." Su Ge hurriedly reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia stood up calmly: "Don't compare me to those who have no feelings, you can't understand the secrets. I can tell you in advance, the church and the witch, not We are not seeing the witches will be hunted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I heard this, Sugerton sensed a lot of information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes! Please be careful, she is not an ordinary witch now, don't anger her." Su Ge seriously cautioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia nodded slightly and left the ward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Emilia, Su Ge is relatively reassured, so close his eyes and continue to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Su Ge felt that the bones of the whole body suddenly recovered a lot, at least not hurting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price is that he has four more needles behind his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The blood therapy of the Church of the Holy Blood is amazing. These four needles will speed up your recovery." Mill is amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was on the sidelines when he was in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge did it, pinched his fist, and suddenly felt a lot stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, your Majesty and the Archbishop are chatting in the conference room, and you will wake up and let you go." Mill said a wave, two maids striding Come over and start to change clothes for Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, put Sugg in a wheelchair and push it to the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are no problems with the two of them?" Su Ge asked.米尔 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 Something about this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this Su Ge thought for a moment, "Well, this is the best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge was promoted to the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the elegant and refined living room, on the soft sofa, Vanas and Emilia are sitting opposite each other, and they are happy to talk about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no other people in the room, it looks like two girlfriends with nothing to talk about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge was pushed forward, both stopped at the same time to look at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can regain this so good, my warrior!" Vanas, wearing a white turtleneck lace dress, stood up happily, facing Su Ge Come along. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's subtle ceremony: "I have seen you! I have seen the Archbishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside Milia looked at Vanas's attitude towards Su Ge, and she flashed a glimmer of light in her eyes and said, "Your Majesty, I feel gratified and sincerely happy for Su Ge."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next person retired, Vanas personally pushed Su Ge to sit next to the coffee table, leaning on the back of the chair, and said with a smile: "The Archbishop, let’s talk about business. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia also said with a positive face: "This is what it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Although the misunderstanding has been lifted, the people have formed a habit. And in recent years, the corruption and infighting of the Church of the Holy Blood is very clear, so even if we are included in the jurisdiction of the Church of the Holy Blood, we must have absolute autonomy. Your church has no right to interfere in any internal affairs and laws of our country. Of course, we will also fulfill our obligations to help the church keep the northeast gate of the entire empire. And help you monitor the movements of many countries and strengths in the northeast of the mainland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia nodded slightly: "There is no problem with autonomy, but as a church of the Holy Blood The sign, we ask to build the Cathedral of the Holy Blood in the capital, and the bishop is appointed to manage it. At the same time, our people can freely preach here, and involves hunting, when you are encircling, you must unconditionally cooperate with us." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two seem to be very clear about each other's bottom line and tone, the asking price is very accurate, and there is no counter-offer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
