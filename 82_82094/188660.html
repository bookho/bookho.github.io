			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the warm and hearty dinner, the two men prayed for an hour in the custom of the goddess of the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is restored to the usual way after prayer. Of course, as a devout believer, Ida does not like Su Ge’s leisure, but intends to complete a prayer through prayer. The vigil of the goddess of the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comfortable lying in bed, Su Ge did not think much about entering the dream,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The eyes are, he is already sitting on the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a problem with the ghoul, and the ghouls will never reveal their form easily, let alone take the initiative to attack the church." Just now, he rushed to attack me and slammed back, indicating that his purpose was not to attack me, but to intentionally show his existence, that is, he wanted to pay attention to my attention. "Attracting this aspect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In conjunction with the current situation, then this event is only the beginning, the cold-hearted church is just a shield for the black man. And their real purpose and plan must have been implemented in other aspects!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge suddenly became cheerful, and finally caught this thing in his heart. Weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After waiting for Macock to recover, ask about his situation!" Su Ge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seeing my Lord!" Chuck’s voice came from the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his head and asked: "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The servant is from a dream The inspection came back and reported to you about the situation of the people." Chuck respectfully said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These days Suge did not summon Randall to the battleship, but to check the situation of four people through Chuck as the messenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuck with some of the power of Su Ge can easily and easily travel to and from the dreams of four people along each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuck replied: "Randall’s situation is not very good. His family is very opposed to his motion and is now in a deadlock. Hills is in good shape and has become a mysterious mercenary in the night scene. He has experienced three mysterious battles and has improved significantly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adeline has Converging with Jeros, but very little because of identity issues. She has led Bernice to the middle-class aristocratic circle of the Imperial Capital. Recently, the situation in the capital is relatively turbulent, the old king is old and weak, and the emperor is seriously fighting. On the other side, the border The infighting of the Guinness Principality has become more serious. I heard that a large number of undead and werewolves have caused a lot of power. Many cult organizations are ready to use it as a springboard to penetrate into the empire."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "What else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuck hesitated, then the temptation asked: "My Lord, you need Expedition? The undead has risen and formed a banner, the bones of the people. Accumulate in the altar, war and death have been staggered as the throne, waiting for your luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge is not here at this time, Feel free to say: "The time has not arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuck nodded and respectfully retired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" Pamela whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuck shook his head: "My Lord’s thinking is not something that I can fool with."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Pamela followed and nodded, turning to look at the outside of the battleship and said: "There can only be said that they are not enough to be worthy of their arms."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This side, due to brain capacity problems, Su Ge did not think too much and fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Su Ge continued to take morning exercises with his second husband, and returned to the church after breakfast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He attaches great importance to the situation of Macock and the aftermath of the corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge first came to the church, he just saw Father Harden, who was partnering with Father Anthony, rushing away from afar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, Father Harden, what happened?" Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Harden is full of black bearded face with a dignified weight: "You are coming, just go with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" Su Ge had some bad feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Macock, who brought you yesterday, suddenly committed suicide after waking up at four o'clock in the morning." Father Harden whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!?" He widened his eyes when he heard this Suggton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morgue of the Church Medical District, several people surround the horse The body that Cork has completely died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them are Su Ge, Father Harden, a middle-aged man in a white robe, Father Hank, and finally Roland, whose face is pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened!" Roland shivered and the spirit had collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked down at Markoc’s body and saw that he was really dying. He used the glass fragments of the infusion bottle to cut his throat very cruelly, with three wounds on his neck, and the blood had been disposed of, revealing a pale skin cross section. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the bishop know this?" The middle-aged man in the white robe asked in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the captain of the Bain Regional Officer, called Gael Mauser, an expert-level priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five days ago, he led the gods’ delegation from the capital to participate in the selection of the sacred choir and began normal work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Hank said: "Bishop Ron was seriously injured when he last fought with the vampire, and he has not recovered yet. The deputy bishop is dealing with the aftermath in the clinic. Matters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to him?" Gael asked in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Hank explained: "He was very hurt when he came yesterday. I have normal blood treatment for him. I have been comatose because of the trauma of my spirit." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the early hours of the morning, he suddenly woke up and broke the infusion bottle. He madly removed the guarded nun and then locked the door. He said that he was guilty, damn it. Sorry, my father and I have some words. When I bring someone to the door, he has already fallen into a pool of blood. After an hour of rescue, he died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When I heard this, everyone was lost in thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one doubts that this is killing him, because here is the Church of the Holy Blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the mysterious influence not yet completely finished?" Su Ge thought of a possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Hank shook his head: "We have thoroughly cleaned and expelled before treatment, and it is quite certain that there is no mysterious element in his body." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, Roland walked over and looked down at Macock’s body and trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silent tears, she slowly squats and gently hugs the cold body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug gently lifted her shoulders and said in a random manner: "I want to pray for him and ask about his soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing this, the Gail priest on the side replied indifferently: "I hope you don't tarnish the soul of this people."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly and didn’t say much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Gail’s three priests have seen several times, but for some reason, these three have a big prejudice against themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some of these reasons, naturally, when they left, Su Ge’s heroic performance and superiority to their priesthood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
