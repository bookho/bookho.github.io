			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nell's mouth, suddenly made Emilia a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is also very experienced and generally knows what kind of person this guy is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The self-sustaining is very high, self-righteous, born with a noble mind and unwillingness to be grounded, and the emotional intelligence is extremely low. It is similar to those of ancient ruins."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia seems to know his character and opens the subject and says, "I heard that you just finished dealing with a witch's runaway?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "Well, I want to go back and look at it when I pass by, and then accidentally hit it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say it!” Then a group of four people walked in from the left ear of the church and went to the second floor of the church through the surrounding stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg simply said what happened before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia’s face was a little dignified and said: “Sure enough, something happened.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Do you have any clues?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emilia shook her head: "Because it is still unclear. But in the last two months, the church has been in the jurisdiction for fifteen times. The witch’s violent affair, on average, is one day. This is far beyond the sum of the past five years.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this Suge look suddenly, then in my mind Quickly recall the violent situation of the witch who just walked on the street and suddenly there was a sudden change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All the witches are violent without any external stimuli!?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emilia silenced and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sud, Su Ge was heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nile on the side said loudly at this time: "The group of witches is just a group of scourges. We should kill them completely in order to eliminate the aftermath. The so-called control However, it is a temporary method of temporary stability, learning... the Archbishop, we must change the views and countermeasures for the witch. These days of events clearly prove that the past research and theory are wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia said faintly: "I have said it many times, don't make it too arbitrary, do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nell also wants to refute, but I was stunned by Emilia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge brows slightly wrinkled, turned to look at Griffin with a hint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin’s eyes flashed with helplessness, and snorted and gestured for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came to a living room on the second floor, four people sat down. Su Ge will report on his own situation over the past six months and know for himself. The information of the two new Yi people, the human face rat and the moon beast was revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Emilia already knows from Griffin’s mouth, she hears that Sug is very candid to say everything, her heart Suddenly put it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, you are doing very well, Su Ge. Especially the intelligence of these two new Yi people is very important to the church." Emily Ya looked up and praised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nealton was dissatisfied and said: "The Archbishop, isn’t this all regular work? Collecting new Yi people is a part of the work of the church staff. Is there anything worthy of praise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of approval, he has never had it in the past three months. Now he is actually a half-way monk, has not experienced any high-level training, even graduated from an ordinary university, rather than a grass-roots graduated from a higher university, which makes him feel very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owned by Star Tianting, even higher than the starting point of the hymn, is the top genius closest to the goddess! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, his heart is more uncomfortable, like a child who has not been praised by the teacher, full of resentment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emilia looked at him and said: "The witch's widow should have been sent back, you have handled it in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This kind of thing makes those people..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go!" Emilia's voice was harsh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Nel’s face was pale and immediately got up and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Nell left, Su Ge asked with a hint of incomprehensibility: "The Archbishop, how can you put such an emotional intelligence into a negative number? Such a critical position? Now is the key period of Bain City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emilia was a little tired and did not speak, alongside Griffin explained: "Bishop, do you really think that the Archdiocese made such a decision?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge a glimpse, then looked at Emilia: "Is it... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I told you before that there are many old guys in the Holy See who are very disrespectful and have the opportunity to insert a nail into my foundation. They are very happy," Emilia opened her eyes and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's face is a bit weird: "The brother's emotional intelligence, this life should not be a "nail"."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because it is so troublesome. The status of Star Heaven is super special. The ones that come out from inside are very assertive and self-sustaining. The most important thing is that they do not belong to any forces. They have their own set. A unique idea. Those old guys can't control him, and I can't control it. He appears to interfere with my layout in Bain City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this In combination with the words of Nerna, Su Ge nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is now like a younger brother who I am learning to learn to be stupid. Because of the relationship, I can't hurt him, and I can't be too harsh. And he doesn't know how to be a good person. I was very anxious to express my attitude."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she looked up at Su Ge: "So I am calling you back this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you need me to do?" Su Ge asked calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia turned her head and looked out the window, leaving Su Ge with a pure, full-faced side face: "I am going to the Holy See, I am After he left, he will definitely take out his own system that he thinks is very good, completely disturbing the situation here. Guinness is not far from here, I need you to take care of it when necessary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge listened to the brow micro-lock: "What is your care?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia's face gradually cooled down: "If something big happens The problem, you need to lead your people to control this place for the first time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge took a deep breath and nodded and said, "You can rest assured, This is no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin had some surprises after listening, he did not expect Su Ge to be so happy, confidently promised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Su Ge asked: "What do you plan to do at this stage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "There should be no change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge understood the next plan of Emilia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Next, you will spend more time here. I always feel that something is staring at us. Nell is a self-righteous idiot, this I can only rely on you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened to Shen Shendao: "The problem is not big, but I need some permission here."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The group of people you used to have now been placed under your jurisdiction, and now you are handing over and relocating, you have the right to order them." Emilia Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug immediately laughed: "Then I will be fine. You can rest assured that Bain City is my hometown, even without your order, I will Try to protect it here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emeria nodded: "You are kind, good-natured, mature enough and steady, I am relieved that you are doing things." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your approval, Archbishop." Su Ge bowed his head slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For Nell, you don't need to be too tolerant, let him hit the wall many times and estimate that he will mature earlier. Although he is not my person, as a master The level of the priest is indeed a talent that is not much in the church. Even if he can't use it for me, he can make enough contributions to the church, and I am happy to see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Upon hearing this, Su Ge couldn't help but look at Emilia. He couldn't hear whether Emilia was lying, but if it was true, then Sog had to look at Emilia's mind-and-heart pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, the Queen and his chief of staff haven’t changed anything recently?" Emilia asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug shook his head: "I didn't have it when I came. Now two people believe in me very much. If something happens, I won't glare at me." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good, hope is only a partial problem, and does not affect all witches." Emilia relaxed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the time, two people chatted about some other aspects of the piecemeal problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, Emilia said: "The room is ready, just in the west side of the worship suite, you can go directly to the rest, you can go Look for your former friend, the future of the subordinates to tell the old."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looks easy to stand up: "Thank you for your understanding, then you rest first, I will retire first "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Su Ge left the room alone, and Emilia seemed to have something to talk to Griffin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking in a church-style corridor, Suge looked at the window on the side with ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area inside the Basilica of the Holy Blood can be seen through the window on the left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The layout seems to be more complicated than before." Su Ge thought as he walked down the stairs, and he couldn't see Luobo for half a year. He couldn't wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You just walked downstairs and just saw Nell standing at the door of the ear and waiting for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he saw Su Ge coming down, Nell’s face was a bit gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a simple little guy who can’t control his emotions when he sits in the position of the bishop.” Su Ge’s mouth showed a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
