			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hours later, when the big bottle of blood was about to enter, Father Hank walked in with two white nuns dressed in white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge has completely adjusted his mind at this moment and smiled and said: "You are really on time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Hank looked at the bottle and said freely: "I have been doing this for years, I am familiar with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Hank came over Picking up the bed around, ask: "How do you feel now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, the whole body is moderate, very comfortable, full of strength." Su Ge Pinch the palm and say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hank nodded and reached for a touch on Su Ge’s neck and chest, then said: “The absorption is very good, it’s not enhanced by the lion’s blood. The body is already out of the ordinary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Father Hank has some incomprehensible questions: "What is the injury to your chest? The wound is just on the edge of the heart. A little carelessness will hurt the heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wound was stabbed by the madman of the Green Flame Brotherhood. Although it has been fixed, it is still very obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug heard a heartbeat and then sighed: "I have a dog at home, the dog is a little too lively. Once I cooked in the kitchen. When I fell, it thought that I was wrong. When I rushed over, the knives on the side slipped down. Fortunately, I was wearing more clothes, only piercing some flesh and not hurting inside."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the two nuns on the side are all weird, what kind of dog can be like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is very shameless to push all the responsibilities to Erha and said: "The dog is a standard two goods. You will know when you see it later. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hanke sat down at this time and pulled the needle down. He used a white alcohol cotton to hold the needle and said: "You are not wearing thick, but luck." Ok."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Geen gave a cry, then asked without a trace: "Right, I checked my body in a coma, did you find any diseases or hidden diseases?"<br /><br />&nbsp; Hank listened and shook his head and said, "No, although your body was weak, but the overall situation is not bad. Also, your chest seems to have a long bone, the bone is a kind of bone. The weird way to protect your heart. This is a kind of congenital malformation, but it should be regarded as a good variation. It is similar to some people who have six fingers, which does not affect your future life. You don't have to care too much. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the bone that blocks the knife and only pierces the flesh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge heard this heart secretly sighed: "The original luck is good to say this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ice heart is in I don't know what it is like in my body. Although I don't know how they checked, Hank God It seems that the ice around the heart has been made into bones. Anyway, it is ok without revealing the stuffing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thinking in Su Ge’s heart, the nuns on the side Put Suge's clothes, hat and cane on the table beside the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to digest this energy, you can't continue to lie in bed next time. Otherwise, you can easily get dizzy and disgusted because of the thick blood." Hank Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge naturally knows what it means, pinching his fist and saying, "Exactly, I am lying enough."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Su Ge’s body has basically recovered, put on his clothes, picked up his cane, and felt a lot of peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just stood up and took a step, and Sug almost didn’t fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the cane in hand finally played a role in matching his name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the inspiration of Father Hank, the two nuns who care about the face did not help Su Ge, but let him slowly find the rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After absorbing the lessons here, Suge carefully opened his legs and gradually found the feeling after a few steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call! It’s a long-lost feeling! Father, how long have I been lying?” Su Ge felt refreshed at the moment, although the body still Some are stiff, but there is a kind of comfort that can't be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hank calculated that "it has been three days, seventy-three hours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suge stepped on the smooth ground and twisted to the door and asked, "Can I go out to the sun?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, but you need to Wear a coat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hank takes great care of Su Ge, Fifteen minutes later, Su Ge, wearing a heavy coat, walked out of the ward along the long corridor with a cane and saw a white world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be just after the snow, the sun is shining, with the white snow on the ground, the extra light of the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took a cold chill, took his cane down the steps, and looked up to enjoy the sun in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you can walk normally, you can go straight to your home and go home." Hank came over and reminded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your care." Sug turned his head and said with gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hank smiled and waved his hand: "I just have time today, are you interested in visiting your future work unit?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard this very happy smile and said: "Happy to the moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people walked side by side just after Clean up the neat stone road, the two nuns did not come over, they still have their work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge walked and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
