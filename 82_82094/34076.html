			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at that small bottle of the lion's potion, Sug squinted: "Who would dare to use it!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeros put away the bottle: "On one side, it is used by the demon hunter, and there are some situations in which other professions can also be used, such as swordsmen, such as boxers, such as the Lancers. These occupations have Very strong anti-toxicity, and control of the body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said after listening: "As long as there is a way to resist the toxins, everyone You can use potions, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be understood, but this is not realistic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suge did not say much, unscrew the cork, and an unpleasant smell came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't smell, drink it." Gerlos reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is holding his breath and drinking the potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potion tastes very bad, some like musk scent, drinking all the throat is hot, and the potion has a burning sensation, Su Ge I feel that drinking is not a potion, it is a flame! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s okay, that kind of pain is not intense, and Sug’s stomach sticks for about a minute and starts to feel dizzy and his own The gradual blurring of thinking and spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is incomparably awkward, and there are countless strange whispers and whispers around the quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump, Su Ge seems to drink too much, lying on the ground, looking at the ceiling with both eyes blurred, hands clasped forward, do not know what to hold . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He seems to see something," Warren said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss said faintly: "His affinity for mystery is very good. If you have a firm heart, there will be a good future."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you really intend to bring him into the scepter? Our relationship and they don't seem to be good." Warren heard the conversation between the two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss raised his leg and said: "The sacred officer has a great advantage in entering the sinner. It is most appropriate to enter the sinner. We can't stop it. Su Ge is the kind of person who is very affectionate, so we push the boat, so that we There is an acquaintance inside the sinner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warren listened to the thumbs up and said, "Great, teacher."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge on the ground feels that he has seen a lot of things that he has never seen before, there is light, there is fog, and there is something that is distorted and does not know what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are on their side, he reaches out and grabs, but finds that he can’t catch it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gradual retreat of the drug, the realization of Su Ge's eyes returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whispers in the ear are still going on, and even some more fine winds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you hear the whispers and beliefs of those souls now?" Gerlos asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug was a little sluggish and nodded. He felt very bad at this time, his mind was blocked, his body was sore, and he couldn’t tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go back to drink more hot water, go to the toilet more, and tomorrow, the toxins will be almost cleaned up, Warren, send him back."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Su Ge was stunned by Warren’s help. Go home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sug was sent back, Warren did not enter the house, leaving Su Ge at the door and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his habit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunting devils are cold-blooded killers, they are contaminated with bad luck, rushing into other people's homes, will bring bad luck to others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are already riddled with bad luck, there is no need to bring bad things to others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuzzling in the bed, Su Ge fell asleep and came to the ice warship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting on the throne, Su Ge thought about what he saw and heard today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The effect of the potion is really weird." Su Ge thought, looking at his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, through the eyes of the gods, he saw some red silk inside the body, these wires are illusory, connected to a certain position in the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These are the power of the contract. Although it feels like you can cut off these contracts at any time, it is a very dead behavior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger now needs to grow and develop under the protection of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, he saw his body full of purple psionics, and the body has undergone some changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a structural change, but in his brain, in the body, there are some purple blood vessels in the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This should be the transformation of the potion on the body, the smoother running of the psionic power, and increase the perception." Su Ge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to lack of information, Su Ge could not get deeper intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the brain used the gods cpu to process the information of the 82 occupations, and then quit the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you open your eyes, time has come to the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling at this time was already a lot more comfortable, and then Su Ge felt that his body had a permanent strengthening, and his physical quality changed from a waste house to a Normal adult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the span is small, Su Ge is also very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咕噜噜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the scream of the stomach, a tingling pain in the abdomen makes Su The grid was almost called out, and then went crazy to the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next afternoon, Su Ge was drinking water and spending time in the toilet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the gradual elimination of toxins, Su Ge feels more and more comfortable, and his heart gradually changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very calm, the first thing that comes to mind when you encounter something is the gods or miracles, there is always the urge to pray, and always thinking about purifying those filthy believers. Let them worship the March goddess more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the effect of the sacred potion? So quickly, my daily behavior, even the mental structure and impulsiveness, has completely changed." Su Ge’s heart Amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this change, Su Ge is very resistant, because he does not want to be a god of open mouth, shut up the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking for a moment, he entered his dream again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the eyes of the gods, Su Ge quickly resolved the effect of the potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The effect is divided into four aspects, the first is to strengthen the body. The second is to increase the body's psionic blood vessels. The third is to change the facial temperament. The fourth is to change the mental structure and habits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The four effects are controlled by four different and independent structures. The first three are not used. Move and correct the mental structure and habits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge can clear the contractual constraints at any time, and it is more important to understand the part of the potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pick up mysterious spears at once, and the spears and spears condense in the cold, forming a faint ice needle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This imaginary long needle easily penetrates through the flesh and penetrates into the large purple blood vessel that reaches the back of the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sugg suddenly heard the sound of ice breaking, then he saw that a large purple blood vessel gradually turned into purple light particles, blended in Other parts of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time should be almost the same." Su Ge thought of going back to reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
