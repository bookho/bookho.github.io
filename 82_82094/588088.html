			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second floor lounge of the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, the body of the slightly fat young man was lying on the bed, standing around five people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug, Sherry, Captain Macock, Captain Marqui, and a young man with brown hair and gold-rimmed glasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young man is called Ban Bray, a mysterious advisor to Captain Macock, an expert mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, he discovered the mysterious traces of Su Ge’s stay in the bald youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This person is full of mysterious fluctuations, just like being immersed and strengthened by some kind of mysterious agent." The class said with a shocked look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock shook his head: "This is impossible. We have conducted a very rigorous search. It is impossible to have such a large-scale mysterious ceremony and materials." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Marko asked Su Ge: "What do you think of Mr. Assassin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "He was parasitized," Su Ge said casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Parasitic?" Hearing the word, Macock gave a glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class was also very surprised: "How did you see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen Sugi said, looking down at the youth's body and saying: "His spirit has been hypnotized, opening his brain to the body, and then keeping it in a state of mental hypnosis through a little thing," <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Open the brain's bondage to the body? What does this mean?" asked the class with a puzzled look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly explained: "The human body has a lot of potential. If people can really explode their full potential, the whole physical fitness will become very scary. "Marcok nodded. He has been in the army for many years. He has seen many soldiers experiencing the power of terror in the desperate situation. He lifted a carriage or a big stone. He Have seen it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge continued: "Although there is great potential, there is a limit to the human body. Our bones, our muscles are unable to withstand the long-running load, and those who have the potential to explode are generally weak. Time, even when the bones were broken and there were many people with broken tendons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock continued to nod, and he had seen many of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The human brain is very aware of the limits of human form, so instinct it will give the body a lot of restrictions, allowing the body to be in a relatively safe range. In the middle of the event."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge tears open the clothes of the young arm, can see the white blood of the youth is full of blood red blood beads, even large The area of ​​the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if consciousness has fainted, the arm is instinctively shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this restriction can be opened by psychological cues to gain a powerful force far beyond normal. But the cost is also very serious," said Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is... the formation of muscle tissue breaks and dissolves, and it is very serious." Markoc recognizes this phenomenon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation often occurs in the military's high-strength training, but it is far less serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly said: "I just gave a simple examination of his body, his synovial membrane was dry, his tendon was broken, and the bones of his limbs appeared. A lot of cracks are like a porcelain that is full of cracks and broken at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the end of the rush to break through the limits of humanity."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, the three people suddenly feel that the worldview has been refreshed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People often say that if they try to break through their limits, they can reach a whole new world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that it is indeed a new world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a disability, or death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For normal people, both are new worlds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you know that he is parasitized?" Marchi asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug raised his hand on his chest and said, "I just said, I checked him for the body."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you find?" asked the class curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s casual smile: “Found a cute little octopus.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finished, Su Ge’s palm patted the young man’s chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden burst of subtle sound waves passed through Su Ge’s hand to the youth’s body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone’s gaze, the throat of the youth began to creep slowly, as if something had to climb out from there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, this thing began to crawl down the throat to his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the mouth of the young man was gradually stuffed with something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of opening his mouth, a shadow directly rushes out of the youth's mouth and flies to Marki standing on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key moment Su Ge instantly reached out and grabbed the shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My God, what a ghost thing!" When Makok saw this thing, his eyes were slightly enlarged, and then the vision suddenly grew a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a slap-sized black octopus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this octopus is much more than a normal octopus. Its tentacle is not only a sucker, but also a lot of teeth-like things. The big mouth is wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The activity of this thing is very large. At this time, Su Ge’s hands are constantly struggling, and the bite of the black gloves against Su Ge cannot be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side of Malki's pale back two steps, the voice trembled and said: "How did this come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class leaned over and looked carefully After watching it, he whispered: "This should be a magical object summoned by the ritual, and it has a strong hiddenness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge holds this thing After a few more, I said, "I will study this thing first. You should call the ship doctor soon, otherwise the gentleman will die on your ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When I heard this, Macock suddenly changed his mind and said in a hurry: "Call the ship doctor to come over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s pinch, the inside of the palm of the hand flashed However, this octopus was suddenly frozen and motionless, just like dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Marki looked paler and looked quite frightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be afraid, I am professional." Su Ge said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock comforts: "Yes, Mr. Assassin is very professional, don't be afraid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Markie nodded slightly, she had never seen these things before, and the hand could not control the trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people walked out of the cabin, just to see the heroine sent by the security captain, Miss Mary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary looked at the two people who came over and didn’t have a hand, but they were very polite and said: "Thank you again for your brave help. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "This is okay, Miss Mary doesn't have to care too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mary smiled slightly: "I have to go back to the troupe to report a peace, can't express more gratitude to you. If you have time, wait until the glory city, I will invite you two best. Play around, this world-famous great city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes lit up: "Okay! For the glory city has been long time, if If you lead the way, our honeymoon trip will be very smooth and enjoyable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am honored." Mary heard a trace of suspiciousness in her eyes after hearing the honeymoon trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaving the wrong shoulder, Shirley asked faintly: "Do you have sex with it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Sogra lived her hand and asked seriously: "After seeing your perfect body, will I have sex with women other than you?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Shirley very happy, and nodded slightly: "We have Bernice, you are doing more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She Very clever, but often I don't want to think about issues that she thinks are boring and low-level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug easily said: "I don't want to expose Bernice, we just secretly contact. I can feel that there is a bureau in Huiyao City. Waiting for me, I need a good entry point. This actress is perfect. She can reach people at all levels of the Imperial City, and there must be a lot of troubles and troubles. After this, she has been infected. The cause and effect of this, the whole thing has not ended, she will be subject to other mysterious attacks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You really are not afraid of the Church of the Holy Blood to catch you? The city is not Bain City.” Shirley was a bit curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this trip to Hui Yao City, Su Ge’s self-confidence seems to be too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge has a well-thought-out smile, explaining: "Adeline has paved the way there, and Jerous is also in the capital, where I know very well. Only a handful of high-level people have seen my portrait, and the rest of the people only know my name. With the effect of the Holy Grail of the Soul and the help of Adeline, I can say that there is more than enough."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you were discovered?" Xuelier asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said with a smile: "Then I have other options."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The secret, now you can't say it." Su Ge is hard to sell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
