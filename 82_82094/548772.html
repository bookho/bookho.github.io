			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not expect any useful information from Ada. I can see that Ada has given him peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today's knee pillow, so intimate kneading and fiddle, even let Su Ge feel that he has come to the peak of life, there is no desire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is one thing you need to pay attention to." Just as Sue comfortably floated in the clouds, Ada's nice voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug hurried back to God and opened his eyes to look at Ada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Human, no matter what human beings can't touch the Holy Grail." Ada said very directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg heard this suddenly: "Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aidana dark There is a deep indifference in the eyelids: "Because humans are not qualified."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge silences: "Any human being will not do it? That kind of lord , Dominator, even the Great Sage?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada’s plain answer: “No one except the great god can touch the Holy Grail.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge’s heart suddenly sinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can’t get in touch, how do you take the Holy Grail? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada did not say much, let this peaceful time pass slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not think much, this is a rare good time, he does not want to waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lying on Ada’s lap, feeling the pinch of Aida’s finger on his earlobe, Su Ge’s comfortable eyes closed, and the fine taste is wonderful. a feeling of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge returned to the eyes of God, he found that he had already It was the next morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am not in Ada's legs, but sitting in the cave to meditate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only felt for a moment, it seems that the last second is still beside Ada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, the situation is not very good." Randall suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge suddenly stood up and asked, "What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hills, Sonic The three people were very languid, saying that they heard a horrible whisper in their ear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened to the body and rushed out, just to see three The individual was pale at this time, and his eyes were afraid of relying on the wall, and his appearance was very miserable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thick bell rang, and the night clock of the soul reverberated throughout the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bell heard, the faces of the three people gradually recovered, and the fear in the eyes gradually dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge asks: "When did you start?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working with three people Jenny said: "At about seven o'clock in the morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What other abnormalities?" Sug turned to ask Randall, who was in charge of the alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall thought about it, his eyes flashed: "My child said that there seems to be something terrible in that city, making them feel very scared." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon hearing this, Su Ge immediately said: "The summoning has already begun, can't wait, and now enters the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the three people in Hills? It seems that only your bell can ease their fears," Vegginia said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger looked at the three people who were pale and pale, and said: "Let them sleep, and the spirit enters the kingdom of God."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerlos nodded and said, "This is a good way. I will protect my body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny said, "And me." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Su Ge used hypnotism to let them sleep, and Gerlos took the three people to the Kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Gerlos wakes up, it is certain that this method is useful. Su Ge and Randall have simply eaten breakfast and put on the night of pulling the wind. The uniform of the church, leaving the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has a special uniform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the style is similar, the logo on the Suger hat is a stretch of wings, a gun, a dead bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark clothes have a faint blue misty pattern on the neckline and cufflinks, as well as golden eye-catching embroidery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I can feel that the material of the clothes on the body of Su Ge and the materials of other people are not at all a level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Vanas's special material for Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall is very familiar with the entire misty mountain range, taking Su Ge all the way to the path, actually along the other way to the other side of the ancient city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it is a wall of more than ten meters high, it is difficult to fall two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfolding the two-wing Randall did not even need Su Ge to launch the black cloak, he took the Su Ge to the wall and came to the junction of the inner city and the outer city. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point the entire city has started fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at it, the two gates at the gate of the city, as Ryan said, were really demolished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the door being demolished, Suge clearly felt that something was missing here, leading to a mysterious, strange atmosphere in the entire city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the city wall was demolished, some people were left behind to guard it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person left behind is a butcher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mobility is not a strength, but his ability is terrible when defending his position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time at the forefront is not a dark star, but a gloomy Horace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as before, even if it is a traitor, the church will not discard it at will, but will exert his remaining value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug also saw the holy god who stood in the middle and kept his eyes closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point he seems to have regained the temperament when the two met for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three bishops were not idle at the moment, and they also personally fought while deploying the command to prevent the clergy from being attacked by the ten phantoms again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other mysteries of other organizations who come in with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are neatly dressed, well-equipped, alert, and sophisticated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are mixed with the Holy Swords, the Defenders, and are responsible for the realm and buffer around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men calmly stood at the intersection of the inner city and the outer city. Randall asked: "What should I do next?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly said: "Wait, just now, we need to highlight our existence and mystery, don't need to talk for a while, when they notice us, look faintly They glanced at it and turned away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall listened to the corner of the mask and knocked it up: "This is what I am good at."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the church is ready and the progress is very fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in ten minutes, a person has already advanced to the door of the inner city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look!" At this time the scout hurriedly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone heard and looked up, just to see two figures standing on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's the high vampire!" Someone recognized the badge on the top of Randall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is the second? From the perspective of the texture and material of the attire, the status is much higher than that of the higher vampire." A clergyman shocked . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the sign on his head!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone saw Sue’s head After the sign of the four wings of death, suddenly his face changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because yesterday, they saw the deity of the Four Wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge slightly moved the cane in his hand, and everyone suddenly looked down and looked eccentric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father opened his eyes and looked at his windbreaker, with a hat and a mask, like a person, mysterious and powerful Su Ge, his face is complicated . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under waiting for everyone to talk, Su Ge faintly glanced at the crowd and took Randall to turn and walk from the 20-meter-high wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloak flutters, the robes are hunting, they only look at Su Ge's graceful and calm, easy to fall from the wall, and finally disappear into their vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bit of a complicated look, the sacred words were a little numb, and Laurie’s eyes were brilliant, because his predictions for Su Ge were completely correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that the church of the late bell? It's really powerful!" a team of mysterious people wearing a khaki robes sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strong? Is this powerful? It’s just a small organization that’s not worth mentioning.” The mysterious man in dark gold armor smirked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The incomparably difficult guy." The four colleges in the distance gave a unified evaluation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young prostitutes in their early twenties, after seeing this figure, are full of excitement and excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because these two people are really handsome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it’s clothes, gestures, or the ability to drift off the wall, it became the yearning and fantasies of these students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The evening church..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, the evening church mentioned in the meeting yesterday The one-sided image has become vivid and deeply engraved in the depths of these two and two fantasy students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somewhere in the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless skeletons stacked together, and in the most central places, there is a huge existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don't know what shape the huge existence has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they know that the existence is empty at this time and needs enough sacrifices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This huge, indescribable thing is the shell of the Holy Grail of the soul that they summoned through countless lives and bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this shell is like a hungry monster, eager for content, eager for more sacrifices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The door was demolished, it seems that the church has finally come to a knowledgeable line." The giant emperor said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley put his hands behind him: "No need to worry, go to war. Now you need soul and flesh. But the battlefield must be around the palace so that you can waste The least energy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Giant Emperor nodded slightly and turned to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a few steps away, he stopped and asked coldly: "So what do you do for us?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
