			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps: For the lord's purple hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When everyone was silent, Father Hank suddenly said: "Learning is only one aspect, and more importantly, his heart. When I first saw him In the church hospital, in order to prevent the soul of the victim from becoming a grievance, he lost the opportunity of redemption and drank the potion of the master of Geros. At that time, his stomach was ulcerated, the esophagus was burned, and the pustules and blisters filled his mouth. I can't say anything, it makes people look very unbearable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Anthony sighed: "Yes, I was there at the time. At that time, the priests went to the capital." After participating in the selection of the hymns, the whole city of Bain left Su Ge, a newcomer who had just become a priest for less than a week. At that time, the situation was urgent, and dozens of people died. He suffered from inhuman suffering. This glorious mission."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marlene continues to earnestly say: "He is also a very kind and decisive person who treats the enemy and never treats himself. People are as warm as the spring breeze. He likes to help small animals and tramps, give them clothes in the winter. Food "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp At this time, due to the question of Ida, her vague memory of Ida will be passed on to the Scottish body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of praise, the five bishops will record these situations, and they can be used in future evaluations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they also discovered that this Suger Sotos' achievement in the future is not something they can estimate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Record it now, maybe it will be close at some point in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone was very surprised by the serious and sincere evaluation of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have just seen the detailed resume of Su Ge in the past, the rigid words and the effect of the dictation by the parties can be said to be the difference between the clouds and the mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Emilia’s evaluation of Su Ge has also improved a grade. Others may have false elements, but Father Water’s words are absolutely worthy of trust. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side, she can feel through her own abilities that everyone who has just spoken is true, and that kind of true feelings cannot be disguised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then it was settled. As the pioneer of the church in the kingdom of Guinness, it was Su Ge Sotos." Emilia directly concluded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Agree!" everyone said in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downstairs, Su Ge, who was waiting quietly, suddenly felt his nose itch and made a big sneeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened? Is someone chanting me, or is it going to catch a cold?" Su Ge groaned in his nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Father Anthony and others upstairs came down with a long snake, and after seeing Su Ge, they smiled and did not speak and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugeton felt bad in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Accordingly, the promotion and salary increase will definitely bring more heavy work. My God, give me a promotion and raise, not Is it because there are any difficult tasks to hand over to me?" Su Ge jumped in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the white-dressed nun came over and smiled slightly: "Please!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiles, Followed by two people to go back upstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting again in the immediate position, Su Ge found that the attitude of the five bishops to themselves suddenly changed a lot, from the coldness seems to be a lot of enthusiasm, It seems to be a good friend from a stranger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change makes Su Ge's heart more virtual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like the boss will smile and talk to you before every important job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emilia said with a smile: "I know that you have absolute loyalty to the church and absolute faith in the goddess, right?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure!" Su Ge’s heart jumped, but his face was very calm and nodded: "Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The smile of Emilia's mouth is slightly enlarged: "There is now a sacred mission to help our Church of the Holy Blood expand the influence of the church and spread the light of the goddess. I think it will be very happy to accept it, right? Just like you just said. To spread the goddess of glory as our responsibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!? I said it when I was?" When I heard this Sugton, I was so arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhogan suddenly coughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug immediately returned to the righteous color and nodded: "Yes! As I just said, to spread the goddess of glory as my responsibility, I can accept this task is My greatest honour, the Archbishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, the leader said that I said, I said." At this moment, Su Ge suddenly felt that he was back. During the working hours of the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile of Emilia’s mouth is big, and she said with satisfaction: “The goddess will feel happy for your dedication.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Emilia said that she was preparing to enter the Principality of Guinness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened, and said in his heart: "The Kingdom of Guinness? It seems to be the country of Vanas."<br /><br />&nbsp; Emilia explained: "Now the Principality of Guinness is in civil strife. The old king has just died. The current emperor is the granddaughter of the old king, Vanas Guinness. Her situation is very difficult. The strength is growing because of the addition of those cults. Many aristocrats have joined the imperialism, and continue to do so. The whole kingdom will be completely destroyed within half a year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Suge tempted to ask: "What can I do in the past? I don't know what war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The purpose of your past is very simple, Help us determine what is going on in China now, and how many cult forces we have. Finally, we will negotiate with Vanas Guinness as a messenger. If she is willing to accept the protection of the church, we can start from here and only need one day. Go to her capital, help her settle the civil strife and continue to rule."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard this Su Ge: "It turned out to be reconnaissance intelligence, and it sounds like the problem is not big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "When do you leave? How many people go together?" asked here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
