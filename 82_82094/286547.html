			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night, in the woods on the north side of the city, Connor tried to hold her breath and put her body on the back of a dead tree, covered with blood. Slowly squeeze the handle of the handle in your hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick! Find him! Never let him run! He is seriously injured and can't run!" Not far away, there was a messy voice. The dim gas lights flashed in the darkness, barely illuminating the corner of the lacquered black forest. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Connor exhales slowly, looking up at the dark sky underground passage in mind:. "The first time I felt March goddess is so pleasing to the eye" <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is high and the wind is high. It coincides with the cloudy sky. The clouds block all the three moons in the sky, so that the dark nights with good visibility on weekdays become darker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Assassin, brave. We are accompanied by darkness, cultivating hope, bullying the weak, we kill it; ignoring the law, we kill it; the loopholes in the law I am waiting to complete, and the nets filled with blood and corpses drag all the sinners, the sinners, and the shameless people into the abyss..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conner In my heart, I read the assassin's creed, and the body wearing black leather armor walked cautiously in the dark like a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assassins and hunters have many similarities, the commonality is patience and caution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these two qualities, Connor have both. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The damn assassin actually touched our mysterious workshop." In the dark, two hands hold the lantern, one hand with the pistol, shoulder to shoulder The two soldiers searching for said this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must kill him! Damn guy, killing so many brothers, now he has four shots, not far from death, wait for me to catch He won't let him die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He called Connor? It doesn't matter if you can't catch it, we can let the master curse him!"<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; companions listened and nodded, eyes suddenly surprised a moment when four weeks swipe: <br /> <br / "how your head with the ax!?" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Axe!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call!唰......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to wait for two people to react, two blood sprayed in the night, and the two died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After killing two people, Connor was unable to kneel on the ground, reaching for his mouth and not letting himself cough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that his injuries are very heavy, and a lot of blood flows along the gaps of his fingers as his hands lick his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The left lung was pierced, the abdomen was pierced, and there was a lot of blood in the abdominal cavity of the chest, which had affected the operation of the internal organs. Although the bullets under the left rib did not penetrate. The body, but when the skin is wiped, the capillaries are cut, the blood has flowed too much, and the body temperature cannot be maintained."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connor endured the tear The pain of the pain stood up, tightening the axe's difficult advancement, and still remembering the creed that he served since he was a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All spirits are equal in death, and our assassins use death as a sharp blade to purify all the filth in this world, all injustice..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a strong will cannot change the status quo of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After advancing tens of meters and killing four soldiers, he was found surrounded by people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen soldiers and four young men in black robes, holding green blades, staring at themselves, Connor trying to hold his breath and relieve the pain of the lungs And the feeling of suffocation, the left hand pinched the gun that had just been robbed, the right hand holding the short-handed axe that followed for many years, the dark eyes flashed with resoluteness and firmness, and it was very ordinary, but it was like a steel-like five words: I have long realized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These five words are the first day he joined the organization and the motto of his self. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the ancient assassin did not end, every assassination is accompanied by great risks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that every action is playing games with death, death, serious injury, disability, and madness are possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are even more horrible situations than these, but for these, Connor does not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he...has been awake! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These five words have run through his life, running through his 15 years of a total of 120 assassinations, running through him. The total number of sinful souls of 3,727 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He can't do it! Break his limbs! Don't let him die!" The fanatical black robe youth said slyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connor heard a sneer in his heart and sprinted forward with the final strength of his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The real assassin will not be exposed to fear, killing all witnesses, there is no risk of exposure!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Connor has learned over the years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, he kills at least 30 people every time he performs an assassination mission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest is death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The real assassin, will not run and fall before the assassination is completed!" Connor spit blood, his attitude is still calm and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His goal today is the young man who is screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as he kills him, even if he is dead, he has not violated all the creeds of his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He...speaking is a must! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the disadvantage is too great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When sprinting, a soft big net rushed to the surface, and tied him to the ground and could not break free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accurately, he has no strength to break free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't let you die!" The young man walked over and took out the green dagger, stabbing Connor's eyes, as if to dig his eyes,<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, it's a pity..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connor is pleased to accept death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was about to close his eyes, a muffled sound came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt a warm, sticky thing sprayed on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, the harsh screams came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was struggling to open his eyes that could not be opened, and found that the young man’s head had been smashed by something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking up, a female knight wearing silver-gray heavy armor looked down at herself, the blood-stained sword squatted on her shoulders, bowed her head and grinned at herself. : "Hey! Frenzy bloody axe lord! Your willpower is recognized by the Holy Sword!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, her body left like a gust of wind and began Bloody killings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her is a woman with a tail and a scale full of scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two bodies dance in the night sky, like an invisible ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in ten seconds, more than a dozen people died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people died very badly, some were violently torn off their heads, the entire spine was pulled out of the body with his head, very bloody horror . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a chest that was completely flattened, and a huge depression made people horrified...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connor Those who have experienced great winds and waves, whispered: "Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
