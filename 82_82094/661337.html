Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least for you, not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sughaha smiled and hugged her Tao: "In the mysterious world, there is no quantification of the existence of the gods, the concept of size. Although the bell is only a trace of divinity, but this silk is still divine. On this silk, I do not know How many humans can be erased, I don’t know how many people can be scared.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uplifting the holy grail of the soul of the right hand, Su Ge sighs: “The Holy Grail of Soul not only strengthens me. The soul makes my inspiration more powerful. It is constantly deepening the firmness and extensibility of my soul. It is both the induction and resonance of my present will and the body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Before I needed to feel the gods in the fantasy, but now I can feel the gods lying here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley Turning to look at the Holy Grail of Sog on the back of Su Ge, after a few seconds of silence: "However, the Holy Grail of the Soul is not so useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I have paid the public grain, can you not dismantle my desk?" Su Ge asked some grievances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley’s lips are lifted, the evil charm smiles, and the arms are held back against Suge’s shoulders, so that Su Ge’s head rests on his tall and tall On the chest, he nodded slightly: "There is finally something like being a man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge: "0..0"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..................<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Duke Hausmann's manor has a large number of Yi people's fluctuations, it seems that what attracted the attention of the Yi people." In the church, the guardian Marlene reported. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop Laurie nodded slightly: "You can go to rest, the goddess will remember your achievements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your approval." Marlene's standard salute, leaving the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the back of Marlene’s departure, Archbishop Laurie’s mouth slightly reveals a strange smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return to the temple of prayer on the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only two people in Salou and Laurie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the situation?" asked Saru, who had finished the prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie replied: "Duke Haussmann seems to have some relationship with Suger Sotos. At the same time, there have been a large number of Dais gathering, this love The antique guy is very likely to get something that shouldn't be touched."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing Duke, Archbishop Saru frowned slightly and said: "They are The famous unbelievers have great prestige and wealth in the whole world. We can't rush to him, or the shock caused by it is not so good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nod in it: "Understand that although we are not convenient, we can send our dogs to the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saru listened with a slight smile: "This plan is It’s perfect.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Duke of Merris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still the bedroom of Merris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Merris lay there motionless, and there were two older female warlocks who looked like 50 or 60 years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After these two old men, there are a total of fifteen female warlocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These female warlocks are aged between 20 and 30, and they look beautiful and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it weren’t for the fear and sluggish eyes of these women’s faces, it should be a beautiful view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the Chairman’s order. Now you will attack immediately, and use the cover of the night to go to Duke Hausmann Manor and bring back the four traitors. The whole process can be done without worrying about whether there is a living thing. I will equip you with a cold-hearted church. The people of the Institute of Polar Studies will help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking is a hair White daddy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five fifteen warlocks listened to their look and immediately nodded and said: "Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, turn and leave quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these people left, the two dad closed their eyes and communicated with Meris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now nine female warlocks have had a relationship with Drake. According to our observations, the evil spirit in Drake's body is very greedy. In the process, the tentacles are very unkind and deep into their bodies. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is precisely because of this that we have gathered enough enthusiasm and Divinity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Merris’s spirit can make a burst of satisfactory volatility, then hard to send out his will: “Continue, we accumulate The more ecstasy and divinity, the stronger our gods will be at that time. When we suck the god, we can make his sacrifice a sacrifice for our gods."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man with white hair immediately said: "Chairman, victory is in front of you, please hold on. As long as you have my own god, we can get rid of the control of the Holy Blood Church and start our great Reinstatement plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merris Micro-nod: "Don't keep this time. The Church of the Holy Blood is expected to acquiesce in our attack on Duke. And Sogo Sotos will fear the means of the Church of the Holy Blood and will not dare to shoot. Otherwise he will not be a woman warlock. Send it there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time, you must smash the roots! And bring back the treasure that can attract the Yi people!" Merris finally had a tough time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men nodded in a hurry and expressed their understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hausman Family Estate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncle Wright has been carried down and several people have changed to a living room to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Kas, the deputy bishop of the evening bell church in Hui Yao City." Kas briefed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke hurriedly nodded, holding his hand warmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that desperate time, Kas represents the great Lord suddenly appeared, so that he loves the house and Uzbekistan also has a very good feeling for Kas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief introduction to each other, return to normal Stephen's temptation: "Just, is that the great master of the gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass faintly replied: "That is just a corner of my great great power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this In the description, the two people began to have a stormy wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is God, in the heart of two people only know that it is very powerful, terrifying, but there is no quantitative concept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, they found that the existence of the gods far exceeded their previous expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass said to Duke: "You are doing very well today. You think that you will become a devout believer. During the day, The adult of the bell should have told you about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Watch the bell man? Is it... Mr. Black Mist?" Duke tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass did not answer and continued: "So now, your desire, your dreams, your long-cherished wishes, your hopes will be realized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Kas stood up directly and watched the exhaled voice of the crowd: "Now six of you are qualified to follow me into the Kingdom of God." !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
