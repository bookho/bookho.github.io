			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Duke’s serious look, Su Ge said calmly: “You have to think clearly, this situation has no turning back.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke is a real smart person. After hearing the accused tone of Su Ge, he bowed his head for a moment and then said a little, "Thank you for your reminder, I am calming down now." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "Sometimes, the greatest danger to a person is curiosity, you can control your curiosity, it makes people Admiration."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl heard this stunned Su Ge, the look is: "You are the kind of waste that can't control your curiosity." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge did not see it, directly ignored it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke then handed over two Langkes with a face value of 100 and said seriously: "Thank you for your warning, this is my wish." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugco did not have the habit of not paying attention to the money, took a look at the two paper money with a smile, turned around and looked around, calmly said: "The kind The incredible presence will not come here for no reason. You just said that you are a collector and an antique lover. Then you have time to take care of what you carry with you and see if it is contaminated with something that is not clean. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Duke looked at it and said, "I suddenly remembered it..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" At this moment, a knock at the door came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke asked calmly: "Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, distinguished ho Mr. Sman, I am the deputy captain of the Saronic Ocean Cruise, Mara Marchi. There were some things on the boat last night that needed your cooperation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Outside the door, there was a voice from Marchi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard this sound, Duke was silent for a second, then sorted out his expression and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the door, Marchi stood there with two security guards, first giving Duke a salute, then seriously said: "Last night, the cruise was attacked by some people, we found a passenger on the deck The body, according to other passengers' sightings, your butler, Mr. Stephen had had several contacts with that passenger, and we hope to get to know Mr. Stephen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Duke listened to his look and then said straightforwardly: "Please come in, although I really want to help you, but my butler seems to have been attacked yesterday."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marchi did not speak, took people into the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just coming in, she immediately saw Sug and Sherry standing aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing two people, Marchi’s state was very unexpected: “Mr. Assass, how are you here?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly replied: "I met Mr. Hausmann this morning. He said that his butler had problems and needed my psychological counseling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "What about Mr. Stephen?" asked Marchi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge pointed to the ground: "I have already slept under my psychological counseling, and his spirit has collapsed because of the skyrocketing spirit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marki listened to more accidents, looked down at the unmoving butler, and then said: "It’s a matter of life, I hope Mr. Hausmann can take you. The butler cooperates with our investigation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to investigate? He is now crazy." Duke said with dissatisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marki said with a distressed voice: "I apologize for Mr. Stephen, but this process still has to go."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at Marchi and asked, "How many dead have you died?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Markey has no concealment, normal He said: "There are four people who have died, and they all seem to be drowned, but the way they die is too strange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All drowned ?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marchi thought about it and nodded. "Well, it’s all drowned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge silenced and said: "A survey of Mr. Hausmann I don’t need it, I will investigate it here, and then I will give an account to Captain Macock.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dow heard this, Duke was surprised and looked Su Ge’s eyes changed a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...not so good?" Marchie looked very embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly said: "It’s just fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malkey is a bit tangled, After a while, I still left with someone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After three people left, Duke said with great gratitude: "Thank you for your help, thank you very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and waved his hand and said, "Protecting the patient is the responsibility of the doctor. You can continue our topic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke After hearing it, he nodded and said: "We went to an antique market when passing by Ocean City. Then we bought a statue of Qingtong from the hands of an old sailor. It seems that there should be thousands of years according to my analysis. The history, so I let Steven put the statue away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I don't know why, after we got the statue, we experienced several bad luck. We originally planned to go to the Lionheart City, the capital of the Lion Empire through Ocean City. However, a disaster broke out and we had to be forced. Return."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Duke’s face is unhappy and unwilling<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The person who just died, what is the relationship with you?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke heard a look of disgust on his face: "That is a real rogue, he doesn't know where to know that I have the statue in my hand." I have been entangled with us. I even cursed me after a fight. I came back with a lot of things, so I didn’t intend to cause trouble. I asked Steven to contact him, hoping to spend some money." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge sighed: "It seems that the result is not satisfactory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, he stared at the statue like a demon, I know that statue Very valuable, naturally will not give him. After several invalid negotiations, he even madly entered my room to steal, but it was good to be discovered by my servants in time."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, the bodyguards on the side of the face are slightly chested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday he discovered the thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke continued: "I made people smash his slap and throw him out. Let Stephen go and warn him." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After he was crazy?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke shook his head: "September last night, Stephen was still normal, just saying that he was a little dizzy, it was raining last night, I thought he It was so cold that he let him go to rest. When he got to this morning, he suddenly rushed over and grabbed and bite me again, but he was subdued by my two heroic bodyguards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Su Ge touched his chin and asked, "Do you think there are many coincidences in this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duke’s face flashed a haze: “I can feel it, I also feel that there is a problem with the statue, so I will come over.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su I shook my head and said, "I don't know about mystery. You are afraid of being disappointed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you have enough experience and knowledge, right? Mr. Black Mist," Duke said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg listened to a glimpse, then smiled and said: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Mr. Black Mist is the name of the flower used by Su Ge in this year and a half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and this name has a certain reputation in the adventure world, the tomb community, and related historical antiques. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
