			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone walked out of the ward, and Su Ge looked at the undecided doctor and gave him a quiet rumor: "When can he wake up?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor can naturally feel Su Ge’s favor to himself. First of all, he is grateful, then he answered seriously: “It should wake up within forty-eight hours, and his will is no problem. As long as it is our surgery, I am afraid that he will suddenly wake up, and the anesthetic used is excessive..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, the doctor is a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge patted him on the shoulder and smiled: "This is not your problem, you are also kind. Help me take care of him, wake up when you want to One time notice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Looking at Su Ge’s smile, the doctor did not know why the heart produced a kind of trust and recognition, and nodded hard. Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corridor, Sug saw Randall bringing five servants this time, four men and one woman, each handsome and handsome, dressed in neat black deacon Clothing, cold expression, standing there has a shocking atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sug came out, five people were worried about their squatting at the same time: "See Mr.!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Illina heard a flash of light in this eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See you? This is not the name for the gentleman. The visit is for the emperor and the king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Su Ge nodded slightly, not much to say that he was ready to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., don’t you really have to bring a follower?" asked Randall tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it’s not too dangerous to go out this time, I can handle it myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say, Su Ge looks at Randall in a positive color: "You are the hidden card I am hiding now. Don't let any outsiders know about your existence. If necessary, deal with it all, understand?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall opened his mouth and revealed a pair of sharp fangs: "You can rest assured that this is what we are best at."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you finish this, Su Ge Simply ate breakfast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Milk, bacon, omelettes, broccoli, soft white bread, simple, yet balanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After breakfast, Maria took a letter and respectfully walked over and handed it to Su Ge: "Bishop Sotos, the letter is ready. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took the white envelope and looked at the bright red seal that should have a royal seal in the middle, and put it in the pocket of the chest. Thank you. Get up and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just out of the castle, I saw a gloomy mil on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not caught!?" Su Ge looked shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill bites his teeth: "These two people have high-handed guidance, he is very clear about my limitations, two people quickly walked around, when I rushed At that time, I have been in the carriage for three minutes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has some accidents, sorting out his black silk hat hat: "With Randall to help you, Your stress will be reduced a lot, so you should change it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill knows the truth and looks up at Su Ge: "Yes, you Go out this time, if it is convenient, it is best to go around the Duke of the Mountain Range."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill Shen's explanation: "About three months ago, I felt a strange sensible flash. I didn't pay much attention to it. From the current situation, the Duke of the Mountain, the death sect The Institute of Polar Studies seems to have been fully tacitly united. The Duke of the Mountain does not have such power and does not have such wisdom. I estimate them. I summoned some bad things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge nodded: "Well, I will pay attention."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is for you!" Mill took out a small black porcelain bottle from his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next-class dragon potion, you can double your body and spirit in ten minutes after taking it. Toxicity fifteen Point," Mill explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not interested in this thing." Su Ge pushed his hand back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The future is dangerous. If you encounter any problems, drink it. Even if you suffer some hardships and pains, you will be better than death." Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this rhetoric, Su Ge could not refuse, and politely thanked him after receiving the potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time the secret carriage was taken out of the palace castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Suge got off the Central area and was ready to return to the inner area from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most lively place, and the most chaotic place. It is the most intensive place for mysterious people to interact. The purpose of Su Ge’s coming out is to do things. All of them are very eager for a mysterious duel at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood at a crossroads looking at the pedestrians and scenery around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The style here is not much different from the city of Bain. The streets are paved with stone bricks. Although some are uneven, they are at least not rainy. And muddy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four-storey red-brick houses on both sides of the road. Because of the location in the north, the winter smog hangs on the wall and turns the red brick into gray. brick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Thursday at 9:30 am, it’s already working hours, so there aren’t many pedestrians on the street, and the streets are side by side, and the streets are a bit deserted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge simply distinguishes the direction and prepares to go inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he progressed less than a hundred meters, he suddenly felt a sharp psionic wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expensive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whistling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the corner about 20 meters in front of Su Ge, Along with a low dragon, a huge pillar of fire appeared out of thin air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the appearance of the pillar of fire, Su Ge stood here and felt the heat coming from the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedestrians around seem to be used to it, not shouting, quietly turning and running, calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five seconds later, the pillar of fire disappeared, and a completely burnt body fell to the ground, emitting black smoke and motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman wearing a dark red short cannon with a witch hat strolled over and stooped to pick up an unburned parcel in the body of the corpse. Turn around and get ready to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the woman’s body suddenly froze, and then she stretched out her own hands and pinched her neck, pinching hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How does this scene seem to have met?" Su Ge saw this, his thoughts were awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the first time he was attacked by a real mystery. If it wasn’t for the second, he was already killed by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that the same encounter has resonated with Su Ge, and Suge is ready to help her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when he just lifted his foot, he found that the woman actually broke free and was breathing heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when Su Ge thought it was okay, suddenly...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glaring stray fly However, the woman’s body was directly sieved, and the red blood overflowed with the dark red robes, and the eyes under the witch’s hat were violently unwilling to fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the woman fell, the corner of the corner ran out to a young man in black with a short submachine gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
