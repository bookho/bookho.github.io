			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When listening to Elena’s remarks, Vanas breathed a little bit rushed, his face was flushed, his eyes sparkling, his heart was dark. "The Pope's majesty is really a no-brainer. I have already counted this step. Not only did I figure out that I would send someone to go out to investigate, but I also saw that Elena was my own, and I was concealed by such a subtle method. At the same time, we have achieved the trust of Elena at the same time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The perfect time to control, by calculating the habit of the Duke of the Mountain Range in advance, showing the enemy Killing all of them with weakness, showing their strength and getting such important information!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Vanas heart plops Beating: "This kind of wise and wise Pope will come here to help me. Our Guinness Kingdom is bound to prosper forever. Those small and rebel parties will soon fall under the majesty of the Pope. The brilliance will soon cover the entire king of Guinness The redemptive bell will reverberate in my kingdom forever, protecting our kingdom and people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, what happened to you?" Eli Na saw that her Majesty seemed a little weird today. At this time, her squatting looks like a little girl fanning about her inner idol. The wheezing is aggravated. The chest under the luxurious long skirt is undulating, and the eyes are full of confusion and reverence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas is now returning to God, will soon converge on the inner excitement, Chang Shu breathed back to the past mature and mature look: "See you just Said, bringing my heart into it, I am very excited at the same time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, she immediately transformed the topic and said with sadness: That Casey and Tom..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene clenched his fist and said: "Since I am back, I will revenge for them."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Elena left a man and a woman, but the two were killed by the people of the Institute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time the two sides encountered, two people were directly killed by that tentacle. The aftermath of the tentacle shattered Elena's lungs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is still unclear about Vanas’s brain-filling situation, and the temperature and the advice of the saying: “The dead are like this, their sacrifice is not meaningless. At least let you meet me and lay a solid foundation for future success."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena took a deep breath and nodded hard and said, "Yes! I want to live with their ambitions! Burn out those bastards!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting across the street, Vanas heard this Su Ge, and sighed in his heart: "This kind of reassuring tone, this hopeful vocabulary, it seems that the Pope has calculated all the circumstances. Clearly, and made a perfect plan, already winning the prize!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Vanas can't help but shudder, the body looks like The electricity is the same, the skin under the red skirt has a layer of goose bumps, and the body seems to be stimulated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the Pope squats to make me a partner, how good!" Vanas, who was excited and shuddered, suddenly thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Vanas is most admired for her own beliefs, she can always dedicate herself to her own Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for that perfect existence, she dare not have too many ideas, because that kind of existence is supreme, let yourself be that one The idea of ​​a partner is itself a huge disrespect and embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Pope is different, the Pope is a real person, and compared to the Lord’s deep and majestic, like the abyss, the Pope’s majesty Going up is so amiable, so approachable, it looks like a handsome and courteous gentleman, full of realism and intimacy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty! I will wake him up now and let you personally ask!" Elena did not find Vanas’ spring heart, and got up and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas rubbed his eyes and returned to God. He said in a steady tone: "This is not an emergency. I am just an ordinary person. I can’t judge the truth of his speech. If you take it to Grandpa Mill, let him see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling this grandfather of Mil, Elena pouted: "Okay! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out, she doesn't seem to like this grandfather." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the group got up, Vana Stowe walked in the flaming dress and walked at the forefront with an elegant pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Irina and Su Ge walked side by side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at Vanas’s slender and beautiful back, listening to the crisp sound of high-heeled shoes and the floor, feeling the noble and elegant temperament, in my heart The dark passage: "When can I temper this temperament?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today he still has not emerged from the shadow that Luke despised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After crossing the second floor corridor, everyone walked up the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge whispered to Elena: "Who is this grandfather of Mil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vanas, who is feeling the Su Ge movement in front of his head, waits for Elena to open his mouth and immediately says: "Mir is a very powerful and experienced demon hunter. He is a good friend and mystery teacher of my grandfather. For many years, we have been secretly protecting our royal family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty! This is a secret, this businessman is an outsider!" In the armor, the strong and handsome blond youth hurriedly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas raised his hand slightly and said faintly: "He is the partner of the chief of staff, and the savior of the chief of staff, that is my partner and The savior, Mr. Sotos is completely worthy of trust!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Elena’s heart was so touched, she looked at Su Ge and looked Pride, that seems to say: "How? My relationship with the Queen? Good enough!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and nodded, and said in his heart: You are happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blond handsome guy still wants to talk, but Vanes has a look back, and then he is unwilling to resume silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although silence is not idle, eyes continue to sweep over Su Ge, the face of doubt and gloom, seems to warn Su Ge to be honest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug saw this sigh: "Vanas’s heart is not enough! Although this is to protect me, it has been done a little. This kind of The move is simply putting me on the fire. After all, other people don't know the relationship between us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
