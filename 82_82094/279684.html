			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking on the neat bluestone road, Su Ge looked up to see the huge alarm bell above the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking forward is a wide passage that is like a mountain, with towering walls on either side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is both the main thoroughfare and the second line of defense after the city gate breaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire passage looks at least two hundred meters, with nothing on either side, and a high wall of at least twenty meters high gives a feeling of depression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina’s status seems to be very high. After entering, he can move freely without the guidance and supervision of soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people walked in front, behind them two soldiers carrying a stretcher, above which is still in a state of dizziness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilana is very valued for this person. In the middle of the other few people want to help, she is directly rejected, only claiming two of their most trusted people to follow Lift him into the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five minutes later, two people walked along the city road and first saw a very wide white square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge statue ten meters high in the middle of the square. It looks like a majestic middle-aged man in armor. Due to the war, the surrounding fountains have stopped. But it does not affect the overall magnificence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the square as the center, there are seven roads that want to radiate in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven roads correspond to a heavy and heavy gate and a large number of guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina enters the third door on the left with Su Ge, and then passes through a flower bed and enters the grand palace of silver ash from the side door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the front door, I saw a porch and a straight corridor. The two guards at the door saw the sudden appearance of the person, ready to pull out. The moment of the gun saw the look of Elena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The curtain is long!" The two men hurriedly put down their weapons and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina nodded and asked, "Where is the Queen now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Queen The time should be working in the study." The guard immediately answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, work hard, we are victorious!" Elena encouraged a sentence and moved forward quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge walked and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This palace does not have the golden glow of his imagination, giving people more feelings of elegance and simplicity, as if after a baptism of years, a slightly yellowed page, Has a unique charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the promenade, two people just came to the hall, just to see a middle-aged woman wearing a black deacon suit with four maids holding plates Going upstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sergeant! Why don't you say hello and suddenly come back!" The middle-aged woman was surprised to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina said with a smile: "Long time no see, Maria."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete It was quite smooth, and I found some important clues, so I quickly rushed back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary’s middle-aged woman nodded slightly, then her eyes fell On Su Ge: "This is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Suger Sotos, a powerful businessman. I This time I went out and was attacked and almost lost my life. He saved me. Without him, I guess I can’t come back.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maria listened to the demeanor Amazed, then grateful to say: "Thank you, kind Mr. Sotos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled slightly: "Helping beautiful ladies, themselves It is the most basic principle of a gentleman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the Queen doing now? I have important information." Elena said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maria said directly: "The Queen is meeting with Prince Sacco."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is this guy again? Has the Queen not completely rejected him?" Na doesn't seem to like this guy very much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary sighed: "This time Prince Sacco seems to have a well-thought-out. He has recently married a lot of nobles. This time he came with him. Marquis, Marquis of Clinton."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, take us over!" Elena did not hesitate, and took a strong lead to go up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary hurriedly said: "This does not seem to meet the number of rituals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina Apricot eyes: "All the time, what kind of rituals are still spoken, the bastard is the Queen’s former schoolmaster who always touches the Queen’s hands and feet, no prince style, if I, I burned him a long time ago. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maria's maid knows the temper of this person and says, "Let's be a little steady, wait until we are advanced to inform you, you go in again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay!" Elena did not make her embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following Maria upstairs, walked up the second floor and walked about 20 meters down the corridor, stopped in front of the third door and waited quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary knocked on the door and smiled and said, "Queen, tea is ready."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it so slow?" Vanas was calm and came with a hoarse voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The voice in her reality is much better than the voice in her dreams." Su Ge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come here, Su Ge suddenly has a sense of tension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you feel like a base with a netizen? The heart can't help but accelerate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Su Ge is not like two men and women in online dating, worried that the other party can not look at themselves. I am worried that the performance of the Pope will be too frustrating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will pay attention to it later!" Su Ge made up his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty the Queen, this situation is in our country, these maids will be guilty of death. When the King’s majesty received the guests, it was delayed for so long. I can be disrespectful. If you need it, I can give you a group of my carefully selected servants, which are much more professional than these rude people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There was a greasy and squeaky voice in the room, which made people feel bored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas’ voice came: “I don’t need you to worry about my business.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary's demeanor said calmly: "It was the aides who came back, just met with their subordinates and said A few words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Irina is back!?" Vanas's voice has improved significantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the chief of staff said that important information needs to be reported to you now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Let her come in!" Vanas said immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary responded with a temptation. "The sergeant brought back a person and said that he is a strong businessman, and he is very trustworthy to the chief of staff." Partner, need to bring it together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since it is a partner of the chief of staff, it must be my friend, let him come in with the chief of staff."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten seconds, the door opens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary reached out and said, "Two, please."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina I walked in very calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Su Ge took a deep breath, first gave himself a meditation, then let his appearance show enough calm and calm, while trying to maintain The elegance and mystery of oneself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
