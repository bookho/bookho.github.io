			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, everyone looked through the tree wall and looked at the strangest Su Ge on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you say that he can really hear the voice of the deceased?" a police officer asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland shook his head and said, "I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack frowned at Su Ge and said: " It seems that he is not pretending to be dressed up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has returned to God!" Roland said, and several people turned and waited at the same time, acting. Very clever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stood up and returned to the body. At this time, the body had no horrible smell, but was full of peace and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the resentment and fear disappeared, the body became less horrible." Su Ge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a slap in the body, Sug turned his head and said, "Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Jack hurriedly asked: "Find the murderer!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack at this time and the previous indifference are two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is silent, and looks positive: "I advise you that you still don't know, I will report this matter directly to the church." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, everyone’s eyes flashed a horror, and shutting up silence was not asking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The body can be put away, be careful to bury it!" Su Ge finished, holding his forehead and sitting down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of operations have exhausted all of his few psionics, and he feels a stinging forehead and some dizziness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you okay?" Careful Roland saw that Su Ge's face was not very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug shook his head and smiled: "Some over-consumption, just take a break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;When the police cleaned up the body, Su Ge’s heart said: “I think it’s right. My ability for the average person can really improve their soul. Under normal circumstances, the normal person’s vision is only 0 or 1 If you want to see the extraordinary event, it will be at least 10 points. That is to say, just hearing the sound of the soul can make people's vision skyrocket by 10 points!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The more horrible, the more knowledge there contains, the more significant the improvement of the vision. I heard that the voice of the deceased only increased by 1 point, and the voice of this soul can improve at least 10 points of vision. This sound is true. So horrible!?" I thought of this Su Ge brow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point he suddenly discovered that he was very vague about the concept of his own power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After fifteen minutes, the body was finished and left the park with two police officers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, I think you need a cup of coffee to refresh yourself." Jack walked over and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stood up and nodded and said, "Yes, for high-enriched coffee without sugar and milk, I am not only in bad spirits, but my head still hurts." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack smiled a little: "I will satisfy you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the police station, Su Ge found that Gerlos had returned and was saying this with Orson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the situation?" Ossen hurriedly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge True Color says: "It’s really related to mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss took the call : "Talk about it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said directly: "It is not a person who kills Chuck, but a mysterious monster, according to me and Chuck. The communication of the soul, it has huge teeth, body and...""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The description of the just described is detailed, and Gerlos directly said: "There is no Wrong, they are small ghouls. Their favorite food is the human brain, heart and liver."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small Ghoul!?" Su Ge A glimpse, so awkward wounds, is it just small? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeros explained: "It’s not that a small ghoul should be small, and its small is just a comparison with a giant ghoul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gerlos took a sip of coffee: "But I would rather deal with giant ghouls than to deal with small ghouls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Su Ge I don’t know anything about mysterious creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos explained at random: "The giant ghoul is similar in size to an elephant, but his brain is not easy to use. It doesn't matter except for rampage. But Small ghouls are different. They have the ability to become humans, and they are a little higher than humans in brain intelligence. They can easily be mixed in the middle of human beings, and they are not evil. They act cautiously, they are very embarrassed, and they are slightly swaying. It will disappear immediately, and you can lurk for several years at random."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ossen is not very good at the side: "According to the file, about fifteen years ago The empire’s finance minister is a small ghoul, whose true identity is the archbishop of the cold-hearted church.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Minister of Finance!” Suge listened to his head reaction But come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other novels and games, how often the most junk ghouls become so powerful here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a bit of a hassle." Gerlos was lost in thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Orson suddenly asked: "Right, Chuck is an ordinary person, why can he suddenly see a small ghoul?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small ghouls belong to the Yi family of 1 sequence, and they want to see that they must reach 13 or more. Does he say how his own vision has risen to this? What's the point?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge doesn't make a sound truth: "No, his soul is very chaotic, he doesn't even know he is dead. There is no logic in the mouth. He also calls me my father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Gerlos’ eyebrows said: "So It’s true that you’re really a godsman.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The priest will release the warmest energy when praying for the undead, so that the soul can get the most comfortable and safest feeling, so this When he becomes a priest, he is the most respected and favorite name of his loved one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Gerlos looked at Su Ge and said: "But to this extent, It’s not a little rookie who just became a god official.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger said with a smile: “You don’t make fun of me, just pray for him. I have already consumed all my psionic powers, I am dizzy now, my ears are ringing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss heard this nod and said: "Go Rest, you are doing very well this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ossen stretched out his thumb: "Make it beautiful, Agent Sotos, go to rest." !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squatted and walked along the guide to the tea pavilion on the first floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the sofa, Su Ge wouldn’t want to get up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that you really need a high concentration of plain coffee." With the sound coming, Sug nose asked for a very rich coffee taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your eyes and see Jack sitting across from him, pushing a cup of coffee that is still in the circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, you are such a good person, the goddess of March will bless you." Su Ge first blessed the blessing, took a small coffee and took a sip . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bitter, very bitter except for the incense of coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Su Ge does not care about this kind of suffering, because this kind of suffering can relieve pain and can refresh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you ask the madman?" Jack asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge slammed his forehead and said, "Forget it, I am too lazy to speak with my current energy, don't talk about interrogation."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
