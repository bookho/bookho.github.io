			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Su Ge and others were trapped, Marchi and others reassured their rituals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire ship, the people of the Cthulhu Church originally had fifteen people, and the Krakens that Moss summoned killed three, and now there are twelve people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the twelve men stood in the hall in a dark robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the entire venue hall has been completely blocked, everyone stunned on the ground, not moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of horrible flesh-and-blood monsters are constantly moving around the edge, killing all those who are ready to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, more than a dozen people have been stunned because of the skyrocketing spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the people are pale, the shock is undecided, one by one seems to insert the head into the ostrich in the grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marki’s calm voice sounded throughout the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you very much for participating in the ceremony of the birth of the great God, don't be afraid, we don't intend to treat all of you as sacrifices, just need some special A small number of qualified people, others will be very safe and become witnesses of the great true God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this person is first loose inside, but the next second is incomparable Tense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Marchi said it is clear that not everyone can be spared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, the fear of self-confidence is permeated throughout the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some timid youth and women can't help but cry out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marchy standing in the middle of the crowd took a deep breath at this moment, and a burst of deep thoughts filled her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her rumor, she can make others go crazy without falsification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on this basis, she needs to absorb enough special energy, which is the fear that people emit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scolding accuser, this profession is very rare to be able to manipulate two different mystical energies at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting a strong core knowledge requires not only psionic power, but also the fear that people radiate as a nourishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the fear in the hall is already full, and her preparation has reached its peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The high priest, the phalanx is ready, the ship anchoring coordinates are very precise, and the ceremony can be started."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the gloomy youth said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marqui nodded slightly, looking around with fear and despair, hands clasped together: "Beginning to pick the first offerings."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, in a period of fear and mourning, these cultists led the monsters to pick out twelve people from the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These have children, men, women, and two and a half hundred old people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't... Don't! March Goddess, save me! Help me!" Several of them are faithful followers of the March goddess, constantly crying Prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marchy snorted: "March Goddess? It’s just an illusory pseudo-god, so the guy who makes the mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on! Otherwise you ate you!" The cultist on the side said gloomyly, and the sly flesh-and-blood monster on the side stretched out the blood-filled shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This woman who looks like a painter suddenly twisted her face and screamed and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Others saw this more horrible, the whole body trembled, the monsters were terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just when everyone was in despair, a young man with a sullen face suddenly stood up and shouted: "It is dead anyway, and we have hundreds of people afraid of these ten people!? Kill them together!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, I don’t know where to take a knife and rush to the cult staff next to me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth suddenly promoted some young people who are about to go crazy, and then several young people suddenly violently rushed toward the cultists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actions of these people suddenly let the rest of the people see the hope. For a time, everyone is starting to move, everyone has the preparation to stand up and fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these people succeeded in killing a few cultists, it might indeed be a wave of counterattacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, unfortunately, their heroic counterattacks did not receive any return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These six people are still not close to the cultists, and one side of Marchi's hands wave forward; "I am giving you, crazy!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, under the gaze of everyone, the six men who were just brave and fearless suddenly became stiff, and then suddenly there was a burst of wild screams in their mouths, saliva and snot, distorted Got crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the crazy six people gave up the cultists and turned to attack each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very strange and bloody battle began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goddess is on, this is...this is the power of God!?" At this time everyone's spirit began to tremble fiercely, the fear was more intense, just rebellious The heart is completely shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten minutes later, the six young people tore each other's body is blood, not adult-like fell to the ground, like a beast that is about to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pungent bloody smell is permeated in the hall, people are dull looking at the intestines that have flowed to the ground, the eyes that have been pinched, torn Skin............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vomiting and vomiting......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dozens of people who are trembling all over the body, tears and noses are mixed together, like a child who is scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Malki’s calm and cold voice came: “I hope that you don’t question the power of the great true God, even if I don’t have my servant, I can rely on me alone. Let your hundreds of people play with the applause."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Markie’s mouth showed an evil smile: "Of course, I am very much looking forward to you. More brave counterattack, then I am not so boring, at least I can find some toys."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶嘶嘶! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, everyone sucked in a cold air, and the heart was chilling, and the soul trembled with fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, the entire hall was in a deadlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pegu on the ground pale pale whisper: "What to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jetta said calmly: "Wait, there are other high-ranking people on this ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke is not too good in the distance But still calm, because at this time he believes in Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this absolute silence, the twelve sacrifices were taken away from the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as they were about to leave the hall, an imposing voice remembered: "If I can, I am willing to exchange my life for their lives." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, everyone was shocked and hurriedly looked at the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time they saw a young man who was ugly and dressed in a plain suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth looks like a normal, but at this time the face is full of firmness and calmness, completely ignoring the power of those monsters and Marchi, looking directly at her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God! Who is this!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
