			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind of the night~~ Gently blows through<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the faint aroma of the orchid~~ ~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw my baby shivering~~ asked him what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovely Jerry looks pale~~~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the ghost in the night And ghosts~~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pub in the southwestern border of the Kingdom of Guinness A bard sings softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melody is very soothing, but the content is full of black and strange talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug was sitting at the table near the door of the pub, holding the rum in his hand, just taking a sip and not drinking too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not good at drinking, and ordering the cheapest rum is just to make himself not so out of place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days ago, Su Ge left Bain City, escorted the church personnel to the border, and successfully joined a caravan in the outbound supply station. In the territory of Guinness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the current fighting in Guinness is constant, the inspection of the border seems to be very strict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge can’t tell if they are Vanas or the Emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the inspection, Su Ge slightly used some mysterious means to easily pass the guard and enter the territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then followed the caravan for about half a day to come to this border town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Ge was surprised, the town was very peaceful, people lived as usual, orderly, not like the country in the civil war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After renting a very clean hotel for 6 nights, Su Ge came to the only pub in the town to check the news of the capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas said in more detail, she is ultimately a commander in the deep palace, the bottom of the residents of the real situation is much clearer than her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the pub is not small, it looks almost 150 square meters, there are more than 20 tables. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of being at the edge of the street, the pub's business is very good. Su Ge saw the merchants here, saw the mercenaries, and saw the soldiers who had been replaced and the local residents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should be a businessman on the side of the Bertrand Empire!?" At this moment, a rough voice sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge heard the sound and saw a strong, bearded yellow bearded, middle-aged man in a gray casual suit staring at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge brows and asks with a hint of curiosity: "How did you see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because only the merchants of your Berant will treat rum as a cocktail! Like a girl! Hahaha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Han said that he grabbed his own blackjack and poured a large half of the rum into his stomach and took a picture of the big belly with yellow fluff. "Rum, it should be like this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hahahaha! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment, some locals, mercenaries and soldiers followed and gave a cheerful laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug also laughed. He didn’t think it was a kind of demeaning or contempt. He lifted the cup slightly and sipped and grinned: “Learning It’s here!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s always the best way to get information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha! Young man! Jim is optimistic about you!" The brawny laughed and turned back to his seat to continue drinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge got a cup of wine and stood up. At this time, he also let go a lot. He walked to the next door and three soldiers who were guarded against it: "Come! Dedicated to protect our safety!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he has done a lot of work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three soldiers are not too old, and they seem to be enlisted for a year or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ha ha ha! Good! This Bellat's businessman is very good!" The other locals followed the screaming loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Soge so cool, the three soldiers also raised their cups and drank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sat down and grinned: "Would you come to Kunte?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three soldiers shook their heads, and the older black-haired soldier said: "We don't have time to play with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard a flash of light in his eyes The entourage took out his Kunte card from his arms and said: "That's a pity. I don't even have time to play. You should be very busy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The three soldiers seem to have gotten a command, and a flash of warning on their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black-haired youth continues: "If you want to play cards, go there, we are not interested."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled slightly: "That's a big sorry, big brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of getting up to the side of the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although it looks peaceful, these soldiers seem to have been given a password and are warning of something. They have a heavy grassy smell on them. It should have been just a few months since I came back from the mountains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Ge meditated, he suddenly heard a burst of crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the sound, Sug saw a man kneeling on the table, crying while drinking, and there seemed to be something sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look carefully, the man is wearing a shirt that is decent, although he does not wear a coat, but the pants and shoes can be seen. He is not an ordinary farmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Su Ge keen noticed that there was a square-shaped protrusion in his left pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he found his goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Su Ge casually found a place to sit down and asked: "What happened to that person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The blond mercenary who is eating meat gloats and said: "The son is missing, his wife and others ran. It has been here for two days, it is a tragedy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Su Ge in the heart of a move, took the wine glass and walked over to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roll! Laozi is in a bad mood today!" This young man in his thirties looks like a savage scream at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge puts his cards and cups down at the same time: "So always crying, your wife can't come back, your son can't come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man suddenly sat up, licking his red eyes and pinching the collar of Sug, spit out the smell of strong wine: "Outside people! Do you want to fight?" ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his hand: "It’s better to have a game of Kent if you are not interested in a fight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The young man looked down at the exquisite Kunte card in Su Ge’s hands, and his attention was gradually attracted: “Would you like Quinte?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a veteran!" Su Ge has a well-thought-out face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man slowly sat down and took a relatively old card from his trouser pocket and asked, "What is the gambling?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1 Langke?" Su Ge took out a golden banknote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people began to be skilled in shuffling: "You can't allow remorse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled Tao: "Reassured, the most important thing for businessmen is integrity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
