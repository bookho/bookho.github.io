			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two people arrived at the scene, they saw that the scene had been blocked by the police and pulled up the blockade line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of working hours, there is no one around to watch the fun, very quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jack!" The female police officer responsible for guarding the body nodded to Jack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack responded with a nod, and said that he should have heard of it, the detective sent by the church, Soge Sotos. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women listened to a lot of curious Su Ge, then smiled and reached out and said: "Roland Bowman."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug holds the hand in her hand, clearly feels that some cold palms are full of hard-working old man, laughing and saying: "I am very happy to work with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has a short black hair, looks mature and beautiful, tall and straight body is very well-proportioned, walking vigorously, the body is full of strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple chill after Roland turned and brought two people to the tree wall on the west side of the park. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the tree wall is a bench with a miserable body on the edge of the bench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body was wearing a worn cotton coat, the whole body was blood, slightly leaning on the past, Su Ge found that the head of this person was smashed, leaving a huge gap on the wound. Tooth marks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin body is full of smashing wounds, and even the chest is completely pierced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these wounds are not large, but instead look at the scratches left by the claws that are about the same size as humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I saw this scene, Su Ge felt his stomach tumbling and hurriedly asked: "Is there any other clues?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The time of the incident should be at one o'clock in the morning, there are no witnesses in the surrounding area, the victim's western heart, the liver is missing, no extra blood is seen around, no seeing any The footprints are like the murderer descending from the sky." Roland simply said the situation aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded after listening, and took a deep breath and said: "Can you temporarily empty the vicinity? I need a quiet environment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland and Jack finished A look at each other and then said: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both people know that Su Ge is from the Holy See, and how many can guess that Su Ge is related to mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two people left the place with the remaining police officers, and passed a corner along the road and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After identifying no one around, Su Ge resisted the urge to vomit, came to the body, reached out and gently put it on the broken arm of the body, closed The upper eye slowly releases its own psionic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the psionic energy emanated, Su Ge gradually turned from black to purple, and then there was a subtle mourning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough, still here." Su Ge closed his eyes and sighed toward the east of the body, and walked out about five meters to a dry Under the willow tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the mourning sound is very clear: "Don't, don't kill me! I haven't seen anything! Don't kill me!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge will gather psionics on his eyes and launch his own vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your eyes, Su Ge’s blue eyes sparkle with strange purple light, and the whole world becomes very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a lot of blood on the clean ground, as well as footprints stained with blood, and saw the blood drops gradually falling away from the footprints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning his head, he saw the soul of a gray body curled up under the tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This soul can't look like it, only a mist can be seen, because of the constant tremor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge’s eyes flashed a trace of compassion and harmony, using psionic powers, and the whole body exudes a warm and soft atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the basic ability of the priest, the soul is friendly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feel the warm breath of the soul gradually stopped shaking, gradually closer to the side, said: "!! Father, I'm so afraid that monster, he'll kill me he was going to kill me" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul is very embarrassing, he does not know that he is dead, and even can not recognize who Su Ge is, everything depends on instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s hand touched out gently, with a gentle and soft tone: “My child, don’t be afraid, the monster has been driven away, you are now It’s safe.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the trembling of the soul has come down, the emotion of fear has gradually dissipated, and it has fallen into peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does that monster look like? The father goes to find him and exhales for you." Su Ge sorted out the language and asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul trembled again, but at this time he snuggled in Su Ge’s arms and said: "He is scary, he has festering skin, a huge mouth, The body is about the same as a human, but with his claws and soles. He is very fast and has bloody eyes. He said... He said that I saw him, and I must die."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge quickly wrote down the story, determined that after the mysterious monster committed the crime, released his own spirit to appease: "My child, don't be afraid. You have returned to the March goddess Embrace, let go of your body and mind, and welcome a new life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul seems to realize what, the gray fog gradually forms a vague humanity . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is on the floor, holding his hands on his chest, but he doesn't know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, as a priest, he should speak the words of prayer, and at the same time he can let the soul get liberated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he is now completely ignorant of any prayers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do!?" Su Ge hugged his soul and was stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the gray soul seems to be a bit violent because he can't hear the prayer, and he is constantly struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
