			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the hillside, Sug and Sapir walked side by side with Horace, although he only brought Alger alone, but his identity is here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, Joel looked gloomy at Su Ge, with a smirk in his eyes: "The bishop of the Church of the Holy Blood has a collusion with the female warlock. Things to find a suitable opportunity to spread out, I see how you should end!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When hundreds of people are going up the mountain, there are countless pairs of eyes This team, there are other secret organizations, there are many speculators who plan to profit, and there are conspirators who plan conspiracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these Su Ge don't care, he believes in the judgment and strength of Gerlos and Randall, these things can be easily done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, the group has already followed the mountain road and has arrived about two hundred meters away from the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The close-up view makes the city even more majestic. The walls that are built between the cliffs and the peaks are 15 meters high. The thick gray walls are like mountains. As stable and sturdy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two gates of the city gate have been opened, and through the huge gates of about ten meters high and fifteen meters wide, you can see the neat houses on both sides of the city. , wide streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the street, there are a lot of monsters standing at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God! What is this ghost thing!?" Many mysterious people saw this scene for the first time, and their eyes shouted loudly. The vision has also grown a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there are many humanoid monsters on the streets inside the gate like a zombie wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These monsters are tattered and dressed in very common linen clothes and should look like residents of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a lot of disgusting tentacles on these inhabitants, and their heads were severely deformed and turned into something like a stone. They were armed with various weapons in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including axe, fork, kitchen knife, stick, sickle, torch, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They piled up with each other and looked at least a hundred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sapir saw this turn and asked Su Ge: "This is what you saw yesterday?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge shook his head: "It's not a monster. If those monsters are crazy descendants yesterday, today's monsters should be called mutant villagers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hearing this title, Horace took out a pure silver scorpio and said: "This title is very precise. These people are estimated to be villagers in this city. They are subject to special radiation variations. It is time. The treatment was purified."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, a white ball of light appeared on the upper end of the Scorpio, and the other side was a dark ball of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a four-level secret treasure: Replacement of the Scorpio!" The mysterious person who knew the goods looked surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Replacement is a special secret, and no one knows the origin. The main effect is to reduce and increase the equivalent of certain substances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only has the effect of hurting the enemy, but also the effect of increasing the friendship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only seeing his hand wave, a little man of his own appearance, placed on a white ball of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side, sixty people from the three churches appeared on the black ball of light, and suddenly the sky began to tilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Horace flicked his fingers twice and used a hypnotism for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Su Ge felt his psionics suddenly increase by 20%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychologically suggesting yourself through hypnotism can unlock some spiritual constraints and explode more potential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the moment when Grasse was hypnotized, by replacing the effect of Scorpio, the psionic power of the sixty mysterious people at the other end increased by 20 at the same time. %! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the increase in equivalence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, such a strong group gain is not a small price. At this time, Horace paled and sighed with relief: "For the time being, let me give you a break." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are some wolverines, no one dares to look down on this master hypnotist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it adds so powerful gain to sixty people at the same time, it is already incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the villagers of the mutated inside have discovered the crowd, and then burst into a frantic cry in their mouths, rushing with the broken weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sapir does not know where to take a pair of small hammers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two small hammer handles are less than one meter long. The hammerhead is a silver-gray sphere with a large number of runes on top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two small hammers suddenly collided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;刺刺刺刺刺......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A horrible current is like two touches of high voltage The wires generally broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, do not know where the current comes from, directly rushed the three variants of the villagers directly banging the whole body, black and fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The goddess of the people! It’s time to show the glory of the goddess, purify these heretics!" Sapir yelled, and the two hammers stepped forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following four weeks of hunting demon, sinners, exorcise nuns, etc. all took out their weapons and rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, gunshots, shouts, prayers, current sounds, explosions, one after another, endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three churches took the lead, and other organizations such as the Glorious Church and the Fortress were also followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge was calmly standing with the two bishops, and did not mean to go up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does Sotos not intend to show his skills?" Sapir asked faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge casually said: "This is not a performance competition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sapir eyes Flashed a trace of anger, whispered: "You need to understand that this city's spoils are based on who contributed more who has the right to control. If you do not intend to contribute now, then do not blame us." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled nodly: "Reassure, I am very disciplined."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "哼!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just finished, there was a scream in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original priest was dodging, and the villagers who were mutated were entangled in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see that the tentacle has a very terrifying corrosive power, and the gods instantly become dark and dark, and the binoculars become scary and become crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" Sapir snorted and his body rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hammer of the right hand then slammed down and killed the infected sergeant directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sighed: "It’s a pity, there is actually hope of salvation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we didn't have time to save. One minute and one second on the battlefield is very valuable." Horace said with a hint of education. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The variability of the villagers is not strong, except for the infection and madness, there is no special ability, the physical activity is slightly higher than the average person, the weakness is still Head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who brought this time are all elite, and the clerics in front of them quickly pull the distance after they have figured out the details, take out the firearms, smash the arrows, and use special ones. Hunting bullets and arrows for long-range shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten minutes later, with one person dying and three people injured, the coalition forces all the mutated villagers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You come over and pack these bodies away!" At this time, Sapir said to the scattered mysteries who followed in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of returnees heard a hesitation and were unmoved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sapir went one step forward and flashed a horrible current: "Take me if you don't work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the church members around us quickly gathered around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious people suddenly had some fear on their faces, and they didn’t want to leave when they looked at each other, so they took out the rope tools and towed the bodies on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Sapir snorted and ordered: "It's just that, simply prepare it and enter the city."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Su Ge looked into the empty streets inside through the city gate and fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger came over and whispered, "Bishop, don't you go in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go in, There are so many cannons to protect, now do not enter, but when?" Su Ge said to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger Gray’s eyes turned slightly and whispered: “Bishop, because of my experience, my eyes can see something that others can’t see. Something. I saw a lot of black blood in the city, with a feeling that made me feel familiar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!?" What do you feel? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Similar things that pollute my spirit and drive my will." Said Alger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart was clear, turning to look at the neat and clean streets and asking: “Where are the bloodstains? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger's face is dignified: "There are everywhere, on the streets, on the houses, on the windows..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge patted him on the shoulder: "Very good, you will go back to help Hills, and there will be battles there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Al Jay didn't say much, and turned slightly and then quickly turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did he do?" Sapir asked with a frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly said: "I just found the trail of the cold-hearted church, I let him go and see."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cold Church..." Sapir's eyes flashed a little cold, but did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not very good, Bishop Sotos is not alone now, can't you say this?" Helass yin and yang asked . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "I am enough, you should be careful next. The monster I met yesterday did not appear." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I now wonder if there is such a monster you said here!" Sapir turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heras smiled: "I am going to prepare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instantly There is only one person left by Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am telling the truth, why don't you believe it?" Su Ge had some helplessness to spread his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Serena came over silently: "The captain asks, do you have anything I need to convey?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded slightly, whispering in her ear about her discovery yesterday, and just the discovery of Alger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't focus on the monsters, your goal is to stalk the hunter, try to stay behind, so you can take care of the big picture."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serena widened her eyes after listening, then immediately nodded and turned quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned his head and looked at the elf sect in the distance wearing a light green robes and about 20 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
