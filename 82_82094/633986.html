			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Su Ge did not even have any desire to continue to entangle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mage encounters a wall with a black king's stick and a fart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s body is constantly retreating and ready to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you going?" The voice of Sini’s indifference came, the left hand suddenly slammed, and countless purple radiances erupted, seemingly to form a special field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the crucial moment, Su Ge suddenly raised his right hand, and a burst of light broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Useless, all mystery is the gift of the Purple Moon goddess, now the goddess is about to withdraw the gift to you!" Father Cagnes said, the body suddenly The moment rushed to capture the neck of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't run now," Father Sini said indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said: "Sorry, I have already ran."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell Su Ge suddenly burst like an illusion, leaving only a jealous soul pinched in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!?" Father Sini was slightly enlarged and looked around, only to find that Su Ge had no shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Father Sini does not have anger, but reveals some abnormal smile: "The sorcerer, Suger Sotos. One day, I will put your body under the statue of the goddess of purple moon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark night sky, Su Ge is flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, is the real flight with the cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that this flight is very consuming, and if it’s not the precise control of the cloak through the Holy Grail, Sog’s now only 40% of the spirit Yes, I have already crashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the state is not good, but he did not go directly to the home, but quietly went to the west of the city, a relatively remote manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Adeline’s intelligence, it is now Amelia’s forbidden place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was placed under house arrest and prohibited from contacting any outsider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estate is small in size and looks ordinary and plain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding walls are about two meters high and are made of red brick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a relatively old three-storey apartment in the yard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time all the lights in the apartment are closed, only the study in the east corner of the second floor is lit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹲In the corner, Su Ge released the night bell and looked at the entire building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are a total of twelve clergymen, both on the periphery and on the first floor. There are four ordinary people, they should be servants. There are not too many clergymen. It was only a simple house arrest, and for some reason, the church was very certain that Emilia would not leave. Otherwise, this waste could not stop her."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the general situation was determined, Su Ge did not act rashly, releasing a more detailed night clock to detect the mysterious circle in the entire yard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are a lot of alarm circles around the walls, and the house and the inner courtyard are not there. It seems that they have to fly in." After the situation was completely determined, Su Ge passed The Holy Grail of the Soul has simply armed itself to ensure that it does not produce a psionic scent. After the body is like a vampire, it turns over the wall by moonlight and shadow, and stands silently at the top of the house. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night bell re-explored, Su Ge quietly climbed into the window of the old attic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dusty attic, the shock caused by the impact of the shoes and the floor was easily disposed of by Su Ge, leaving no footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reaching out the door of the house, the knowledge of the slight vibration is passed in, and the lock core inside is broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a downward wooden staircase outside the door, which is estimated to produce a harsh squeeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, these are not a problem for Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going down the stairs is an east-west corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the gallery was dark and there was no one on the third floor. According to Su Ge, there was a lot of useless furniture and artwork in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the third floor is used as a warehouse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge Passing through the corridor and coming down the stairs to the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lights on the second floor corridor are still open. At this time, two clergymen came up from the stairs on the first floor and came to this side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his hand, his radiance flashed, and with his own mastery of illusion, he gave a cognition to two professional-level clergymen. obstacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In their eyes, Su Ge is a fly that flies in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When two people passed by, Su Ge’s body was stuck on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of two people, a fly squats on the wall at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess staff raised their hands to fight, just when her hand was less than ten centimeters away from Su Ge’s face, the male cleric on the side said, “Okay. The Archbishop likes to be quiet, don't quarrel with her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess muttered: "What archbishop, she is nothing now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, put away your hands and continue to patrol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t really become a fly, it’s just a cognitive impairment for two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the slap of the female cleric is really on his face, then he can only make two people physically lose their memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a round of round-trip patrols of two clerics, they returned to the first floor along the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger released the evening bell Yu Bo looked, the four maids slept at the western side of the house at this time, and Emilia’s study was located at the most East side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the corridor, Su Ge looked at the wallpapers and façades that were full of chronology, all of which were theological aspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before going silently to Emilia’s study, Su Ge can see that Emilia is sitting in a chair and writing down through the aftermath of the evening clock. What is it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four bookshelves in the study that slow down all kinds of books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took a deep breath, reached over the doorknob and pushed the door straight in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No need for coffee, you can sleep first." Feeling that the door was opened, Emilia did not look up and said while writing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice is still so ethereal, the voice with a shallow nasal sound, full of fairy and a kind of cute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Emilia was wearing a loose beige pajamas, silvery white hair scattered behind her back, a few strands of hair hanging down her chest. The clean and beautiful face is full of serious look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful hand holds a pen and writes something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serious, focused, mature, beautiful. This is the four words Su Ge can think of at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year and a half did not leave any traces on Emilia's body, she did not increase, the appearance is still beautiful, the skin is still delicate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the temperament of the whole person becomes more restrained at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she used to be a domineering woman, at this moment she is more like a female writer who is retired and mature. With a quiet and elegant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
