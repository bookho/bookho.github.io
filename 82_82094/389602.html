			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whole world, because of Guinness’s situation, people’s enthusiasm, people are paying attention to Emilia’s powerful ability, and gradually noticed this A young man named Sog Sotos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop, who is only 25 years old, has not been in the past few years, but the number can be counted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the control of Emilia, the church only disclosed the message of Su Ge, and even the mysterious profession of Su Ge as a priest was not made public. Not to mention the portrait and mysterious level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guinness Kingdom at the heart of the storm is now welcoming the new storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The involvement of the Church of the Holy Blood, because of the civil war in the country. More hidden guys in the dark are ready to nail their own nails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything outside the world has nothing to do with Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time he is following Emilia to learn the necessary knowledge and corresponding identity posture as a bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days ago, in this palace, under the auspices of Emilia and five other bishops, Su Ge was baptized and became a The official bishop of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Su Ge to become a bishop, there were many other objections at the beginning, but then Emilia was pressured by the powerful merits of Su Ge. Go on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baptism of the bishop is very simple. Under the special care of Emilia, the others did not see the strange tattoo on the body of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, Su Ge is a bell-bearer, a sword she hides in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only secret law profession passed down by God, Emilia clearly knows the horrible growth space of Su Ge's future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Vanas and many other aristocratic witnesses, Emilia gave Sug’s robes, identity tokens, goddess’ pendants, and Relevant identification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came here, the three parties got satisfactory results at the same time and they were very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second day after the ceremony, Su Ge, who was already able to walk normally, began to follow Emilia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This study takes a month, Emilia takes Su Ge to learn and practice, and more church ships fly over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These ships are shipped with ready-made, ready-to-assemble building parts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge parts of the body include the walls of the church, the floor tiles, and even the special soil used for the foundation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out, the Church of the Holy Blood has already had a mature system for building churches, which can mass produce materials for the assembly of the Church of the Holy Blood. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the size of the Church of the Holy Blood is only one-third the size of Bain City due to time, and the rest will be in the days that follow. Continue to add. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one third of the area is also huge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of the church was discussed by Vanas and the nobility. Coincidentally, the location was just the former manor of the mountain range, due to the lack of space. At the same time, the territory of the five nobles in the vicinity was also expropriated, and of course, sufficient compensation was given. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everything is determined, under the operation of the Church of the Holy Blood, the unnecessary roads, rockeries, and flowers will be flattened. At the same time, the original castle of the Duke of the Mountain Range was completely renovated. Based on this, the walls were dark red and the top was sharply pointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut the original spire of the Castle of the Dukes of the Mountains to the next level as the other part of the future church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Church of the Holy Blood was built in front of the original castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of the Church of the Holy Blood came to almost 500 people. The rest were hired by Guinness engineers and laborers. Almost two thousand people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, the entire city was full of fun, and people talked more about the magnificent church almost one day after a meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom people who have just been affected by the disaster are happy to smile and travel through the inner and outer cities every day. The Holy Blood Church gives a very generous salary, which is for them. It is very important to say that it makes them very energetic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a room outside the fire, in a room in the palace, Emilia and Su Ge sit opposite each other, and the table between the two is neatly placed. Four books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These four books are big and small, thin and thick, but uniform gives people a retro texture, like the treasures of the years, full of time to precipitate The charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four books in front of this are real secrets, which contain a large number of unknown ancient secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first book is entitled "The Apocalypse of the Mist", which mainly records the secrets of some gods in ancient times, that is, in this book, Su Ge I saw the clockman of the Hades and the cold king who was inexplicably similar to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second book is called "The Byron Chronicles". The author of this book is legendary as an undead. It is rumored that he existed from the time when ancient times did not break. Witnessed countless history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Byron rumor in the book is the first human emperor to unify human beings and the first mysterious person of all mankind. Legend has it that his knowledge is Related to dreams, also known as the god of dreams, is a god that children love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital of the Bertrand Empire is now named after Byron the Great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Byron chronicle, most of the text is hidden and can’t be seen. Only the vague message can be seen. The detailed content is almost the same. Ten thousand years ago, the first dynasty of the Middle Ages began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third book is called "Three Nights Before Creation", a book that records the creation of the goddess in March, in which Sug saw the goddess of March. The real title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess of the moon, symbolizing purity and fertility, is called a pure splitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess of blood and moon, which dominates the primitive and blood, is known as the Burner of Dominance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess of purple moon that governs science and mystery is called the interceptor of advice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book details in detail how the three goddesses created the world in three nights, similar to the creation of God in the Bible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in it, Su Ge noticed some special circumstances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s said: The March goddess killed seven ancient demons who enslaved humans on the ground and imprisoned their bodies forever in the ground, building a maze to stop People are in contact with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it is said that in order to protect the world, the goddess of March fought against the horrible gods and completely expelled and sealed them so that people can live happily. Go on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last book is called "The Sea of ​​Knowledge: Cabatos." The core of this book is the source of the three great churches, known as the mysterious source of humanity, and some things at Kabatos College. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some theoretical things, as well as interactive discussions and dialogues between teachers and students, some of which are similar to the Analects of the Earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it is also recorded in many ancient means of acquiring knowledge in ancient times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways to make Suge look chilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is praying to open the door to the stars, a group of students linking their brains to the great will of the starry sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final result Su Ge did not know what it was, but the group of students all died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is a bit disgusting. Some people have come to the theory that human beings can’t see the truth of knowledge. It’s not enough vision. We have a higher level of vision. To increase your own eyes, awaken the invisible "intracranial shackles" and pray for a glimpse of the truth of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the students who performed this method eventually disappeared, as if they had never appeared before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also many other creepy methods, including the use of human brains to increase wisdom, drinking human blood every day is eager to increase vitality, taking Mithril and Mercury to increase their mysterious affinity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this book, Su Ge has fully realized the primitive era in which all things are ignorant and ignorant, and humans are obsessed with the madness of knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the book, the Academy of Cabatos seems to have undergone tremendous changes, and the entire college suddenly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the three students who are free from the outside of the college, intelligent and wise, and firmly established, each set up three organizations that guide humanity, that is, today’s March church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many contents in these four books. Su Ge has finished reading it in two days. The two people have just finished discussing the content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please don't laugh at the ignorance and cruelty of the ancestors, they have made great contributions to the development of humanity as a whole." Emilia said with admiration . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge followed his nod, thinking of the students of Kabatos, and suddenly thought of the original Ron and the three brothers of the recent Duke of the Mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two groups are doing things similar to those who were eating people, the similar ideas of the holders, in Su Ge’s view, they have nothing. the difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, Su Ge’s heart jumped and did not dare to continue thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you feel about the ancient mysterious cold king and the clockman? Is there any special connection?" Emilia asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge returned to God and licked his chest and said: "There was some special incitement when I saw it, and a faint familiarity appeared in my heart. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia expressed understanding: "The secret profession is a rare special occupation. This kind of career is very special and cannot be carried through conventional carriers. Learning to get it can be said to be an adventure on luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Emilia asked: "Do you know why the secret profession is stronger than the ordinary profession? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
