			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having two cups of coffee to sit down, someone will come over soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the object of conversation is not Su Ge, but Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Du Fu (Roland), you haven’t been here for a while." The person who came was a shirt in his shirt, a young man in his thirties. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded slightly: "Well, I’ve been a little busy lately, and I’ve got a big guy on it, and we’ve got a lot of things for us.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man laughed and turned to look at Su Ge: "This is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my friend, Just returned from the field," Roland said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge extended his hand and smiled: "You can call me a clockman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young man looked at Su Ge: "It’s good to call me a fox."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the chill, the fox joked and asked: "The people are really interesting now, from the field. Come back collectively. You see so many people today, they all said that they have just returned from the field."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked around, hehe smiled: "Coincidence "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland whispered here: "Have you heard any recent noises? I feel a little wrong."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fox looked around and whispered, "Of course, and it’s still a big wind. I heard that many big people have come."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge swept around his eyes and found that most of the people here were professional mysteries and even apprentices. As for the expert level, they could not see it at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are some ways to say it." Roland whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fox’s eyeball turned: “I want to say no problem, old rules.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded slightly: "Reassured, I will inform you in advance of the next church action."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fox seems to be very convinced of Roland, whispered: "In There seems to be some situation in the north."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? What is the situation, make it clear." Roland asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fox took a sip of tea, his eyes carefully sweeping the sides, and the sound pressure was lower: "I heard that somewhere in the north was horrified." The vision has shrouded, and a country has been shrouded in. The first organization to get intelligence has sent two groups of mysterious people, all led by the masters, and they have never returned. There is no news. Now it is said that it is related to the Holy Grail. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland listened to his heart and turned to look at Su Ge, who was drinking coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge casually said: "What are they doing here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who knows! The fox spread his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't want to talk to the stranger, this guy had a sense of oppression that made him feel uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the door next to the counter on the right side opened, and a woman dressed in a dark blue slim suit and a heroic look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women look tall and one meter tall, sexy and hot, brown short hair combed neatly, fair-skinned, with a tear in the corner of his eyes, looks mature and sexy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the women came out, they immediately attracted the attention of all the men in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fox whispered: "This beauty seems to be a big man. After coming yesterday, he went directly into the advanced area. I don't know which church person, It always gives a sense of policemanship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge also looked at her with interest, and the woman seemed to notice the realization of Su Ge, a pair of dark green The eyes and Su Ge are instantly opposite each other, and then a burst of indifference and disgust emerges in their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she followed the steps and came to this side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know!?" Roland saw this embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s innocent waving hand: “I don’t know.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the leather shoes hitting the floor echoed in the hall. Under the gaze of the people, the woman came to the side of Su Ge and asked: "The cancer, you have come here." What is the purpose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman's voice is not good, very cold and hard, like the chilly ice in the winter, full of edges and corners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are called a cancer!?" The fox glimpsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland white gave Sug a look, meaning: "I still say you don't know!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge’s innocence at this moment, politely stood up and said: “Beautiful lady, are you confessing to the wrong person? I am not a cancer, you can call me a clockman.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman is unmoved and continues to say: "You better give me the truth, or I will solve you now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge brows slightly wrinkled, gradually straightens his body, and said with dissatisfaction: "Do you admit the wrong person? Don't be so inexplicable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Although the woman is good, Su Ge does not have any affection for her, and even has an indescribable disgust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the door opens again, followed by two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young man with the same style as a woman, one is a middle-aged man in a dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Serena, not rude." The youth walked over and yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman snorted and retired behind the youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man hurriedly apologized and apologized: "This gentleman, I am sorry, I am in trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he approached, Su Ge could clearly feel the eccentric shock in the eyes of the youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge puts his hand on his hand: "Nothing, manage your affairs, don't confuse people, or it will easily cause trouble."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man opened his mouth, but he stopped talking and didn’t know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the middle-aged man is on the side, and said: "This gentleman, are interested in going inside to see it? You should have this ability." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at the middle-aged man and smiled a little: "For your organization to admire for a long time, if you have a chance today, then take a look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Su Ge turned and whispered a few words to Roland, and walked inside with the gaze of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this door, there is a corridor like a hotel house, moving along the corridor, the group came to a relatively small, but more refined Luxurious hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no different from a normal cafe, but the people sitting here are generally expert mysteries, about twenty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man respectfully said: "I am the person in charge of this division. You can call my shopkeeper. You are invited to come in mainly because these two gentlemen And the lady wants to talk to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talk to me!?" Su Ge brows and looks at the two people: "We don't know." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, we don't know. But we feel a special atmosphere in you, which makes us very concerned." Youth polite Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the breath?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The smell of cancer." The woman said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug directly ignores her, and her tone is very cold: "I have a good temper, but my patience is limited. If I continue to engage in this inexplicable thing, I will be very Not happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said, the cane slightly lifted and slammed on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A heavy voice accompanied by a bit of cold wind, blowing around with Su Ge as the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone who feels the cold wind gathers his eyes on Su Ge for a moment, some people are shocked, some people despise, some people are interested, Some people are hostile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man has some bad attitudes and hurriedly said: "Sir, please don't misunderstand, we are not hostile."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman is full of hostility in the look of Su Ge, and seems to be ready to shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth also hurriedly said: "We really have no hostility. Can you give us five minutes? I will give you a satisfactory answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg heard this slight nod: "There are four minutes and fifty seconds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, The young man smiled and invited Su Ge into a box. He said: "First let me introduce it. My name is Moore Benson. It is the captain of the law enforcement who is not a fortress. This is the Serena Buddha. It’s my deputy captain.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Not a fortress!?” I heard this Su Ge had some accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fortress is a very long-established organization. They were rumored to be witnesses to the ancient gods before the Four Dynasties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are outside of all the churches, and the headquarters is now the number one secret in the world: the city of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a suspended fortress that has been floating in the sky for tens of thousands of years, and its existence is also the source of the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The status of the Fortress is relatively high, they can be understood as a group of self-contained, international police recognized by major countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no prejudice there and can accommodate anyone. Their mission is to protect the order of the entire mysterious world, to kill everything that threatens the mysterious world in the cradle, or to quickly calm down what has happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
