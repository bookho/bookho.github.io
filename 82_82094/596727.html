			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard this suggestion from Su Ge, Duketon was in a hurry. He now doesn’t want to touch this ghost thing anymore, let alone take it with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Black Mist, you... What does this mean?" Duke asked calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg calmly waved and said: "Reassured, I will deal with the mysterious treatment of the statue, to ensure that you will never let you get any dangerous atmosphere, guarantee Your absolute safety. Now, it depends on how much you trust me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dow heard this, Duke was deeply pondered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two bodyguards on the side are staring at Su Ge with a bad attitude, whispering: "You better not to get an inch. If you dare to hurt our owner, we will "Catch you to the ends of the earth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at the two bodyguards slightly and said to Duke: "Your bodyguard is very loyal, but not Too much knows how to be awe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Su Ge raised his right hand with gloves and made another finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisp finger sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, Duke’s eyes widened, and his face looked incredulously in front of the scene, and fell into deep horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under his gaze, the two incomparably loyal bodyguards suddenly stood still and stood still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s calm voice sounded: “Your Majesty.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two very simply squatted on the sturdy and smooth floor without any resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...this... is this mystery?" Duke asked palely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly and smiled and asked, "Don't you feel a little weird? No one knows how we are."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing this, Duke was filled with shock and bowed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because just now, his vision has risen a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge casually said: "I have no other purpose, just want to tell you, I have no motivation to harm you. Even after arriving at Hui Yao City, we There are also many aspects of cooperation that can be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Duke raised his head again and looked at Su Ge’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a pair of incomparably dark and clear eyes, like the legendary black pearl, deep and full of elegance and noble, without giving a hint of deception and inferior feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing these eyes, Duke took a deep breath and said, "Well, businessmen will inevitably encounter some investment risks. Now, I will take me. Investing in you. I hope that in the future, you and I can all earn the value we expect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stood up and said, "I believe this will It was a pleasant cooperation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke reached out and showed a smile: "Me too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The next time, Sug took the statue of Cthulhu and let Duke leave with his own people. He was going to apply a seal on the statue while applying some interesting traps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two hours later, Sug wiped the forehead of the sea and handed Duke to the statue with no change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke looked at the statue with some hesitation, and took it in a second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While holding it in his hand, he faintly felt that the statue seemed to have changed a lot, and the strange temperament of the previous one has completely disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the time comes, someone will find you asking you for this statue, don't have any resistance, don't call, etc., directly to him, Give the rest to me." Su Ge snarled casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke immediately nod after listening and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's see you in the evening," said Su Ge, with Shelly ready to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Black Mist, my bodyguard!" Duke said quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg looked back at the two bodyguards who were still sluggish, raised their left hand and made a finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With one bang, the two bodyguards instantly recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master? What happened?" Two people hurriedly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke saw this as a ghostly means, filled with awe and shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, you two will now house the butler." Duke said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two bodyguards did not think much, obey the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving Duke’s room, two people walked in the hallway of the cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that the riots in the cabin have subsided, and it seems that the problem in the morning has been resolved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time the ship’s broadcast came with the voice of Marchi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today is the fourth day of our voyage. At 7 o'clock this evening, we will hold a masked social evening party for our Saloni ocean liner. I hope everyone can Have fun and have fun. The location is in the Red Hall, I hope everyone can participate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this broadcast, Su Ge can clearly feel himself before and after Everyone else on the left and right is excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this masked evening can be understood as a carnival, where people have dreamed of getting a happy and romantic encounter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even men and women, after hearing this, are excited, hurried back to the room, pick the right clothes, and prepare the ideal makeup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl said: "This masked social evening is the custom of this ocean liner. The purpose is obvious. It is to establish communication opportunities for these insects. Because of this dance, they can attract countless high-ranking people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge looked at the sea and asked: "Although it is a custom, don't you feel that this party has some ulterior motives?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put everyone in a room It’s more like a sacrifice.” Shirley said it was a bit exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She likes sacrifices, especially blood sacrifices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug ignoring her bad taste, calmly said: "At the same time, this scene is also the most suitable place for the accused accused to play, this preparation is simply seamless "!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly looked at Su Ge’s well-thought-out look and said, "You seem to know who this bug is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and nodded: "Well, I already know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl did not ask, she was not interested Go and learn about this little bug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is natural to suppress the communication to the smallest, divide A few of them. Drake and the statues of the coming objects have all done their hands and feet, waiting until the critical moment, destroying the law, and letting the frenzied people return to normal, the whole call will naturally be ruined."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the Son of God is still in his stomach," said Shelly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "Of course, in his stomach, how can he die violently?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Shirley rarely took the initiative to hold Sug's arm and said with satisfaction: "You are more and more appetizing for me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After all, the old wife is old." Su Ge slightly said with a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley’s brow wrinkled the word carefully, but did not refute it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go, we should be ready to dress up." Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley seems to be interested in this: "What mask do you plan to bring?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
