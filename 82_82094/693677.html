			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Appeared, appeared, really appeared." Sok hiding in the dark was a little excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows through his own channels what happened in the ancient city of Ya, although he did not know comprehensively, but he still has this for Suger Sotos. Relatively much understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;especially as a special mysterious talent owned by the witness, he can link a lot of fragmented news with secrets to draw some already covered the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bells came out of the abyss, using the fog as a medium, abandoning all the living, embracing all the souls. The humans are retreating, the Yi people fear, this is the majesty of God. This is the echo of the bell. The purifier of death, the end of life, this is the Lord of the Valley, the king of the abyss, the ruler of all deaths and the Hades."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sok’s mouth reads the ode to the song he once read in a secret, which seems to be more exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only true god of the valley and the abyss, the title of this god is not well known in the mysterious world, and even no one knows it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after he heard the vocabulary in the prayers of the church of the late bell, he was very excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he knows, because he understands the greatness of that true God, the greatness of that true God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very few records in the world about that one, but in a few records, Sok got a lot of shocking secrets through his mysterious knowledge. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the demise of the undead dynasty, such as the end of the gods, and even the horror truth of countless gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this, this true God has played a leading role in the whirlpool of these times, even in many things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sock is an unbelievers, but because he has learned about these experiences, he can be regarded as an admirer of this true God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really love this profession!" Sok was excited and kissed the notebook in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He studied the church for a long time, but he couldn’t understand it anyway. He is very eager to learn about the relationship between the church and the one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, his previous doubts will be answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the square in front of the chapel, a strange blue mist permeates the surroundings, making people look like a feeling that is not very real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yellow robes who are preparing for the attack are not rushing close because they have a faint sense of crisis, or a faint sense of repression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that behind this fog is a symbol of terror that is far beyond them and unimaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives the Huangpao people a hint of vigilance inside, under the cheekbone cheeks, and the abrupt eyes look at the low-level creature in front of this invisible appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is no different from those of the lower-level creatures, but at this time his black robe is constantly drifting, while a lot of pale blue mist is on his robes. Ascending, like countless tentacles and silk, linked with this whole fog, as if the whole fog is his robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The form at this time is the limit of Su Ge's current knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick bells are constantly coming out, the sacred voice is many times stronger than the previous hymns, let the energetic people calm down and let the crazy people Restore peace, let the feared person find himself back, and let the angry person be quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All negative emotions will be removed by this sacred bell, and people will always return to the original form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sound of the bell, the dark feather of death flutters in the fog, like a piece of goose snow, so that the crisis-filled square has a touch of romance. The meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not human." Huang Pao people first saw Suge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The look under the Su Ge mask is very calm and replies: "I am not human, I know very well. Now you need to leave this place, you are not welcome here. This group of outsiders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"External? When we were in this planet, you were still bugs." For the name of the outsider, Huang Pao is strong. A powerful counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of speech is very well-founded. Almost all of the higher-level Yi people exist much longer than human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not silence on this and continued to respond: "Is it an outsider, not a land occupation. We are all born in this world." It is the son of this world and the master of this world. This world is everything for us, the source of our birth. And you are just a group of passers-by, predators, you don’t belong here to Harry Hugo who rolls back to you. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Halihu!?" Hearing that Su Ge mentioned this vocabulary, everyone heard it suddenly, they never heard this local. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Huangpao heard these three words, the face of the cheekbones changed for the first time, and an expression that can be understood as anger appeared in those cheekbones. On the scary eyes staring at Su Ge: "Human, you have to pay a painful price for your ignorance and disrespect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, Huangpao With a slap in the arm, the fluid body came to Su Ge in an instant like a space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Regular attacks can't reach their bodies." Father Sini's voice is weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not speak, responding to him was a pale, burning palm of fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this legendary Son of God, Su Ge did not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instantly taking the shark potion, it will increase the psionic power by three times, and when it is filled, it will directly become the form of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the dark robes, the palm of the burning blue flame directly crossed the two parallel dimensions, and the fluid that stretched out was firmly grasped. palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out! It turns out!" Sok jumped up from the ground when he saw the excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue flame, the unique wing, symbolizes the death of the big cockroach, the bell of the heart, the everything, let him feel that one The deceased god has once again resurrected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect it! The power of the gods can be inherited by a human! Su Ge Sotos! What have you experienced, reaching today? The extent of this?” Sooke’s curiosity about Su Ge has inflated to his own control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is quite different from Sok. After other mysterious people saw it, most of them were in a state of panic and a negative state of growth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is a church member, the face is pale and ignorant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This body, it has already touched the attitude of the gods." leaning on a priest's body, Father Sini is holding his eyes and muttering. Self-speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yellow robe of Su Ge’s grasp of the shot has a strange float: "You really are not human!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔咔...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When speaking, the tentacle burned by the blue flame has a tendency to freeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the progress is a bit slow, this flame can indeed hurt the stars of these stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, the stalking clerics suddenly returned to God, staring at the frozen ice of the yellow robe and the cracks on the ice. They suddenly cheered up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they found that these high-level monsters are not invincible, they can also be hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you can take damage, you can kill it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, everyone’s gaze fell on the broad, so majestic back of Sugna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four wings stretched and fluttered gently, obviously not inhuman, but the clergyman felt so handsome and martial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Father, he... Why did he help us?" asked a relatively young sinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the church, the church is a cultist, a heresy that kills fellow citizens, humiliates the goddess, is the enemy of all clergy, and is the same as those of the Yi people. Contaminated things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini picked up the pipe that fell to the side and put it back in his mouth, calmly saying: "Because he is a good person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can there be good people in the cultists?" The female patrolman did not believe it. Father Cagnes coughed and seemed to be laughing at her theory, with a deep hoarse voice: "The church at night, all of them are just for the church." It is an enemy. For all humans and mysters, even those of you are good people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, everyone is caught In silence, although there are some circumstance, they still understand the meaning of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell you a somewhat cruel reality." Father Sini continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They suddenly raised their ears and looked at Father Sini. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know much about the other, but at least in the face of the Yi and the evil spirits, everyone in the late bell church is trustworthy. To a much greater extent than the church you believe in, the priests you respect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a devastating force, not only the most powerful whitewashing of the church in the late hour, but also the most horrible trust in these churches. The blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the tentacle is enormous, and the sudden harvest earns the hand of Su Ge and returns to his side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Huangpao man looked down at the tentacles he was still frozen, and the expression of his cheekbones showed a weird expression that humans could not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way he looks is not the anger, fear, and the like that humans perceive, which makes it impossible to judge what his heart is thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug does not care about the appearance of this Yi nationality, his attention is on how to deal with these Yi people, and the problems after dealing with these Yi people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly raised his head and looked at the sky, he did not put these Hasta sects in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Su Ge holding the form of death has the ability to break the boundaries of conventional knowledge, even if he is still a master, but with the improvement and evolution of his own form, he has Far beyond the inhuman knowledge and abilities of ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not know whether these Hasta sects have master-level strengths or higher, and these so-called gradations have no meaning in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Su Ge is very clear, these Yi people are not their opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not blind self-confidence, but instinctive suppression. It is as if a person has seen an ant, and the instinct knows that he can pinch it with one finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uplifting the burning flame to the sky, he knows that there is a presence there, sitting on the throne, overlooking it in the high-dimensional world all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rude mortal! Your ugly head underneath!" After discovering that Su Ge looked up to a certain existence, the Huangpao man seemed to suffer a huge provocation. Or humiliation, shouting loudly, the body under the yellow robe suddenly stretched out countless dark tentacles, like a deformed beast monster, to swallow Sug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this situation, how do I feel that it has become a profound lake?" This moment, his form is in other clergy and mystery The eyes of the person have disappeared, and they have become a vast deep lake on one side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the realm of ...." Father Sini knows so much that he can see the problem at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The realm is a kind of existence of detached knowledge, which is the expression of knowledge contact and action rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the Great Lakes displayed by the Huangpao people is a realm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, Su Ge’s current state of death is also a kind of realm, but this state is more advanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of a completely changed form of Huangpao, Su Ge waved, the silver long sword did not know where to appear, was held in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it coincidence? Or is it a fateful encounter? When I wake up this body, it is also in a lake." There is no fear in Su Ge’s eyes, even There is a trace of remembrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That time, he saw the fairy in the lake, saw a lot of ancient secrets, mastered the holy mark of the lake, and possessed the most Strong killer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale hand grasped the hilt, and the four wings of Su Ge were slightly moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of sacred bells rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows what's going on in the blur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the people returned to God, they found that the Huangpao had changed back to the human form, and he was unable to kneel on the ground, looking at Su grid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is at the bottom of his height, as a king is in prison to examine the prison, put a long sword on his neck, and faintly asks: "How do you want to die?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to turn into nothingness, return to the starry sky." Huangpao people sluggish answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge listened, accompanied by a sound of liquid splashing, the sword broke into the neck of the yellow robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, countless dark shadows appear like countless claws in his fluid body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
