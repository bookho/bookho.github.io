			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sug took Hills and Bernice to the farm in the north of the city, the first thing he saw was his familiar Father Anthony and the former Marlene. The nun is evacuating from here with clergy and police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing Sugton, he hurried forward and asked: "Father Anthony, what is going on? How are you gone?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Anthony has a trace of quirky on his face: "I don't know too well. It seems that the masters of Jeros and the Ron Bishop have discussed the results. After the departure of the masters of Gerlos, they ordered We are evacuating from here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard this Su Ge even more puzzled: "What is the reason for the evacuation?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Marlene said on the side: "Things are temporarily paralyzed and cannot disturb the normal rest of the citizens and cause panic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge With a sigh of relief, he smiled and smiled: "Well, yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Suge that determines the existence of ghosts here is not trusting everyone. His current purpose is to hide himself and not let these people see their doubts and problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when you are not sure which people are traitors, Su Ge should try to be as good as possible and not to attract the attention of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evacuation is orderly and there is absolutely no such thing as Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not stay too much here, but went to the farm on the side to see the situation of Ada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distant apartment, Glyman had a coffee and looked satisfied: "The means of that one is really strong, and the trouble is taken overnight." The demon hunters moved away from the capital, and the police and mysterious people left here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Tyran walked in from the door:" The condition of the container is not very good, we have to perform the ceremony as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grieman nodded calmly: "Time is on this evening, everything is ready Ready."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should the night patrols do? There is a troublesome role there." Tyran is very cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grimman just said, but suddenly felt the distortion of the surrounding, illusory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s the female warlock." Griman put down his coffee cup and squeezed his handkerchief in his pocket, his voice full of alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two did not act rashly, quietly standing there and motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tick! Tick! Tick! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of three drops of water rang in the ear, and the smell of mild night scent permeated the tip of the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three water-like drops of water infiltrated from the blurry surroundings, slowly forming a woman's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At four o'clock in the afternoon, the old place will be the final rally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the mouth disappears The four weeks gradually returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tylan whispered, "What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grimman takes a deep breath The tone said: "You must go, or we can't execute it smoothly. I will drag the group of guys, you will be summoned here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teyl Nod: "May my Lord be with you, my brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May my Lord be with you, my brother."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side, Su Ge has come to the farm where Aida is located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the farm was already quite lively, and a lot of dressed tramps came here under the guidance of the patrolman and finally walked into a place similar to a cowshed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg soon saw the busy Ada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Ada’s bright smile was a pious prayer for everyone while taking the tramp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every tramp that was prayed by her showed a peaceful smile on her face, like a soul that was surpassed by Su Ge before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not bother her in the past, just standing in the distance and observing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Apostle, is this woman your fiancee?" Bernice asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s smile shook his head: “No, she is Ada Newton, a tenant who lives in my house. It’s my big sister. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills stared at Ada, her brow furrowed. She felt that this woman seemed a little weird, but she couldn't tell where there was a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do we do next?" Hills did not rashly say his doubts and turned to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked cautiously around: "For the time being, stay here to see what happens and prevent accidents."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of staying here is to protect Ada on the one hand, and on the other hand, Su Ge wants to determine if there are any mysterious characters around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two witches plus two ha, and with their own in-depth knowledge of the sound, there is not much problem in self-protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are..." At the time of the three people's total, an unexpected voice came from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge, who is very sensitive to the sound, feels familiar when he hears it. He turns his head and just sees a luxurious plush coat wearing a gold sandalwood palm. The youth looked at themselves unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth face seems to have hesitation and unhappiness that can never fade, as if others owe him a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's you!" Su Ge is full of surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young man is a wealthy young man who spent a lot of money to buy a second child a few days ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man came very politely to take off his hat and said, "It’s my pleasure to meet you again."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge smiled and took off his hat and said: "Your mood seems to be still not very good today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man sighed: "Well, my Life is full of darkness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the young man looked up at Erha: "But your dog has shown me new fun." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is clear about his obsession, a pity of explanation: "I am sorry, sir. Only Luobo is that I can't give up anyway." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can feel your friendship with it." The young man said with a gloved hand and a smile on his face: "My name is Rand." "Montgomery, is a doctor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and reached out: "Sug Sotos, an intern police detective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So..." Randall just read a syllable, and his throat seemed to be suddenly pinched by something, abruptly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to you?" Su Ge had some surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall’s pale face instantly recovered, shaking his head and smiling: “It’s my greatest honor to see you.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this, Sugerton was flattered: "You are so polite."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall still talked. Suddenly, the ear twitched and seemed to hear something. He apologized and explained: "I suddenly remembered something to deal with, let's have time to talk again."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay!" Su Ge nodded heartily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills looked at Randall, who was gradually far away, whispered: "This young man is full of melancholy and darkness, and it seems that the whole world owes him money. The same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict went on to analyze: "His words and manners show that he is an aristocrat who received aristocratic education from an early age."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked down at his own hand and closed his own whisper and muttered: "In my opinion, he is a very threatening mystery." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
