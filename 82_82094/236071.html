			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at everyone, his attitude was very calm, slightly raised his hand to signal everyone to calm down, explained: "We are late church for power, money, believers The quantity doesn't care, our goal is only to eliminate those dangerous existences. Because of this, we have a small number and there is no regular clergy. One reason for refusing is here. We don't have enough people to do it for you. Protection. If you rashly accept the believer without giving protection, it will make my god's gods dusty. This is a major sin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people listened and looked up Looking at these people, there are five people who belong to the church of the late bell with a mask. The number is really very rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second point: We are not a registered church, which means that although we have done a lot of good things, we are still unrecognized cults in law. If you rush to join and preach, Ken may be judged as a cultist. You should be clear about the punishment of the cult in March."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I heard this, everyone’s heart trembled, and the spirit gradually calmed down from that enthusiasm, and I was afraid after a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded in satisfaction and continued: "As for the last point, our church is always in contact with the mysterious church. Our main task at this stage is to eliminate those threats. Major events in the world, and this situation is bound to offend many cult gangs. Some of them already know our name and intend to retaliate. If you join, you are likely to be implicated, so for your safety, we are now I can only refuse your request."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone heard this, and I was very grateful for the face. I was grateful to Yulin’s body: "Thank you! Thank you, Pope. His reminder is not the embodiment of the gods. This kind of wisdom, this kindness is really great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behind Hills and Bernice Looking at the back of Su Ge with a look of adoration, this perfect reason they just couldn’t think of it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline looked at Su Ge’s back and thought back a few months ago, just meeting the young, very cautious and youthful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to God, Aidelin sighed: "It’s still young, a change in a few months."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke stood with Clausen at this moment and turned his head and whispered: "If you don't see it, this is a natural god stick."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crow Sen deeply agreed to nod and said: "Really, this tone, this tone, that sad and sorrowful eyes, is in place than many old priests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "How, are you interested in joining in?" Luke whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clawson shook his head and said, "This is not the case. I am not planning to join any organization for the time being. I will leave the cold church after this incident. Walk around, look at the world today, and feel the new world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luke did not stay after listening, patted his shoulder and stopped talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, Su Ge continues his sincere and sincere speech. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the same time, I also hope that everyone here can temporarily help us keep confidential, at least we must not pass our existence and name before applying to become a formal church. Go out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone nods and agrees at the same time. With your current status, there are so many enemies, who wants to pass this name out of trouble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After solving the ordinary person, Su Ge looked at the clerics on the side and sighed: "I hope you can understand our difficulties and help us keep it secret. I believe that I am the Lord." I will also feel happy for your silence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the last sentence of Su Ge, all the clergy’s heart slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a living god, a god who can come here anytime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t dare to touch the existence of this kind of mold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope is relieved! Rest assured! We swear by the March goddess, absolutely confidential! Absolutely confidential!" Everyone looks at the right color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded with satisfaction: "That's best, then what should you do next!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you finish, walk into the Holy Blood Library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the door, Father Waterer smiled and nodded to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is very polite and walks: "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Smiled and made a hoarse voice: "Yes, go see those little guys!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded, took people away Entering the gate, I saw ten "wild people" tied to the pillars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are messy, wearing dirty and worn clothes, and their bodies are very skinny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see that four of the ten people are women and six are men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all can’t look like it, and the messy long hair wraps their head like a chicken coop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Luke, do you have anything to say?" Su Ge did not approach, first asked Luke's suggestion. Luke whispered, "I have talked to them all, and they are very willing to join the church in the late bell. This means that he has taken them from chaos." The awakening of grace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly and turned to look at the crowd and asked: "If you don't mind the church's current size, the church welcomes you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten people seem to have already known about Sugg from Luke and communicated with each other." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Su Ge said, ten people nodded at the same time, and the woman on the far right gave a hoarse voice saying: "We are willing to join and die to greatness." And the Lord of the Storm offers a lifetime of faith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others followed and nodded and said, "We are willing to join!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded: "Mr. Rogan, let them go, I will take them away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan did not stop, whispered "I hope you can take care of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, the witch and the vampire I can take care of, not to mention humans." Su Ge looked confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogen smiled and took out the key to open the lock on the ten people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After everything was arranged here, Su Ge with ten dungeons and Luke, Viginia and others disappeared in the city under the watchful eyes of everyone. In the ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All is over, and the rest of the clergy are gathered together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan, Marx, Bobby, Hank, Anthony, Marlene, Harden, Ivan and other relatively core personnel discuss each other's actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first thing to ask for help from the capital, to inform the highest level of the blood level." Rogan whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony’s dignified warning: “No one can divulge this thing. We can see the power of that one. The consequences of the leak, I believe everyone knows. That is the existence of the authority to die, and it may be more horrible than death to wait for us to wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people listened to the face with a very dignified nod, Express understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the remaining dozen or so ordinary clergy came over and said together: "We are ready to leave the church."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this decision, everyone does not feel an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faced with such a huge thing, ordinary people do not have the firm mind of a clergyman, and withdrawal is a natural choice. Father Hank said with a pleading on his face: "Yes, but now that the manpower is scarce, let's stick to it. After the support of the church is reached, you guys." Can you leave at any time, can you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
