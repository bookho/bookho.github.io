			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Ge returned to the Holy Blood Square, Ada was still strolling outside and did not return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on the edge of the crowd, watching people twirling in the square, screaming people, Sug’s mouth reveals a smile: "Seeing in such a world Such a lively carnival really makes people feel warm, and the tight heart can also get a little relaxation and comfort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The atmosphere, standing here does not move, quiet feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Su Ge was a little intoxicated, Jack’s shouts came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug! Su Ge!" Jack gasped and ran over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg’s return to God immediately felt something bad: “What’s wrong?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roland, Roland has just been taken away by Macock!" Jack looked anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug immediately tightened his heart and looked at the bruises on Jack’s face and asked: "They are still hitting you? Are you still taking the police away?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack reluctantly sighed and said: "They said that Roland is unfaithful and has an improper relationship with me. After hitting me, in the name of infidelity We took Roland away and we couldn’t take it anymore.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this Su Ge without any hesitation: “Where did you get there? How did you go?” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack turned and ran and said: "The place where it happened is on the side of the alley. There are too many people here. Their carriages should not stop nearby, if they chase now You should be able to catch up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge immediately ran and ran: "Lead the way! Run!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, the body slammed into the front of Jack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack bit his teeth, spelling the speed of his life, and trying not to be separated by Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people moved quickly against the flow of people. When they got out of the crowded Square of the Holy Blood, Jack shouted: "The other side! It's there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge followed his direction and turned and quickly ran towards the Kaixuan Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a clear direction, Su Ge’s speed has once again increased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This feeling is great!" While running, Su Ge had a feeling of flying at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he knows that this is not a fly, but that his legs have enough power, and each time you force yourself to stay in the air for a little longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge is very fast, almost has reached the speed of eight meters per second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a cold wind, Su Ge quickly rushed across the corner of the street, turned his head and looked at it, just to see a place almost 30 meters away from him. Black four-wheeled carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far from the carriage, the three men are pulling a woman toward the carriage, it is Roland who was taken away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Roland was pale and struggling, trying to resist, but with deep concern in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge changed his tone, tightened his cane and rushed to the big voice: "Let the lady!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the voice of Su Ge, the three men took the lead, tall and thin, and the young man in a gray suit turned his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young man’s face is a little pale, his cheeks are thin, his nose is hooked, and he has a pair of characters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden hair under the hat is a little messy, and the green eyes sparkle with unknown irritability and quirky cravings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, a person who looked very serious at this time was unusually weird and gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man said to the two strong men around him: "Take her up first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Roland was full of hope after seeing Su Ge. He turned to look at the youth and said with a pleading: "Macock, I know that you have a problem. I don't blame you for the previous things. He is me. Friends, he can heal you, don't go on like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock listened to open his mouth, revealing yellow teeth with a trace of quirky The smile said: "Dear Roland, I am very good now, I have no problems, don't resist, hurry up and give me a lovely child!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When the two talked, Su Ge had already rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately two meters from Macock, Su Ge stopped and spit out a hot breath, looking at Makok seriously: "As a gentleman Is it too much to treat my fiancée like this? I have heard from Roland that his fiancé is a courteous and elegant aristocratic descendant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When speaking, Su Ge instantly opened his own vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sud, Su Ge’s heart jumped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this ghost situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Sug saw Macock's The body was enveloped with a weird shadow. The shadow was unclear and the road was unknown. It gave people a kind of depression like a cloudy sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it wasn’t the shadow that made Suger unexpected, but the belly of Markock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the vision that has now come to twenty o'clock, Su Ge blurs to see what is going on in Macock's abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t see the shape of this thing, but the thing that caused the compression of the abdomen during the peristalsis made Suge barely see that it was a prototype. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a thumb size that looks like a magnified thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is constantly wandering around his abdomen, seemingly looking for a breakthrough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this? Parasite? Or the goods that enter the outside world? No, if it is a living thing, it will not leave psionic energy around."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of Su Ge's contemplation, Macock had a large circle of Su Ge, and his eyes finally fell on the worn gray cane of Su Ge's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, his face is proud and his voice is contemptuous: "People are civilians who have no taste. The clothes are so nondescript, it is stupid and inferior." Imitation, it makes people sick. Roll away, you are not qualified to talk to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you finish, turn around and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes blinked. He just thought a lot of countermeasures in his mind. As a result, he didn’t expect to open his mouth directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought I had to go through the procedure. Since you started the spray directly, I wouldn't be polite."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a new generation of people, the good young people who implement the socialist core values, although Su Ge is not an angry youth and hatred, but this self-righteous contempt can be said to be abhorrent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The only thing that can appear in the novel is that the face is about to appear, and there is still a little excitement in my heart." Su Ge sorted his thoughts, and his tone was still full of courtesy. Continue to say: "Please recognize who you are talking to now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said, take out the goddess pendant in his collar:" The Holy Blood Church, the purple moon substitute, Su Ge Sotos now asks you to assist me in the investigation, and immediately let go of Ms. Roland Bowman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperial law In addition to the special territory of a few nobles, the mysterious staff of the church has an extraordinary status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Purple Moon Acting as the March Apostle has the right to enforce law regardless of any title and identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not advisable to spray, it will only make the opposite look even worse. After all, the opposite is a highly educated aristocrat, not like the protagonist in the novel. Just say two words and go crazy. Since you want to press me by your identity, then see if you can hold it down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, I heard Su Ge After the identity of Macock stopped, slowly turned to stare at the goddess necklace in the hands of Su Ge, his face suddenly gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
