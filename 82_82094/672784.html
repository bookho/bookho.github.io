			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the country of God, Su Ge is communicating with Luke after he withdraws from the body of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There seems to be a problem with the Elf Church." Luke said his intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luck is now a bridge between the Church of the Late Bells and other organizations, as well as an agent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lance had planned to preach here, but suddenly received the news and hurried back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suge asks: "What can happen there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke indulged, then asked: "You have heard about the world. At the end of the tower: What is the legend of Mirendrin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly heard the name, Su Ge was surprised, then said: "Know some, the end of the world The tower is located at the border of the world. It is the channel connecting the world in the table and the pillar supporting the heavens and the earth. In the legend, Mirondrin lives in a beautiful fairy, where there is no dispute, no hatred, everything is filled with peace and beauty. It is the most beautiful and happiest place in the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Milon Delin and Byron City, Laleille became the three legends. But two of the cities, Su Ge, have already confirmed that they really exist, so Mirondrin, Su Ge naturally believes that it is real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this related to the Elf Order?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just finished, Su Ge suddenly When he thought of his first encounter with Lance in Guinness, he preached in the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he said at the time was the tower at the end of the world, and the content of Safiro about the ideal township far from the world. (For details, see Chapter 0231. If you forget, you can go to the beginning.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Safiro is Mirondrin!?" Now I want to come, Su Geton was at a loss. Luke nodded: "The other side of the world, away from the ideal world of the world, is the core of the teachings of the Elf Church for many years. The significance of this is for the Elf Order." It’s unusual.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does Mirendine be born?" Su Ge thought of jumping. Luke shook his head, and then said with a positive expression: "According to what I said, they are likely to have a huge trouble this time, and even Crisis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talk about it." Su Ge still has a very good impression of the Elf Order. Luke explained: "According to the records, the tower at the end of the world links the heavens and the earth, is the pillar supporting the world, and is the cornerstone of the stable world. Its form cannot be What ordinary people have seen is that the other side at the end of the world is rooted in the majestic holy city called Safiro. And in the holy city is surrounded by the desert of stars, it can be understood that Safiro is in the stars." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Su Ge suddenly remembered the record in "The Travel of Stars" and said that he was very suspicious of this legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Su Ge did not speak and nodded to him to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The recent world situation is not very stable. The evil spirits that do not belong to this world have signs of recovery, and the astrology has changed."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can you see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke’s eyes are full of squats: "The god you caught before is the most A good proof, the evil spirit who masters the power of dreams, lives in the deep-sea capital Laleille's sleeping god Cthulhu. Anything related to him will have a discourse called "When the stars are in the right position." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge’s heart suddenly had some vigilance and worry. Luke continued: "According to the brief description of Lance, he said that the stars were dusted, and the strange winds blocked the light of the stars, the surrounding of the Holy City." Surrounded by the yellow sand. This represents a sign that a horrible evil god is about to come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are they going to do?" Su Ge asked calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" According to him, the gun of the storm, the Lord of the cloak of the glory has been awakened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Upon hearing this, Su Ge said with amazement: "The rumored story of the storm Lord at the end?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the storm Lord, some people say that he is human Some people say that he is an elf, and some people say that he is a fairy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary He held a storm rifle that could tear the sky, riding a shining white horse, sleeping in the light sacred hall of Mirondrin, sitting at the end On the throne, look at the world with the sky as the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge does not know much about him. After all, whether in mysterious legends or in ordinary legends, does this great existence exist? It is a mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Storm Lord...the power seems to be somewhat similar to me." Su Ge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke is very serious and continues to say: "One thing I think you need to know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the northern archipelago near the Elves, there is a lot of name for this storm Lord. The Storm Lord is only one of them. One, there is the Lord of Light, and... mad hunting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!?" Hearing this Su Ge brows a look, the look is full of surprises . Luke said with respect and respect: "I have done a lot of homework recently and checked a lot of information. According to the custom at the time, hunting is a storm. And the god of the soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not control the soul and the Lord of Light?" Su Ge spit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luke’s face nodded solemnly, seriously: “This will involve the origin of this storm Lord. According to my internal church in the Holy Blood The information obtained, the Holy Lord of the Storm is a demigod."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Half God!? Is there such a statement?" Su Ge asked unexpectedly. Luke explained: "The definition of the demigod is not the level of power, nor the level below the gods. The demigod is similar to the god, it is a kind The direction of human development."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Since this is said in detail, I am not very clear about the several levels after the mystery." Su Ge's thinking is always jumping and diverging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke is a qualified teacher and introducer, with a detailed introduction: "Master, Lord, Dominator, Daxian. This is what you know now." The level is known. Above this level, there are two levels that ordinary people cannot understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first level, we call it immortal Those who enter this level, the body will be assimilated by knowledge, into a special dimension, with an indescribably long life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Immortal? Does it mean immortality?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke nodded: "It can be understood, but there is nothing in the world except the gods. There is nothing too complicated. I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do humans have this level now?" Su Ge asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke silenced and then replied: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really! Su Ge was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke’s dignified sigh: "Those who are human beings are not human. They don’t know how long they have lived, everything in the world." They are not interested, they just want to continue to live. So in order to survive, they will do whatever they want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Luke’s eyes Flashed a burst of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you seen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have seen it once, I will never forget it in my life." Luke’s face was not very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not ask, indicating that he would continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On top of immortality, is one of the end points of our human evolution, turning itself into the form of knowledge: the Great God."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Su Ge’s expression is faintly said: “Is the final form of human being really a great god?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distorted form of the Great God, Su Ge has seen it more than once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind of abandoning the self, the act of becoming a god in knowledge, too crazy and dangerous. With a little carelessness, the will will be completely dissipated like the god of death before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke continues: "Another level similar to the Great God is the half-god achieved by the Lord."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't describe the shape of the demigod. I also saw a few words in the ancient library of the Holy Blood Maze."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Achieving a demigod requires a very long time, and must die once. By removing some impurities from the body by death, and then experiencing the baptism of countless years in an absolutely pure place of knowledge, the body and spirit become one. Infinitely close to the form of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this, Luke sighed: "However, this condition is too harsh, rumors have been since ancient times, Only the Holy One has reached the so-called semi-god form."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge frowned and didn't know what to think about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking here, Luke said: "The Storm Lord has the power of light, but because of its death, and in the long years with many purity The souls meet and guide them, because of this legend, He is endowed with such power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Continue."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fighting is a natural god of nature in its definition. It is itself a condensate of the rules of knowledge of the world. It is extremely powerful. It can even be understood as a system that processes and guides the soul of the whole world. On the ghost island of Kuras, habituality is called the god of death and the owner of the Hades."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nod: "Your analysis and investigation are not Wrong, this is indeed part of the essence of mad hunting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak back to the storm Lord. The Star Desert outside Safiro heard that it was the formation of falling stars. It can reveal some pictures of the future, and even see the fate of certain worlds. It is also the main miracle of the Elf Order. A scene in which the records appear and have been confirmed this time surrounded by sand, certainly indicates some important "<br /> <br /> & nbsp history;.. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
