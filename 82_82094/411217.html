			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cleric who left the office was like looking for a decent job, and the clergyman in service was fed up with the new bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing the words of Su Ge, everyone shouted and agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are some who have not followed, such as Orson and Jack, who are ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people have no influence on Su Ge’s plan, and Su Ge did not say much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the talk, everyone was happy to eat, happy to drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is a companion who has experienced despair and witnessed miracles, just like the comrades who lived together on the battlefield, they still have good feelings with each other, so Eat well, drink it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At eleven o'clock in the evening, the party ended in the middle of the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aftermath of the work was handed over to Griffin and Jean. Su Ge returned to the Church of the Holy Blood to prepare for a break with Erha and Anthony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the warm bath, Su Ge woke up a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drank a lot this evening, this is the first time he has come to the world to drink so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the bath is the dog planer that Erha is free to show, and shows his "superb" swimming skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After showering, Sug wiped his body and slept directly on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Suge slept, the holy grail file that had been placed on the table suddenly trembled, seemingly irritated, and the surface of the cloth began to tremble violently. It seems to be suffering a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a wave of waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An invisible wave of small area spread out to cover Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleeping Su Ge did not enter the body of God, but was in the deepest sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But suddenly he felt a little embarrassed, and there was a whisper in the ear that seemed to be a whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t hear what the voice was saying. He didn’t even know what language it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blur, he opened his eyes and saw several people wearing eccentric armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people couldn’t see it, wearing some weird gray armor, and the gap between them was covered with gray-black cloth, covering the whole body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of a metal helmet with a heptagon, covering the entire head, with a long gun in his hand, or a tomahawk, or even worn out Flintlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger looked around and was surrounded by darkness. Counting himself, a total of seven people gathered around the warm and bright fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people didn’t talk, they looked at the fire in peace and the atmosphere was very peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is this? I have illusion?" Su Ge frowned and did not act rashly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes under the helmet swept around and the eyes tightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these seven people, each person has a large number of corpses behind them. These corpses are human, animal, all kinds of things, everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpse style behind each of the seven individuals is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What other people’s bodies look like is not visible, and there seems to be something obscuring his sight and not letting him see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can only look back at the body behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These corpses have a common feature, and the head bursts open and is covered with bloody organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down at himself, with a bloody and pungent smell on his hand, and a blood-stained hair on his left hand. And the skin of the machete, it seems that the battle has just ended, there is no time to rest the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔蹦! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of firewood bursting sounds loud and harsh in this quiet and stressful environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s gaze was drawn by the crackle. When he looked at the bonfire, his eyes widened and he felt a tingling scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the burning of the fire is not wood, but the human skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the skull, saw the spine bones, saw the hand bones, saw the leg bones...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;A moment of some suffocating pressure on the chest of Su Ge, making him breathe some difficulty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is about to look away from the line of sight, he looks around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire did not shine too far, and the surrounding area was dark and barely visible. There were many tall and dense buildings in the fog, and there were dilapidated old streets and full It is the wall of the traces of the years, and the darkness of the turbulent wandering in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up to the sky, three giant twisted monsters are flying through the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster is extremely twisted and twisted, and the strange form makes it impossible for Su Ge to understand and remember, just like the body of a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s eyes are wide, but he finds that his vision is not mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This should be a dream world, not affected by the system of vision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge I thought about it and wanted to call myself as a dreamer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right here, the sound suddenly sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Time, not much." Suddenly a voice did not know which person's helmet came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, not in time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Need, more sacrifices." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Need, more outsiders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Need, break the rules."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Sug’s body spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Need, son."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, everyone suddenly becomes silent and seems to fall into Some kind of contemplation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hunting, continue. The fire can't be extinguished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After saying seven people stand up, each Leaving from seven different directions and entering the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seven people left, Su Ge found that he did not follow them, he still sat here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just, it’s just that his invisible spirit is sitting on one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the place here?" Su Ge called himself as a god of dreams, but found that there was no effect at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you say...this is not a dream!?" Thinking of this, Su Ge’s spirit shuddered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not a dream, but what other space, then he is in danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just thinking about this, Su Ge only felt the sound of a whistling sound coming, he suddenly turned, the person who had already left did not know when to return The chopper that I just saw was cut directly into my head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not good!" Su Ge's body flickered, but found himself unable to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of crisis, he suddenly flashed a gray light. Wrap him up directly, and in a whirlwind, he suddenly felt himself slamming on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Little guy, you are really big enough, you dare to go in the ancient city?" A voice that was pale and powerless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug lay on the ground, the dark sky can only see the stars, but can't see the moon hanging in the sky all the year round. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is...the dreamland!?" Su Ge suddenly remembered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The reaction is quite fast." The soft light in the night lighted Su Ge's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked up and looked up. He saw a middle-aged man wearing a worn-out dress, wearing a black jazz hat and holding a lantern. Look at yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trace of this middle-aged man’s vicissitudes seems to have lived for many years. His unshaven eyes and his eyes have no pupils, just like a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now has a soft smile and looks at Su Ge with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not feel hostile on him, slowly stood up and said gratefully: "Thank you for your help."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man smiled a little and made a deaf-mute voice that was completely incompatible with his strong body. Q: "Your kid is lucky, just like I have nothing to sleep for a while today. Otherwise, you are now Already dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you! Thank you!" Su Ge thanked him again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking around, Su Ge asked the middle-aged man: "My name is Su Ge Sotos. What do you call it?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sotos!?" The middle-aged man listened to a slight glimpse, then casually said: "The name has been forgotten, you call me the old Weiss." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded after listening: "Good Mr. Weiss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Weiss carefully looked at the spirit of Su Ge and said: "Look at you There should be no knowledge related to dreams. Should it be inhaled into the old dream world of the ancient city because of the contact with the Holy Grail documents?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger heard about it, then a little bit Head, then asked: "What do you mean by the old city and the old dream of the old city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Weiss does not seem to be selling a quick explanation "The ancient city is a special place, and the old dreams, as the name suggests, are some of the dreams that have remained in the past. You have just entered a past, or some residual dreams of ancient existence. That thing is because of the powerful laws of ancient existence. , formed a substantial existence, still remains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this Su Ge’s heart suddenly burst into shock, this is the first time he listened to this kind of thing. Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the ancient city?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Weiss looked up at the moon without the moon, only the stars: "Like this dreamland, it is a legacy of a certain time."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge does not dare to continue to ask, because in this world, the more you know, the faster you go crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Su Ge asked, Old Weiss said: "As you can see, your spirit and psionic power can be said to be very powerful. Otherwise the average person is affected by the Grail documents only. I will be mentally disordered and go crazy, instead of entering the ancient city through the guidance of the Holy Grail documents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "I am really better than normal because of some adventures." More."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only psionics are not enough." Old Weiss said meaningfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s heart glimpsed and looked at the old Weiss’s heart with a hint of awe: “You are also very strong, and you can actually put me in the hands of those horrible beings. Salvation. Should it be at least the mysterious person at the Lord level?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Weiss heard this brow slightly, then laughed and said: "You see It’s really true, I’m the lord. And there’s no fighting power, I can only play tricks in my dreams. But I’m very optimistic about you!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
