			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 11 am, a low-key luxury carriage stopped in front of the apartment at Evan House. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Luther, dressed in a neat suit, hurried down with the professors of the two schools, tidy up his expression, and walked up the stairs with enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neighbors who passed by saw three people dressed in glamorous faces with a strange look on their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the circle that people here can reach, should no one have access to people at this level? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the eccentric gaze of these people, three people stopped at the door of Evan’s house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knocked on the door, the door opened very quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the door is Evan’s father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing Luther, Evan’s father first glimpsed, then hurriedly smiled and ushered the three into the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president of the university has met several times. Today, when he saw the president of the university coming to visit, he immediately thought about what Su Ge said last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Suge really is a leader!" Evan's father sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty and Evan, who were cleaning up the room in the room, were a little shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the shock of Luther’s arrival, but the shocking Suger’s authority today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This speed is so fast that the brothers and sisters are not expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president of the 100-year-old ancient school can be said to be on the move, and from the expression of Luther, it is obvious that it has just been severely Frightened, his face has not fully recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone of speech is full of care and compliment, and the inquiry is with the meaning of temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop! It’s amazing!" the family sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug does not know that Griffin’s mobility is very strong, and the principal has already come to the door to plead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time he and Roland walked side by side in the southeastern city of Bain City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today Roland is wearing a light blue jacket with a white fleece collar and a pair of jeans and flat-bottomed sneakers. The long hair is in the shirt. The head is fixed with a headband, mature and restrained with a refreshing youthful vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The destination of the two is a bar called the Devil, which is one of the entrances to the mysterious circle of Bain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have noticed this place when I was an ordinary policeman, but I have never been able to go in. After I became a mystery, I found some way." They will give some mysterious patterns. These patterns need at least fifteen points to see." On the road, Roland introduced to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg listened slightly and nodded: "What's the situation inside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland hands on The jacket of the jacket casually said: "The basement and the second floor are the gathering place of the mysterious people. The strength is generally in the profession, the experts are relatively rare, and the masters are not. There are most of the guys in the black and white and gray roads. There are even a lot of cult personnel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a very open-minded woman, and she has a very good relationship with Su Ge. She did not take Sug as private. The bishop looked at it and simply regarded it as a friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said: "I can see that you should have no access in the past six months."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Roland smiled and nodded: "Well, instead of church monitoring, getting intelligence is one thing. On the other hand, I want to know more about the mysterious world and get some mysterious materials and equipment that belong to me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the harvest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Getting a lot!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haha! Two people laughed at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! Right! I got some intelligence about Ada." When he passed a corner, Roland suddenly remembered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug, and then calmly asked: "Where did you get it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This, secret!" Roland squinted his left eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge didn’t ask too much, he certainly knew that she knew it from Luke, but it didn’t break. After all, in Roland, Su Ge did not know the existence of her master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quickly talk!" Su Ge asked positively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland said with a mysterious look: "Ada last appeared on the southeast side of the empire, on a small island in the northwest of the Pearl Sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Island?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland said solemnly: "Well, she seems to have performed some rituals. The people there turned into her crazy believers, and finally all melted into a white light and turned into thousands of white bones."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su After listening to the brow, he was slightly wrinkled and fell into meditation without speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, the Glorious Church seems to have found something in Ada, sending people to follow her insanely."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "Understood, thank you for your intelligence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Polite, what our relationship can do I want to help." Roland patted Sug's shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people in the conversation have already arrived at the devil's bar that Roland said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bar is on the first and second floors of a large commercial building with a large area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a dark plaque on the top of the door, with the words "Dream Tavern" written in dark red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it’s daytime, but the bar is not deserted, people come and go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are drunk, and they come out and squat on the steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a man with a wretched face, a drunken woman ran to the hotel next door, and some people were in twos and threes, talking and laughing into the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge opened the vision and swept forward, clearly feeling that there was a significant psionic fluctuation in the entire building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up again to look at the plaque, the devil pub above has suddenly turned into: "The House of Travel Master."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!? It’s really a big guy!" Su Ge said unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland said: "What have you seen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing, go in! Su Ge did not say much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Travelers is one of the famous neutral mysterious organizations on the mainland. Its nature is similar to that of the Steam Union, which specializes in serving mysterious people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including accommodation, information exchange, material trading, secret auction, ritual production, and even tracking, assassination of all kinds of services, as long as the mysterious related services, they have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This grey zone is permitted by all churches. After all, it is not easy to track the mysterious people who are drifting away. If you can gather them, it is easy to count and manage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no fish in the water until clear, and any ruler knows this truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Travelers has branches like this in all parts of the world, and its positioning is relatively high-end, so its real name is processed and needs at least You can see it at thirty points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only people who can see the name can enjoy more core and advanced services. Others can only drink and drink in the lobby outside, and simply interact. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people walked in through the doorway. The first thing they saw was that a few guys were drinking coffee while playing the Kunte. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still a few people who are sleeping on the table, and some people whispering whispers, seemingly planning something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several shifts, energetic waiters rushing back and forth, cleaning up the hygiene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender at the front desk wiped the cup clean, carefully placed neatly, the piano on the inside was empty, and the pianist was estimated to have left work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several steel pipes are empty, and the girl above should also go with the pianist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are the two needs?" A waiter came over and asked politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is very skilled at pointing to the ceiling: "The frog eating."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge Looking up, I just saw a pattern on the ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pattern changes into different shapes at any time, Roland just finished, the frog that eats people becomes a six-legged dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sign of entering the underground, which is invisible to people below 15 points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This thing is quite interesting." Su Ge's mouth tilted slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter listened, turned his head slightly, with a hint of inquiries and cautiousness to see Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gentleman's gas field made him feel a little nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The four-headed mouse." Su Ge said at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter listened to a polite smile: "Upstairs please."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Roland Take Su Ge from the stairs on the left to the upper floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The layout upstairs is similar to the first floor, but the number is relatively small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people open the door near the left side and walk into a room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland read a few spells in a painting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is interested in looking at this mural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dust in the murals, in which you can see a vaguely huge figure in a yellow dress with a tentacle in the lower body floating in midair, dark The eyes under the hood look down on the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subtle gears sounded and the two opened a door in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the stairs down the door, after three turns, the two saw a huge space like the adventurers' guild hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to the real devil pub!" Roland opened his arms and said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looks at it, there are about 30 mysterious people in the hall, some are eating, some are joking, some are sweeping around, Seems to be looking for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are counters around the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The counter on the left provides food and drinks, and the counter on the right displays a variety of mysterious costumes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The innermost counter is full of mysterious materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The counters on the side of the two are...the Kent brand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged aunt behind the counter said in a kind and honest voice: "This elegant gentleman needs a set of silver limited editions issued this year. Is there a card that can show your identity and allow you to tighten the distance with other people here as soon as possible. The old saying goes, there are two ways to get familiar with strangers as soon as possible, one is drinking, the other is This is the Quint brand, the Quint card can bring people closer to each other!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and waved, followed Roland . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall atmosphere here is still normal, and there is no such sinister feeling in Su Ge’s imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
