			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 25, after seven days of sailing, the Sarois oceanic tanker successfully arrived in the imperial capital of Emperor Belgrade, the port on the west side of Huiyao City, and the port of Emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood on the deck of the cruise ship and watched the tall building in front of the tower interact with the minaret to cover the majestic city, taking a deep breath and saying: "This ghost place, if If you are not on the sea, it is not a place where people can wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The normal state of science and technology in the world today is the same as that of the second industrial revolution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All means of heating in Huiyao City in the north are coal burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a dense place, such a fierce burning of coal, the degree of horror of its air quality, China's emperor is far from being comparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, standing here, you can see that there are a lot of chimneys in the city, and there are a lot of black smoke coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the sea breeze in the sea brought a lot of smog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert sighed: "That's it, it's still one of the most desirable cities in the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge slightly asked: "What is our trip next time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our goal is north wind On the mainland, we need to rest here for a while, then take the airship to get there," Albert said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge touched his chin and said, "Airship? This is the time when the wind is big. Are you sure that the thing is safe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The monsoon will decrease a lot in June. We need to wait here for half a month. After the monsoon has completely subsided, the airship will be very safe." Albert said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge asks: "Why not take the boat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We were originally prepared to sit The ship, but you know, our whereabouts have gone wrong, all this is the route that I temporarily changed after communicating with the old dean." Albert tells the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge heard it, looked at the port that was approaching, and smiled and said: "Exactly, I have something to do here, half a month is enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Albert suddenly jumped, and the temptation reminded: "This is the Holy Blood Church Base Camp, you should be as careful as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sug smiled: "Reassured, I can still live enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conversation, accompanied by a whistling whistle, the big cruise Close to the port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge mentions the salute: "Go! I feel good about waving to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Then, four people followed the crowd and walked down the cruise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of advancement, Su Ge can feel that everyone is relaxed and happy, while his mouth constantly discusses their hero: Mr. Drake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night last night, according to the ship doctor’s report, Mr. Drake, who has been sleeping for a long time, has regained consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Mr. Drake did not suffer too much damage, just because the head was hit hard and some memory faults. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not affect him as a hero. Drake seems to be a natural hero. He naturally accepted his new identity and honor, and began to tell everyone the next morning. A very hard battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you heard the thrilling battle, everyone squeezed their fists, held their breath, and marveled at Dr. Drake’s hero and fearlessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The bugs seem to be taking action." Suddenly, she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned to look at the port, just to see a large number of soldiers wearing dark military uniforms and armed with firearms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at least two hundred soldiers. At this time, the neat lined up seems to be waiting for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of these soldiers, a middle-aged bishop wearing a gold-rimmed robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After middle age, there are ten deities who wear blue robe, five fully armed demon hunters, twenty dressed in white, with Exorcise nuns with veil and masks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out, they already know what’s going on on board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert turned his head and asked: "You two, do you need to pretend?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge indulged, nodded slightly and said, "Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are no acquaintances there, there are a large number of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of any feelings of everyone, the soul grail of Su Ge’s right hand flashed a blurry light and shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the appearance of Su Ge and Shirley suddenly changed a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change is very different from the previous two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this means?" Seeing, Albert was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not really a change of appearance, but a virtual image is mapped through the Holy Grail of the Soul, as if two masks cover the faces of two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow of people slowly walked down the cruise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the large number of people, although the two channels are open, the progress is very slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there are two groups of clergy at the two exits, there is a special instrument in hand to check each person who walks down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked and saw that there was not much martyrdom other than checking, so the whole progress was not slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of Su Ge’s VIP seats, the location is very high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he walked down the stairs, Sug turned his head and looked at it and squeezed a piece of others against him. He sighed: "The evil capitalism."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is not Big, but it happened to be heard by several clergymen in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark-skinned sinner has a strange face on his face, and his voice is soft: "Because of special events, routine inspections, please cooperate." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly, put down his luggage and spread his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of inspection is similar to the security of the aircraft. The personnel inspected are the sinners and the combat nuns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people of Su Ge passed the inspection smoothly and left quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That thing is to check mysterious fluctuations? Why didn't you respond?" Xuelier asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "Yes, the inner bell will vibrate when the mystery is detected, but do you think I will let it move?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley is also happy: "I like the feeling of fooling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a shock The master's Su Ge, as well as the support of the late bell, is naturally hand-to-hand for these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert didn’t know how to come over and ask, “What are you going to do now?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "There should be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, a luxury four-wheeled carriage with gold rims stopped to the side of the road. Then a middle-aged man in a formal dress came over and first bowed: "Is it Mr. Assassin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly, laughing Said: "Long time no see, Mr. Moggs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man was in the city of Bain, vying for "the sacrifice of blood", that A mysterious man representing Admiral, Moggs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
