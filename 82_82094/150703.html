			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"跪下!蝼蚁!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound is full of unknown majesty In the ears of Bart and Tyran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people stopped at the same time and turned to look at it. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they saw that the two professional-level fighters were stunned by an apprentice’s shackles, the eyes of Tyran I almost didn't show it, and I was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Bart on the side is frightened, for fear that the one will come directly here because of true anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This ability is not something that normal mystery can achieve." Tyran’s heart burst into a storm, feeling that his mysterious knowledge has been subverted for many years. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough and cough......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge’s cough came over and will The people were awakened from the shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tylan’s face is extremely gloomy: “Surely, as Gerryman said, this guy has a lot of weirdness. It seems that he is now exhausted and can’t Let him breathe this breath!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tearing this, Tyran immediately used a look to the professional swordsman, professional mad believer, professional assassin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three men immediately understood, and the strong body quickly rushed toward Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad cane is waving forward, first to organize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰Two gunshots interrupted his spellcasting after breaking his psionic shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart’s face was completely gloomy, his eyes suddenly burned two green fires, and a small amount of green lines appeared on his skin: “You are shameless and destroyed. My last patience for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle between mysterious people actually uses a pistol? This is an act that is disgusted and shameless by countless mysteries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a mystery with superiority, while keeping pace with the times, it has also retained some ancient traditions, that is, the system and restraint of the mysterious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious duel does not use the pistol is the top priority in the system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, it seems that when two people are doing mental arithmetic mathematics, one person suddenly violates the rules and takes out the calculator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unscrupulous, destructive behavior completely angered Bart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Su Ge coughed twice, took a deep breath, and after the breath was calmed down, the cane in his hand slammed into a silver sword. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand is falling, the sharp blade easily cuts the cervical spine in the flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpse is separated and blood is splashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg didn’t feel much at this time, it’s not like a human being, just a bug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was about to kill two other people, he suddenly felt a gust of wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly turned back and found that the three mysterious people with agility were already rushing to the distance of less than five meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of the corner of his mouth was wiped, and Sug squeezed his cane: "Luobo, let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with just three people, Su Ge did not let Luo wave his hands because he was afraid of such a sudden occurrence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are themselves in a weak position, and if they reveal all the cards, the battle will be very difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard Su Ge’s words, the second time, the whole body was tense, and the hair that was shining all over the body gradually became fluffy, as if it had been blown up by a hair dryer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the three men rushed forward from the front, and the weapons in their hands greeted Su Ge directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge is not in good health now, and he is completely disregarded by the siege of three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword in the hand slammed forward as the three men approached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hula! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary long sword instantly became a two-meter-long chain sword, sweeping the three people with a screaming wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people were shocked to see this look, but they were very easy to escape from the three directions. Attack, the next breath came to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the dim moonlight, Sug saw three mouths with white teeth open. Behind that mouth is like the version of the evil spirits, just like eating yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope your weapons can greet my heart." Su Ge thought, his body turned and ran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The psionic energy consumption is almost the same, and the physical skills and fighting skills are like children in front of these three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can only hope that he can drag the attack of three people, and take the opportunity to let the two of them kill the three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Ge was running very unruly, Erha opened his mouth and his body rushed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that rushed to the front was the swordsman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the big dog that suddenly rushed over, the swordsman just didn’t care, first indicated that his companion had caught up, his body stopped, and the sword in his hand directly stabbed Erha’s stomach, I want to stab it directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he waited for the second to hit his sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he felt a sudden cold wind blowing in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" A blink of an eye, the swordsman’s unexpected discovery of two haha ​​disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!" Tyran screamed in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsman hurriedly turned his head and saw the last vision of his life: a big mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood spattered, and the front paws of Erha grabbed the swordsman’s shoulders and broke his neck directly from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃呃呃...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swordsman’s hands clasped his neck and fell to the ground, his body constantly twitching , but did not have any ability to act, and quickly died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no stop for Erha, and he turned his head and saw that Su Ge, who had fled in front, was stabbed in the back of the assassin’s dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah! I am dead!" After being stabbed, Su Ge yelled and fell to the ground, motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜呜呜! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harsh wolf is thinking under the night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hahas quickly ran up. In the process of running, the whole body's hair is turned into a cold wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty meters away, almost a blink of an eye is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the cold wind surrounds the assassin in a circle, and when the assassin is stunned, he finds himself surrounded by a terrible cold wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't..." Feel the rapid drop in body temperature, the assassin has not finished, it has been completely frozen into ice sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last remaining mad believer, he is holding a stick at this time, still does not intend to let go of the body that Suge was stabbed, and raise the stick to be Su The head of the grid is gorgeous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two haha ​​here seem to be exhausted, the ice blue flame in the eyes gradually dissipates, and the speed of running is nothing to the ordinary dog. the difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold rifle emerged from the darkness and pierced the neck of the mad believer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
