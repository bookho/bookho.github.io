			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron in the air overlooking Sug, it is very surprising that Sug can say such things now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little guy, you have to think clearly, now your umbrella is gone, I can kill you now!" Ron said indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge silenced, it seemed to be awkward, and immediately asked: "You and Mayor Arno, are the same person!?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, it seems that your logic is really good." Ron said that he fell, his shadow under the bloody squirm, and then became the black suit. Mayor of Arno, who is kind and kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did you find out?" Ron was very calm at this time, not worried, and asked leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said indifferently: "Nature is because of those who commit suicide. What the suicides have in common is their godfather or you, or Arnold Mayor. Mayor Arnold is an absolute ordinary person. This is what Master Gerros has confirmed. He is a native of Bain. Now, the ceremony has started smoothly. As a mastermind at the same level as you, it does not appear here. That only shows that the so-called two masterminds are just the same person, and the former mayor of Arnold has been killed by you as your embarrassment, or a avatar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Not bad! Good!" Ron nodded and clap his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge’s frowning asked: “How did you do it, so that so many people willingly commit suicide for you and become the original to suppress the framework of the tactics? Psionic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron smiled and asked: "Is going to die, are you curious about these things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg replied very calmly: "Whoever is born or not is not necessarily. If you are afraid of me, you can refuse my question and kill me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I am afraid of you!? Hey, I really don't know how high the earth is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron immediately began to explain: "This is the foreshadowing of my early years." In my early years, I was a priest. I was the baptister priest of the first church in Bain because of my outstanding performance. Maybe I was born to be a bad person. My knowledge of the priest is different from others. I recite the scriptures to bless others and make them stronger and stronger. My prayers are gradually changing one's heart while chanting. Even ideology. I didn't notice so much at the time, and then the realm of the realm improved. In an occasional chance, I suddenly found out that all my godsons regarded me as a god and had a hidden fanaticism for me."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing this, Su Ge’s face was gloomy: “Do you still have this ability?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There is nothing impossible in this big world. Two years ago because of the vision The skyrocketing, my character has turned over, from the pure white to the pure black. In fact, flipping is a kind of evolution of our spirit! That flip, I got a new ability, shadow incarnation, change into any one person The look, although not fighting, can be left to my control, and the real person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, Ron is full of strange excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher the spirit, the more human spirit is removed from humanity. The process of growth has two important signs, one is flipping and the other is going crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flip is due to the cumulative growth of the vision, causing people's temperament to change, but the spirit is still very stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, it’s a process in which a bad person suddenly becomes a good person and a good person suddenly becomes a bad person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the growth of spiritual vision, my desire for knowledge is stronger, I am eager to know everything I don't know, I am eager to know the truth of the world, I I was eager to know the mystery of everything, even the look of the gods. So I started to prepare for this plan. In order to realize the necessary sacrifices, I killed Arnold, who is very powerful and has many godfathers, let my incarnation become Into him, the prayers passed gradually turned his godson into my godson. And when I need them, they can give me everything at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge squinted and asked: "Is Makok's suicide also your instructions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just let him qj Roland, as soon as possible The worm's egg hatched, but he couldn't do it. As for his suicide, it has nothing to do with me. It is estimated that I feel so sorry for me!" Ron said casually and casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you lead the Green Flame Brotherhood to summon the original fire here to do what?" Su Ge raised the doubts in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron said casually: "That's just an experiment. See if the law I gave them is good. I didn't expect it to be summoned. It's just right." The remnants they summoned became a coordinate and an anchor, and now they become the core of the summoning, saving me a lot of trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Ron pointed to the finger, and Sug turned to see that the green skull in the black mud was floating in midair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up at the bloody moon in the sky, Su Ge sighed: "You will really choose a good day."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, it’s all in my plan. The Bloodmoon Festival itself is a holiday in which the mainland sleeps and avoids disasters. So around this day, there will be no one to interfere with me, even if it is The entire city of Bain exploded, no one knows, because everyone is hiding at home and will not go out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron said excited He has undoubtedly presented his outstanding research results to Su Ge: "And I have studied this kind of moonlight for two years. I want to break the rules of the world and rely on the original power to create this world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When talking, the last wholesale mad citizen flocked into the circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the black mud like a tide directly fills the entire array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge closed his eyes and took a deep breath: "Ron, your wish will be broken in my hands, your wish, your dream, you The research will be broken under my pistol."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha ha ha!" When he heard Su Ge, Ron laughed and reached for a pinch. I lived in Su Ge’s neck and said, “If it’s not because of your cold heart, I’m interested. You don’t know how many times you’ve died. Do you know? Ants!”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge slowly opened his eyes and said faintly: "Who is the ant ant is not what you say, even if you can really summon the black goat of Mori? You are just her thousand One of the ones in the hands of the million."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Ron suddenly widened his eyes and looked shocked at the big shout: "Damn! How did you know the name! Say! You are How do you know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s mouth with a faint mock: “I know more than you think, but I’m now I don't want you to be embarrassed. What you have done today has completely angered me, so let's feel the trample of the ice hoof!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
