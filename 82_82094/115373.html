			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since three nights, the goddess' light has shined on the earth, and the moon in the sky is the body of the goddess. When you feel confused and desperate, reach out Embrace the moonlight, you can feel the love and kindness of the goddess, the gentle moon will wash your spirit, let you get peace and peace in the long night..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The content of "The Code of the Moon" was pronounced through the language of the psionic energy. Su Ge’s eyes clearly saw a circle of purple ripples coming from his mouth and spreading around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the two pale security guards, the face gradually returned to normal and his posture became calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grieman listened very comfortably, couldn’t help but close his eyes and enjoy with a touch of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Ge read, he looked at Joseph in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see the purple ripples coming into his body like a sinking sea, seems to be completely absorbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the meditation of constant rumors, the violent Joseph finally has a calm meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing up the mouth gradually closed, the turbid eyes closed slightly, and the distorted face appeared a bit of human struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the effect, Su Ge continues to motivate his psionics and continue to read. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minute later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't read..." The weak, subtle voice came from Joseph's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound is very subtle, like the sound of a mosquito. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a metaphor and exaggeration, but a real one. The sound of his voice is as subtle as a mosquito shaking his wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not Su Ge’s voice, he can’t even hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge stopped and used the words to ask: "What happened to you, the goddess? I can help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw it "Joseph said vaguely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you see?" Su Ge asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Joseph suddenly stopped talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continued to softly ask: "Please don't be afraid..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Ge said, Joseph suddenly became very surprised and his eyes suddenly turned into a green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘎嘣! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shrill sound of the joints sounded, and Joseph’s neck suddenly twisted into a strange angle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green eyes stared at Su Ge, revealing the mouth of the white teeth, and said in a horrible tone: "I am afraid? Little god officer, feeling It should be you who are afraid. Hehe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶嘶嘶! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this moment, Su Ge’s body is full of hair, and his expression is extremely dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the two security guards in the distance saw this suddenly frightened, suddenly screamed and turned and ran out crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregman is still very calm, watching the scary Joseph not talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Geqiang endured the trembling of his heart: "Who are you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At this point he has already determined that this guy should be possessed by something, just like being possessed by evil spirits in the movie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Joseph’s eyes gradually set aside two green liquids, and opened the big mouth and made a messy voice: "Your last days will come. Killed you and killed you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge heard the sound of the body and then stepped back two steps, a lot of sweat on his forehead, his face was very pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咕噜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A swallowing mouth, Su Ge stretched out his trembling hand and pinched the goddess pendant on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pendant is very stable, indicating that Joseph is still a human being, not a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! What the hell is going on!" Sug gritted his teeth and his heart was low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vomiting and vomiting......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Joseph made a messy voice, suddenly began to violently Vomiting up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the body trembled and stopped moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a more heart-felt person, Sug hurriedly turned his head back to Grimman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" Griman asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s face said: “Never come close to him, not even close to this house. This is a very serious matter. I need to ask for support.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grieman immediately nodded in a positive face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the explanation, Su Ge did not stop and turned and left quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! Damn!" Su Ge looked at himself and broke through the 20th, and his heart trembled fiercely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, just two points of Su Ge’s spiritual growth have once again broken through the second phase of the vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for his growth is because of Joseph’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing special about that sound, but Su Ge is terrible for people who have mysterious knowledge of sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he heard the sound that ordinary people could not hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the complete two forms, the material form is Joseph, he sends ordinary sound waves, which everyone can hear. And the form of will, that is completely Beyond humans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened very clearly, and the phrase "Your end is coming, killing you, killing you" also has Another completely different sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a terrible horrible sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger couldn’t understand what the voice was saying, only to hear a cry, like the sound of a burning flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s this strange sound that makes Sug’s scalp numb and the soul tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that? What does it mean?" Sug walked in the hallway, pinching his cane and thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After stepping out of the museum, Su Ge looked at the bright sky, but his heart was completely out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Sotos, what else do you need me to cooperate with?" Glyman’s legs seem to be very good, actually catching up with Su Ge Step by step, ask seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squeezed his palm and said, "I need you to give me a copy of Joseph’s home address."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Gregman nodded and said: "No problem, the place where he lives is not far from here, going east through three streets and arriving at Cui Shi Road, he lives in Room 404, No. 655."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Su Ge remembered, he turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregman looked at the back of Su Ge’s departure, with a weird smile on his lips and a subtle voice in his mouth: “The sacrifices and the medium are ready. , kill him to bring back. His brain can help us to guide the original fire from Joseph's body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand." Another subtle voice is not Know where it came from, and then quickly dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
