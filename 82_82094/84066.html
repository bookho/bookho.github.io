			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, the unconscious Su Ge was carried out by two exorcist nuns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the black blood vessels on the face of Su Ge have subsided. Although there is no sign of poisoning, the face is as white as the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My God! What happened in the end?" Roland, who was outside, saw this stunned run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack shouted: "Adam! Adam! Come over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam is the police station The forensic doctor has not left after a simple post-mortem examination in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leading double-edged nun put Su Ge down: "Reassure, he didn't die, just because the mental strength was overcoming the past."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a black-haired, gray-bearded middle-aged ran over and said to Su Ge, "There is really no problem, but there are a lot of people in his mouth. Ulcers and blisters, and they are corroded and appear to have been corroded by certain drugs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shoes Sisters sighed slightly and said: "He is a real The heroes, in order to purify those undead, let them return to the embrace of the goddess, will not become a sorrowful soul, drink the potion of the master of Geros to enhance the spirit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What! He drank the potion of the demon hunter!?" The police around him saw it completely silly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary people only drink the magic potion of the demon hunter in one situation, that is, when they want to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam heard a tremor in his heart, his gentle face was full of anxiety, and took out his stethoscope on Su Ge’s chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately! Fortunately! Cardiopulmonary function is stable and does not affect breathing and blood flow." Adam said with a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nun continued: "Reassured, he has been dealt with by the master, the potion will not cause any permanent damage to his body, but the temporary injury Very serious, it takes a period of training."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone heard this moment and let out a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than ten days of contact, they have a very good impression of this polite, friendly and friendly young people, plus a case that can help them easily break some troubles, every The individual is very friendly to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He saved a total of 29 innocent souls, freeing them, not becoming a terrible monster, you should be happy to have such a colleague Father Anthony came over and said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack heard the first time to go back to God, and Sug, who looked at the fainting, grinned: "It’s beautiful, you really are a competent priest." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievances on the ship were purified, the sinister breath and danger were not there, and the rest of the police began to upload the cleaning situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, full of dew, Warren wearing a black leather coat did not know where to come from and whispered: "Teacher, I follow the bloody taste about tracking After fifteen kilometers, the clue was completely cut off at the Kas Plain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ossen came over and took a piece of paper and said: "The telegraph according to the estuary This ship did not enter from the nearby port of Igo, and it is likely to have come in from other estuaries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to Su Ge just It is described that this ship encountered a small pirate ship, so these people did die at sea. Although the nearest port is the Igo port, which is 12 kilometers away from here, there are also some steep terrains that cannot build the port's estuary. Said Gerlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warren turned and asked: "Is the identity of this ship checked?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orson nodded and said: "I found out that the name of the ship is Suhu. It is a civilian merchant ship. The captain, Zach Howard, sailed from the Imperial Pearl Harbor on November 12, and the destination is the Grizzly Port of Beifeng Road. The main cargo above is fur and cotton. The registered crew is a total of 62 people. Fifty-four bodies are found here and eight people are missing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos Knocked on the pipe and said: "Handle the body first and protect the scene. Father Anthony arranges to prevent accidents. The exorcist and the priest are mixed and guarded. I am going to find the bishop's return."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, Master." Gerlos's position is very high, and Anthony and others listened to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After commanding, Gerlos brought Warren to the side of the police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Looking out, your relationship and Su Ge seem to be very good." Gerlos said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of police officers hurriedly turned to bow down and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two police officers carried him, we went directly to the Church of the Holy Blood." Gerlos turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sacred Blood Church!" Hearing this Jack and Roland was a shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church of the Holy Blood in every important city represents the city sheltered by the Church of the Holy Blood, and it is also the absolute center of the city, which has the most Safe place, the best medical conditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it blood therapy?" Jack thought Su Ge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood therapy is an outstanding invention of the Church of the Holy Blood, and was named one of the greatest miracle inventions in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the blood of various animals or humans to extract the magical ingredients and effects, and then mix and match to create a new blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering different blood depending on the degree and location of the person's injury can have a rapid therapeutic effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even, there has been a saying on the mainland: in front of the Church of the Holy Blood, the dividing line between life and death is just a bottle of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is very thorough this time, he doesn’t even have Entering the dream, consciousness falls into the deepest level of sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was vaguely regaining consciousness, he felt a magical warmth of strength entering his body along his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
