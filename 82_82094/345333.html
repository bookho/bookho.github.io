			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the Son of God is really born, then that existence should be a pure law of death. If I can have enough power for death, even if After the child is born, I can also handle it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the Lord of Storm and Death! The only true God of the Valley and the Abyss, the dominator of death..." This, Su Ge reluctantly sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, that is me, not me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and took two steps Su Ge continued to think about it: "My gods have a lot of power. Can I use some method to get the power of death in my body? If there is such a hint, I can gradually expand the death. The knowledge of the aspect, even if there is not enough power, at least in the face of the god of death, there is some self-protection ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a while, looking for Su Ge, who was less than a clue, returned to God and looked up: "I don't care about this for a while, since I already know their intentions, I can't continue to be so idle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Then Su Ge directly found the three servants brought by Randall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now you three go out quietly, two people fly to the sky, go to Central to see if there is any sign of a small scale becoming a werewolf, if there is, pass directly Your contact tells Randall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rest of the people quietly went to the residence of the Duke of the Mountains, remembering to follow the official path. After seeing a carriage coming here, confirm that a middle-aged man with a monocle, like a professor, is inside. He is called Oliver Finn. If there is, no matter what happens, immediately notify Randall, this is very important!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Sir." The three servants have been taught many times by Randall, and they are absolutely obedient to Suge. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go, fast! At the fastest speed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people immediately turned around Quietly leaving the hall, going out from the partial door in the dark bushes, turned into a shredded wing, a vampire with a sharp-nosed fangs flew into the air and quickly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here Su Ge with a calm smile found Vanas who is talking with many nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You talk first!" Vanas immediately bid farewell to these nobles, with Su Ge came to a relatively quiet living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge whispered the things he had just analyzed and turned to tell Randall: "What news is immediately available."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Vanas listened, he suddenly jumped in his heart: "Then we should inform Mil's grandfather as soon as possible to defend them quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suge waved his hand and said, "Wait to confirm that you are talking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Randall seems to hear something, then he said: "Mr. Oliver has been discovered. He is coming here with a lot of mysterious people, not far away, arriving in about five minutes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;希Ers whispered: "We should go back to the palace immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge shook his head: "It’s late, now the situation is not able to leave quickly. And don't you want to leave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas blinked in his eyes and nodded hard to answer: "Yes, if it really exists The plague problem, now is the time for me to gather the loyalty of these nobles. After they witnessed the ugly face of the Duke of the Mountain, they ran in despair and crying and prayed for me in front of me. The scene was so happy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said with a gratifying face: "A very mature idea, then kneel down, let go and do it! Have such a big rivalless Boss, after the eruption of the werewolf plague, is indeed the best time to gather people's hearts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But they all become werewolves, what should we do? Kill? "Virginia asked with a brow." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember someone said that after the werewolves turned, they could not only infect others, but they could return to human form after exhaustion, right?" Su Ge suddenly Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills nodded: "Connor does say that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge squinted and his face was confident: "That's very simple. The problem of werewolves is not a problem. I have a way to restore their minds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Today's Su Ge seems to have found some tips, and the ability to push the head has been strengthened in the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now regards the werewolf as a state of animalization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the beastly Luke and the mad ten church members recovered their minds after listening to the evening clock. Su Ge is now 90% sure that his own bells will restore the minds of those who become werewolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Vanas was very uplifted and happy, and if the Pope had this ability, she would not be able to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this ability to do the foundation, after the plague broke out, her ability to gather people's hearts will be upgraded several levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger said to Randall: "Let your servant return to the palace as soon as possible, and let Mil be ready for the highest level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall ordered immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Su Ge is just in case, whispering in Vanas’s ear: "Even if you are caught, don't be afraid, Death is one of my lords' powers. Even if you die, the Lord can make you resurrected. I have mastered their rituals. If they want to treat you as the best, then you..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas listened to Su Ge’s ear and felt the warm gasp, the heart began to pounce on the accelerated beating, the ears under the black hair faintly red, in the heart That is excited and happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, for Su Ge, she also wrote down the word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maria on the side saw this scene, his eyes darkly looked at Su Ge, and his heart said: "From the beginning, you have a different feeling for this. And the anomaly, as if two people had known each other before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope is... Is this Mr. Soge Sotos the teacher in his mouth? Under the ancestors!?" How sophisticated is Mary as a person, immediately thought of the key to the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
