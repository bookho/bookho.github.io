			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did you get in?" The group sat down and Vanas asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall smiled and said: "Because time is better, I took my servant and flew directly from the sky."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is my guard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I temporarily let them sleep, the guard work for the post is temporarily Instead of servants, please rest assured, the honorable Queen. My servants are safer and more trustworthy than your fighters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill Stare He asked: "First time, how do you let me believe in a high vampire with unknown origin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can not believe me, but you should believe "Mr. Randall said that he respectfully opened his body and gave up Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and asked: "We seem to have no choice now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mill's heart flashed a bit of dignity, turned to look at Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw Vanas’s eyes with faint excitement and worship, I said, “I am very trusting to Mr. Sotos, since You are the loyal servants of Mr. Sotos, then you will also gain my trust."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When heard of Vanas, Mill, Elena and Maria suddenly felt a little surprised, although Su Ge has been determined to be a companion, but so sloppy to put such a huge force on his side, which makes the three very surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mir slammed the topic back: "Since we have enough people, we have to decide what to do next."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to this, Vanas calms down and reverts to the dignified majesty, deep as an abyss, saying: "With the help of Mr. Sotos, We have a lot of power now, then we need two steps at the same time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because you want to be external, you have to take the lead in handling the internal Question. Mr. Randall, we are now being harassed and attacked by human face rats. It also carries people who have killed me without brains..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Randall listened to the description and said with confidence: "Although this new Yi family does not have much information, from the description point of view, my children can easily dispose of them, as long as it dares to come in, It will die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the problem of the human face rat can be solved, then the second problem is to solve those ambitions." Vanas continues Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, Randall seems to think of something: "When I mentioned the power, I saw two middle-aged women wearing costumes when I flew over. People walk around the castle with something that constantly releases a lot of psionic power. Is that yours or the enemy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Release a lot of psionics?" Mil's face is gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall nodded: "It should look like a mysterious costume that detects the array of sequences and runes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas immediately reacted: "Mir Grande!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know!" Mill said, his body rushed out like a gust of wind. The face is dark and the water has to be screwed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge touched his chin and said, "It seems that we still underestimated the greed and ignorance of these people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Things outside the food!" Vanas was gloomy at the end of the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina whispered: "They should be looking for the structure and weaknesses of the palace's statute. It seems that the scores of the Suger investigation are not bad, they are really The intention is to attack the palace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When things come here, they will give up to Mil's grandfather, and our core focus is on the outside nobles." Said Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To deal with these two members, the bond between us and the nobles has been broken. At this time, I have to take it out myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s self-confident said: “The problem is not big. The guards of the trip can be handed over to me. As long as they don’t have the lord-level characters, they can guarantee that they will be safe.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got two powerful secrets last night. Today Randall is here, and now Su Ge is very inflated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard such a confident tone, Vanas’s heart was full of security: “If you can, I will deal with things today, I will go outside. Submit a letter. Just two days later, there was a noble banquet in the Marquis of Raul, I am going to attend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Marquis of Raul is now comparing with the Gemini League Nearly? The last time Sakko’s madness has deepened the conflict between you and them, is this good?” Elena asked tentatively. Vanas said with a smile: "Reassured, the nobles of the present do not have a hope that I will die. I am going to arrest me at most and become a bargaining chip for other nobles." I really want to let my death be just a few people. Now with the help of Mr. Sotos, I can help me solve the problem of the little wave of people. I have the same way of dealing with other nobles."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge reveals a well-thought-out look, said indifferently: "Please rest assured that there is no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I Lena sneaked a peek at the high vampire who had lived for more than 500 years, and suddenly let go of her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Vanas finished, Su Ge stood up and began to command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Randall, then you help Master Mil and his Majesty deal with the following internal situations, and with your sensitivity to blood flow, you can easily All the spies are thrown out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall swears: "Yes, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vignia is responsible for protecting the safety of His Majesty. Hills assists Elena in protecting the safety of Connor. Your strong body can make up for Elena's starting point."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, sir!" Hills nodded hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virginia raised his hand and clenched his fist, and said with a confident face: "Reassured, Her Majesty is absolutely safe under the glory of the Holy Spirit." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded, picked up his cane in his left hand, pinched his right hand with black leather gloves and said, "Good, you can write now." Now, I will personally send you a notice, and touch the details of the other party."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
