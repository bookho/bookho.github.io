			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell is going on?" In the evening, Dr. Salo, the head of the death sect, Oliver and the director of the Institute of Polar Studies looked at it. The traces of the battle on the street, the face is gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two undercovers that were delegated did not return, and the two people who received the person did not return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop who traced the clue disappeared at the same time, and there were no more than five people, which shocked the two responsible persons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two people personally went out and found the mysterious traces. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they saw the bullets hitting the ground, the willows that were corroded and broken, and the blood stains that fell on the ground, the faces of the two men were completely gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is certain that these five people have been killed or taken away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell is going on? Isn’s the strength of Hayden not that you have the fighting power of the whole North? How suddenly was it taken? Still carrying my people and the two wastes?” Dr. Salo turned and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver was calm at this time and touched his chin and replied: "Hayden’s combat power is indeed the top of the whole North, but it does not mean that he is invincible. Very Ken can be the same master figure as you and me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Salo bites his teeth: "Shit! Now the mysterious situation of the whole studio is Our great powers have been firmly grasped. The number of masters can be counted by one hand, and these people are generally unable to leave their homes. Is there any other hidden power that has not appeared?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olifo nodded slightly: "It is possible, and this person is estimated to be the person on the Queen. You see, the whole cause is from the alley. Where is it?" The blood is yours. That is to say, they have encountered enemies there, and they have actively tracked the enemy and have been killed in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That means he The initial goal was only John and Kent and the two members, and Hayden was because of The confluence got involved in? "Dr. Salo also at this time to calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver nodded gloomyly: "If this is the case, we can't continue to look down on the Queen's side, speed up our progress, and turn the whole pharmacy into a plague as soon as possible. At that time, by capturing the palace, you can Replace the core death of the country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go back and report to the Lord to see what the Lord thinks!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two people disappeared into the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raul House. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kill! Kill! Kill the damn untouchables!" Prince Saku screamed after listening to the words of the woman in red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacco, who was crazy at the time, didn’t know what method he was using, but he regained his senses again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quiet." On the right side of the table, a man wearing a black feathered road and a dark red robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men with a hood, underneath the hood is a gray-white cheekbones mask covering the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male sent a low-pitched laughter and said, "Oh, since the Queen is so confident, then we welcome her. It’s just that day. Important gatherings, if they can fight with the Duke of the mountains, we can naturally save a lot of things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red woman nods and agrees: "That guy though It looks very general, but the ability is very different, it seems to be related to the sound wave, we have to be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The man will come here in these two days After all, the Queen usually sends a letter in advance, "the Duke of Raul asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is the case, it is possible that the guy seems to be very confident and contemptuous. Those who are mentally minded will definitely come here first to test one. Circle," said the woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mask male said: "Don’t pay too much attention to this, we really need to pay attention to the Holy Grail document."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, if he is really coming, you will have him for a while, Julie, but don't kill him. We don't want to avenge any faction when necessary. It is good to reserve a certain amount of space."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, High Priest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guines Palace, Queen's Study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas and Mill are sitting opposite each other, at this time the whole room is two of them, Maria and Veginiya are not there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill clearly felt the change of Vanas, but did not say much, the soft voice of the proposal: "Your Majesty, I have a proposal."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please say, Grandpa Mill." Vanas said with a close smile on his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill organized the language and said seriously: "From the current situation, and the performance of Su Ge today. They are deliberately helping us, but real The purpose is probably to hope that their organization can take root in Guinness, forming a stable sphere of influence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas heard a glimpse, then suddenly I thought, "My God! Right! Now our church in the late bell does not seem to have a clear sphere of influence. So why not let the Pope set up its headquarters in Guinness? Ah! The headquarters of the Church is in our country. "How happy is it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Mill, you are so wise, I have never thought of it before." Vanas has a brilliant look and excitement. Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill smiled slightly: "The relationship between Su Ge and the witch made him destined to be incompatible with the Church of the Holy Blood. But he now represents the Church of the Holy Blood, then why don't we? Through him to seek the power of the Church of the Holy Blood? We can have deep cooperation with Su Ge, let him be based here, his power is very strong, can make up for the weakness of our country's power. At the same time we also master their biggest In the negotiations with the Church of the Holy Blood, with Su Ge as the link, he was appointed to manage the bishops here, so that we can not only get the strength and materials of the Church of the Holy Blood, but also because of the reason of Su Ge in the middle, Can have the greatest autonomy. We provide him with the site and shelter, and he bears the pressure and management of the church for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas heard this and I didn't continue to be excited, because when I first talked with myself in my dreams, the Pope had already decided on such methods and routes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
