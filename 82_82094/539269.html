			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a butcher, the two quickly separated from the bridge and they didn't want to see what was in the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the narrow path, the two quickly came to the edge of a high wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large amount of wood coffin placed at the root of this high wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The materials of these coffins have been decayed, but there is no loose frame. Su Ge slammed the cover and found that the coffin to be decayed was invisible. Power protection is comparable to steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coffin has a chest with hands clasped, and it looks like a mummy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the corpse is black, just like being burned to death, and his eyes are covered with linen similar to those of the residents. I don't know what this means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher’s line of sight was not placed on the coffin. He looked up at the high wall about five meters high and said, “You can reach the bridge directly from here. About a hundred meters forward is the territory of the Chuqiu people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theft, the butcher's legs gradually bend, the horrible intensification works on his legs. On the top, let him jump six feet high and stand up on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge has some envy, then shoots the claws and brings himself to the wall with the force of the hooks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing on the wall, Su Ge discovered that this was not a wall, but the foundation of a very wide bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bridge is huge and magnificent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall bridge is grayish white, 20 meters wide and stretches straight forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guardrails on both sides of the road are now gone, only the slightly raised guards, the guardrail above seems to be some kind of huge monster, with a paw free The fight is completely destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger can also see twisted iron pipes and cracked stones from the side of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the bridge is a thick building. After the building, a slightly higher place is the end of one end of the bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an incomparably grand and towering church with a huge level of grandeur even larger than the Cathedral of the Holy Blood in Bain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most crucial thing is that there is a huge tower in the middle of the cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tower has about a dozen floors, and at the top is a series of huge buildings that are invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people’s eyes did not stay there, and the two people were more focused on the front of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of debris on this magnificent bridge, such as broken carriages, dead bones of horses, scattered sacks and goods, and even a lot of discarded Armor and weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many pillars and statues on both sides of the road ahead, but at this time the statues above are all without exception, all of them are cut off, see Unclear the original face of the statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ruins, Su Ge could see some red, thin bodies running around in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those should be the Chuqiu people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Somewhat wrong." The butcher frowned and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg asked: "What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hills I saw before People are very calm, they seem to be sleeping, now so inciting, they seem to be fighting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge heard a sudden burst of a figure from a carriage, Then a few Qiuqiu people jumped like a monkey, hugged the man's arm, his head, and the body screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the stripping of the armor, the black blood splatters, the man is directly directly, and falls to the ground to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a catastrophic hunter!" Su Ge said uglyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spraying dark blood is a sign of a hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher’s eyes flashed brightly, and the eyes of the god looked at the front and said: “A total of three teams of hunters have killed the Qiuqiu people. Half."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do they fight the Chuqiu people? In the current situation, should they be allies?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher shook his head and said that he did not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meditation of Su Ge’s brow furrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he thought of an important key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You just said that the great bishop has a pair of eyes that can see through the real, right?" Su Ge asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher nodded slightly. Su Ge pointed to the ruins on the other side of the bridge and asked: "She is in the ruins now, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher continued to nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The hunter wants her eyes." Su Ge said in a positive color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard this, the butcher first saw it, and then his face changed slightly: "You can't let them succeed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the front and asked: "How is the battle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hunter dominates, the Chuqiu people still have thirty More than three, the masters of the three teams of hunters are alive, and the team has six remaining."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sighed and said: "In the past, now is It’s a good time to take advantage of the benefits of the fisherman.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you sure?” The butcher was somewhat hesitant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he added: "After all, it is a hunter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Butcher Suddenly stunned by the hunter, this made Suger somewhat surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Su Ge, who is not afraid of tigers, is not afraid of the tiger. He looks at the front and says, "This is our only chance. If they wait for the Qiuqiu people to get it, then the battle will be more difficult."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher listened to the jagged chopper in his hand and silenced for a few seconds: "Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two quickly approached through the carriage of the carriage and the goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle ahead seemed fierce, and neither side noticed the two people who were close to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quietly coming behind the carriage less than 20 meters away, Su Ge released the night bell to observe the situation ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, there are still about twenty people in the Qiuqiu, and there are only eight people left in the disaster hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle on both sides continues, the Qiuqiu people are very fearless and fierce, and they have a clear battle mind and are not afraid of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They wore simple armor, armed weapons, and the blessings of the Qiuqiu people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bang.........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thunderous thunder sounded, and Su Ge actually saw the figure The thin and thin hills of the people raised their hands and smashed the old human bones, causing a violent thunder,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lightning has a fan shape that covers all the hunters in front. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the life of these hunters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunter in a steel armor, the lightning resistance is negative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thunder and lightning, not only caused great harm to the hunters, but also made them stiff and temporarily lost their mobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chuqiu people who had already prepared for it were rushing up with their own simple weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, five professional-level hunters were completely shredded, leaving only three master-level hunters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this sudden flip, Su Ge couldn’t help but widen his eyes: "This is a terrible big turn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher pinches the weapon: "The mysterious battle is like this. There is no strongest knowledge, only the most knowledgeable. No one can relax the vigilance in the end, because you don't know each other. In seconds, I will take out something to counterattack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge deeply agrees to nod, after all, the mysterious battle is different from the physical battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical battle You can see each other's system, the other's physical strength and wounds, can see what the other party can hurt you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the mystery itself is the mysterious and mysterious thing. If you can’t tell the truth, even if you win the battle, you will be negligent and be ruined. The injury is a trivial matter, a little serious. It will fall into madness or die directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shock of Su Ge, the flip is not over yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master-level hunters are still negative, but they are strong enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only three masters of the catastrophic hunters who are huddled together at this time to form a horn. The horrible triangle is like telling the rotating triangular blade, in an instant. A dozen or so Qiuqiu people were shredded, and they came directly to the sacrifice that was at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed, the battle is like a bit of a high-speed rotating bit in a group of meat, unbreakable, all the existence is completely shredded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three weapons are lifted at the same time, and then the triangle array rotates again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One eye and one knife in the blink of an eye, the sacrifice was completely divided and completely dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you block it?" Su Ge asked with a dignified face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher contemplates for three seconds and nods slightly: "I can barely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A few knives?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher contemplates three seconds: "Thirty Knives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug Pud Micro-Lock The cane turned into a long sword and seriously said: "Okay, one by one. I will let Lobo first freeze a hunter, and the two of us will join together to kill the other two and destroy their formation."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their physical defense is very high, I can only defend, the attack is limited, what is your solution?" Butcher asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squeezed his palm and said: "Reassured, my attack they can't defend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The butcher looked at Su Ge's precise and stable appearance, and did not talk nonsense, and stood up slightly: "Good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining three captains are in the air All the rest of the Qiuqi people were killed, and then they walked silently along the bridge. As Suge said, their goal was also embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the butcher and Su Ge quickly emerged from behind the carriage, and the butcher said: "Stand up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The three hunters hunted and turned their heads, and the four eyes under the four holes in the steel helmet looked at the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kill..." The three captains said at the same time, as if their thoughts were synchronous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Su Ge pinches his cane to adjust his body state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time he has faced the legendary hunter, as Moore said, just facing it, you will feel a The ominous breath is in your heart, making people feel dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night of the town’s soul is constantly echoing, and Su Ge takes a deep breath and tightens his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the horrible triangle array started again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance of twenty-five meters, three people seem to pass through time and space, it seems that a blink of an eye directly appeared in front of two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
