			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the departure of Cui Xi, Coase stood up and stood by the window, looking at the two men who walked out with each other, Bernice and Tracy, calmly said "Although I want to draw Su Ge, but she is a witch after all, is it too risky?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ges calmly said: "I have lost one Daughter, even if I am going to die, I won't let Tracy take risks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I heard this, Coase looked at Green and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green continues: "The little girl is very courageous and intelligent. She is much more mature than Tracy, and she is not too much for Tracy. More hostility. Even the encounter between two people is accidental."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coase listened to some accidents, he did not understand the past of this steel witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know some information, she is very famous in the bottom of the aristocratic circle recently, there are already many small nobles who are fascinated by her fans, but no one Can touch her." Coase came to some interest when it came to this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green followed him and looked down: "She has no fascination with the world, she is a true fanatic."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mad believer?" Coase glimpsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green’s gaze said deeply: “I was able to see it from her eyes when I met last time. She has already given everything to herself. Faith, giving all his love to the Pope, different from the so-called mad believer profession, she is a true mad believer, her mind is not subject to any restrictions and suppression, but at the same time with faith and Pope as absolute The center uses all its knowledge and wisdom to create the greatest benefit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coase heard this accident, then touched his chin and said, "But generally Such a person, the more unscrupulous, the illusion of the resurrection of the female warlock is like this, almost useless. With her color and wisdom, if you really put down the body, it is estimated that the church has helped a large number of diehards. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green silenced and whispered: "This is also the most horrible place in the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“How come?” Coase is more curious about this little church. Green sat down and explained: "I learned the teachings of some late churches through Tracy. This church advocates containment, protection, equality, freedom, and the whole church. Believers have almost no constraints, and there is an extra emphasis on a core key.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Clean and self-sufficient, that is, the importance of self." Green said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clean and self-sufficient? The importance of self?" Coase eyes lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greek sighed and said: "There are countless religions since ancient times. For the believers to spread all the dedication to the gods, they are in poverty, in order to receive the salvation of the gods. But they are different, their doctrine emphasizes that each of them is a god's people, and is an important child of the gods. The doctrine explicitly prohibits the method of sacrificing oneself for the purpose, and even expresses the dangerous thing that is unsure. Don't do it, all actions are based on self-security. At the same time, it is emphasized that the gods need them to be devout faith and loyal heart, not the dead soul and self-harm. If prohibited, not only will they be expelled from the church, but also The knight of the gods kills, and the soul falls into the abyss forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha!?" Hearing this, Coston’s eyes widened and his face was unbelievable. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has read history and has studied profoundly in many churches in history. The teachings are very well understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he has never seen this doctrine, this thing is almost the opposite of the normal doctrine! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of thinking is a daunting thing, how can it be a big thing? What is the use of such a selfish person?" Coase asked. . Green sighed and said, "It’s too narrow for you to think so. They are very pious and loyal to God. Because of this constraint, let them be gods." They are even more grateful. Therefore, they become truly terrifying. They are too stable and concealed, they will give up the simple method without brains, in the case of this constraint, the ultimate development of the brain and knowledge of the self, thus Think of one and another plan that is invisible and safe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you don't shoot, you can't find it. Once they are sure to shoot, you still can't find it. They are invisible and invisible everywhere. They are self-satisfied, seemingly afraid of death, selfishness, and no difference to ordinary people. You said, if you encounter such a gang, what should you be from?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Coase thinks about the relationship. Then there was a horror in the eyes: "If that's the case, it's really terrible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green continues: "And the evening bell teaches this doctrine It is easy to get the resonance of ordinary people, and it is very communicative, but I said that they are adequately clean and self-sufficient, and they are restrained. They never show their identity, and they never take the initiative to absorb ordinary believers. Theirs Self-discipline and discretion, even more powerful than senior clergy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coss frowned and said: "But this method must have a devout enough Faith and enough Big deterrent, can really even need a show of gods, it is almost impossible "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Greene silent moment, did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some things he is not sure about, rashly speaking out, will only upset his brother's thoughts and plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s okay, if it’s a fake and it’s a big mistake, he can’t afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he decides whether or not the god is really there, and he first secretly observes for a while and makes a conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coase touched his chin and analyzed: "The one that is not available is always the most eager. Seeing is in front of you, but you are not the most awkward." Now think about it, if Bernice really goes to bed with the nobles directly, the effect is not as good as it is now. Enough mystery, enough noble and pure, will cause the conquest and interest of those who think they are nobles."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green reminded: "You should also be grateful for the teachings of the church in the evening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coase thinks about it, the body of the witch, ordinary people can't touch it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now no one knows how many witches the church has mastered in the late evening, from the early news of the ancient city of Aya, in the late five-year-old Wu Xiong, There are two witches, and they are master witches, the frost and sound waves that the church has been waiting for for many years. There is also a master vampire, and a non-human terror, war."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two Master Witches..." Coase was once again immersed in contemplation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green continues: "This is still a year and a half ago. The name of the church in the late night is very famous throughout the mysterious world, especially the doctrine and creed. And what they did at the time. This made them very popular. In the past year and a half, the investigation of the church in the late bell has never stopped. However, these people are missing, no one knows what they are developing. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green reminded: "Since choosing cooperation, I hope that we can position ourselves and prepare for the future. Don't treat them as A small church that cooperates temporarily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coase agreed to nod. "The church is really involved in the night, because that is so lonely." The wolf, the Wolf Blood Legion has already indicated its attitude. The Fortress is not a fortress. It is directly recognized as an ally by the Church of the Late Bells. The Elf Church also considers the late bell church as a friend for some reasons, because of these forces, The Church of the Moon and the Glorious Church have always been Dare to go deep into the church of the late bell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that the church has also fallen into disagreement in March. The Holy Father several times and three popes I have made a negotiation, but I don’t know the specifics, but it seems to have played a very important role,” Green said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After all, the Holy Father!" Coase said with respect on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both people hate the March Church, but they are extremely respectful and admired by the Holy Father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they know that these people are true saints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men had been fighting outside for many years, and they were actually crawling out of the iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially in the battlefield where there are many dead people, there are often some ghosts, ghouls, and even some horrible things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of these things, the two men’s troops were not helped by the Holy Fathers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a large-scale war occurs, the Holy Father will hear it in advance, fearing that there will be something terrible in the dead, and on the other hand, protecting civilians. To prevent those who kill red-eye soldiers from burning, looting and looting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when you are lying on the blood, you can rescue some soldiers and surviving souls from the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you see that scene, even a hard-hearted person will feel moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You said that the church in the evening is only the one in the capital?" Coase asked. Green shook his head. "Of course it is impossible. There is a teacher on her head. She once mentioned it. That one is at least a master, even a lord." The strong one. That one is even more hidden. I still don't know whether he is a man or a woman, where he lives and how old he is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You actually I don't know!?" Coase asked unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green nodded: "He once took the initiative to pass me, saying that he and his students did not have any malice. The kind of sturdy spirit has reached the lord infinitely. I tried to track it later, but nothing was obtained, and even the psionic fluctuations and mysterious traces were inaccurate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coase touched his chin and said: If there is no accident, this one should be a witch or a female warlock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!? Why?" Green was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colin said: "It’s not just a master mystery who has this kind of top-level hidden means. This kind of person must be the kind of all-night wanted and The investigation has formed an instinct for concealment and prevention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
