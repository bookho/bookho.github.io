			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the knife street went north for about 500 meters, two people followed the street into Kaixuan Street. Three kilometers along the Arc de Triomphe, you will be able to reach the Arc de Triomphe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Arc de Triomphe, it is the Ten Victory Gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is Saturday, there are many pedestrians on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The climate at the end of May is very good, it can't be hot, the sun is shining, and there is no cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have put on thin casual clothes, with relatively thin hats and jazz caps, walking together on the streets, or shopping for shopping, or Going to the park for a leisurely morning, or preparing to go to a beautiful flower garden to experience the beautiful flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looks at it, the main crowd on the street is around 35 years old, these people are the mainstream workers in the whole society today, but also the income Quite a good middle class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are also some loving old couples who enjoy the bright sunshine, or young and energetic young men and women, chasing each other and arrogantly swaying youthful vigour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the still loose crowd, Su Ge squinted very enjoyablely and looked around: "I like this peaceful scene and atmosphere." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly looked around and gave a slight nod to agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arc de Triomphe is very wide and roughly counts as much as thirty meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This avenue runs through the entire city of Hui Yao, but such a boulevard is not allowed to drive vehicles under normal circumstances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, the great lord of Salurus returned from here, and it was a path full of glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only three cases where vehicles are allowed to pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the royal family and is qualified to travel here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is that the general who returned from the expedition is eligible to drive the vehicle here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregor General was here to expedite the Triumph three times in ten years and was crowned the legendary general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last one is the outbreak of war, and the war has spread to the vicinity of the capital, where it will become a special road for the army to resupply, when ordinary people are not Can be close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl does not like others to be too close to her, so she likes a relatively wide, and few people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This broad triumphant avenue barely met her requirements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley slowly turned the parasol in his hand and swept his eyes around his eyes, seemingly satisfied with everything around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This place is good, we have to do one in the future." After five minutes, Sherry said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart smiled and held her hand with black lace gloves and said, “Well, we can build an ideal city that is isolated from the world. Live in the city and look down on all humans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing Su Ge’s casual talk, Shirley’s eyes slammed: “This is a good idea!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Su Ge immediately transformed the topic: "The two women, do you feel it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "They are not qualified to let me take the initiative to feel." Xue Lier said disdainfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has got used to it and continues: "They have a shadow on them, a mysterious shadow. Although they escaped from the ceremony, the ceremony Causal has already been applied to them. In terms of their physical physique, they are close to the psychic, which is very easy to provoke mysterious and unfortunate physique."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What?” Shirley then took a glass of sugar from his bag and said it in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said: "They will find me for help soon, wait for me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for Su Ge to finish, Shirley took out a glass of sugar and stuffed it into Su Ge’s mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down at the stunned Shirley, Su Ge stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you looking at?" Sherry took a look back and walked two steps forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has a candy with a touch of wine, and the heart is surrounded by a special kind of feeling, which is very comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it’s a good look!" Su Ge said with candy, and quickly followed up to vaguely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten Shoumen, Kaixuan Square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fountain on the west side of the square, surrounded by a beautiful flower bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flower bed looks like a huge crown, composed of flowers of about thirty colors, colorful, dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this, Shirley’s eyes were instantly attracted to this huge flower bed, and he walked over and explored the body and looked at the crown. Dark flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This flower is dark and looks like a rose, but the petals are thicker and bigger, with two more petals than the rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowers give people a deep, solemn feeling, like the obsidian armor worn by Sarlux when he was out, and the overall crown-shaped flower bed is so noble luxurious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood by Shirley and said unexpectedly: "What is this flower? It is really beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This flower is called the Black Devil. It is the only flower that blooms in the abyss. It was brought back from the abyss by the original Saruros. The flower language is: like steel. The willer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange voice came, the voice was very neutral, very nice, clear, and there was a special magnet in the vocal cord that made people listen. It is very comfortable to go up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge first kept Shirley behind him and turned to look at it, just to see a gray robe with a faint cyan roe. The young man with a ponytail and a necklace of teeth on his neck looked at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth is about thirty-five, and it looks good. It has thick eyebrows, brown skin, almost the same height, and is well-proportioned. The atmosphere is restrained and elegant. The left hand holds a black wooden cane and ten fingers carry ten silver. A ring, a book hanging under the waist of a robe, looks like a scholarly scholar, and seems to be a poet full of romance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley standing behind Su Ge showed a very violent breath at this time, slowly raising his hand and going to shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let Su Ge grab it again and press it on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the attention of Shirley, this youthful look suddenly shocked, and then quickly and respectfully stepped back two steps, said: "The beautiful sage of the crown I am very sorry to disturb you to see flowers, ignorant ignorant bards, and Gu Ju sincerely apologizes to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, his body bends deeper The attitude is respectful and not very interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the youth doing this gift, Su Ge’s attitude was a little shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a surprise to the youth’s timidity, but to the horrible insight of the youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can see the nature of Shelly at a glance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent Shirley heard this series of respectful compliments, and after the courtesy of this place, he snorted: "Give it to you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, turn and continue to enjoy the flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugarton was secretly relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl is really violent, he has no way to subdue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very uncomfortable with your pinch." Sherry's voice came again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge immediately released his hand and smiled and said: "Look at you, let me teach this gentleman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Su Ge coughed and pretended to be serious: "This gentleman, please here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;The young man nodded after listening to him and followed Suge a little further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't go too far!" Sherry's voice came again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and nodded, stopped at about five meters from Sherry, and sighed in a low voice: "I am sorry, my fiancee is a bit violent. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man looked at Su Ge, his eyes finally swept over Suger’s cane and gloves, his face full of admiration and said: “It’s amazing. You can surrender this kind of beautiful existence that cannot exist in the world. I am really right to come to Hui Yao City this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s eyes flashed with special The radiance: "You are called Guju, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young smile nodded: "Thank you for remembering my name, although it is a bit strange, but The customs of my hometown are somewhat different from here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge puts his hand on the wave: "I understand that my only experience is to go to many places and see I have a lot of scenery and people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can feel your erudition and maturity, which makes me feel very happy Gu Ju said, he skillfully solved the big book at the waist, took out a black and worn pen from the robe, wrote something on it, and then apologized and said: "Sorry, as you know." I am a bard, and some flashing inspirations need to be written down, otherwise it is easy to forget."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and swept his book On the messy font, I smiled and said: "I understand, to be honest, I have written novels, and these things are really inaccurate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Thank you for your understanding.” Gu Jue said very pleased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Odin Assassin, I really like to make friends with erudite people." Su Ge smiled and reached out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gujian said with a hand: "We are really interested in the same thing, I also like to make friends with scholars."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha, that's really a good thing." Su Ge said haha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
