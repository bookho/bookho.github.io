			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan is a very cute person, and Su Ge and his contact for half an hour are obviously felt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 27-year-old youth is introverted, purely kind, conscientiously focused, eager for others to praise, but also feels shy because of others’ approval Sorry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very happy to help others, but he is not willing to speak because he is afraid of refusal and not knowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can be happy with two good words, and you can't wait for Suge as your best friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony is a thorough understanding of Sug’s fart, and he secretly said: "This should be written down. If you encounter this aspect in the future, you can come and ask." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that two people get along very well, Anthony is very happy to say: "Ivan, Su Ge is very familiar with the mystery now. Interested, I want him to follow you to learn some basic questions, no problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem, of course no problem!" Ivan is refreshing The answer, while enthusiastically introducing Su Ge to his latest invention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first meeting was very smooth. Su Ge left here here after talking with Ivan for two hours, ready to officially report tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are coming tomorrow!" Standing at the door of the church, Ivan said with some reluctance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and nodded: "Well, will come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Random two people coming out The door, I haven’t walked two steps, and Ivan’s voice came from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Must come! I will show you good things!" Ivan half-body hide behind the door at this time, revealing his head and shouting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has a somewhat helpless smile: "Must! I swear to the goddess!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard this Ivan relaxed and laughed: "Must come!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finished, turned and closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking on the road, Anthony sighed: "Ivan is a bitter child. He was very sensitive to mystery from an early age. It belongs to the kind of natural mysterious physique and often encounters Mysterious events, I heard some strange voices, because such experiences made him alienated and rejected by his companions. Finally, his parents thought that he had mental illness and sent him to the welfare of the church until he was 12 years old. It was discovered that high-intensity mystery learning and research were carried out as key seedlings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inflation in childhood, the control of juveniles made Ivan gradually form this awkwardness Personality, I hope you don't care."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "I feel that he is very cute, I believe that he can be a good friend with him." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony smiled with relief: "That's good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell to Fr. Anthony When Su Ge returned to the small lecture hall, he suddenly felt the heavy feeling of his head.  Disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recall that I have just experienced, Su Ge sighed: "People still have to use more brains, I did not expect the stimulus and excitement just encountered will actually My head is open."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain is back to normal, and Su Ge is not eager to continue learning, but does nothing, temporarily letting the brain go empty and get the most Original relaxation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, he did not stay in the church, but returned home with "The Evening Clock of Glen". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got home, Erha was kneeling on the floor, very happy with a big bone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ada should go to volunteers to help the poor?" Su Ge knows Ada's habits very well, and she knows her actions when she asks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took off his clothes and lay on the sofa and turned to look at the bright sky outside the window, slowly closing his eyes and resting quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intensive study in so many days, even if the spirit and body are not tired, the mentality is also tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs to suspend now, even if it is an afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Suge bid farewell to Ada, clean up the daily necessities With two haha ​​back to the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two-day holiday of Cangyue Festival has passed, and today is the day of official work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple clean up, Su Ge came to Ivan’s mysterious workshop with his second ha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sug walked in, Ivan flew straight down and took a deep breath: "I finally came, I thought you were not Come here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at him who is so insecure, Su Ge’s eyes seem to be watching his younger brother, and he calms: "Reassured, the future I will be here to follow you for a few months. What do we study today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan was excited, his eyes sparkling with shining light Say: "What do you want to learn? Make magic, array, spells, costumes, potions, potions, I will!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge thought about it and found it later I am blank in these areas, only know some basic theories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after three seconds of silence, he said seriously: "I want to learn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When I heard this, Ivan grasped Su Ge's hand and was excited. It seemed to find a confidant: "Good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today we are everything The basis of the spell: the beginning of the spell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Ivan took Su Ge all the way to the second floor, a room full of books of all kinds, rushed in After a rush of dust, I took a big book and said, "Start learning from this book!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took the book and looked at it. The name is simple: "The spell." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The spell, I am more accustomed to saying it is a rune, because the rune is more relevant to the description of its nature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
