Accepted. At the same time, the relevant characters on board each returned to their own place, while waiting for the follow-up questioning of the church, after all, the loss of this matter is very huge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duke was shocked to return to his family, and Macock took the other people to quickly report to General Green’s house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actor Mary is restlessly returning to her home at 3479 Beth Street. This time there are too many trips, she now feels that something is following her. She needs a good rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her, there is also sexy Miss Angie who survived the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two as survivors are at the same time, and they can have some sense of security when living together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his own entourage, Albert directly entered the Cathedral of the Holy Blood and re-planned his future plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta did not contact his own female warlock’s companion because of his identity, nor did he report the information he knew, or even directly disappeared. The existence of the grid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a long time, she made her own choice for the first time with her own will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time she is also watching, watching Su Ge here is not as terrible as he said, pervasive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, wearing the hero of all, great, selfless, heroic, fearless Mr. Drake has been taken to the police station for a round, no After discovering any problems, they were returned to Green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the Saroni belongs to the royal family. Even if there is a problem, there is no room for the church to intervene, especially the admiral who is extremely disgusted with the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for how the Admiral handles this, there is no hero like this. They are not qualified to manage this group of police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a burst of comfortable and comfortable, Shirley's white skin is full of rosy and sweaty, and the body is stiff for a long time, comfortably squatting in Su Ge In the arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge gasps and breathes a sigh of relief, holding her soft body and softly asking: "Is it comfortable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl did not want to move a finger at this time, um, it was satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge’s heart suddenly took a deep breath, then changed to a bed sheet and hugged Shirley to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a lot of things waiting for him to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge came to the dream, the core staff of the late bell church had arrived in the vast pilgrimage hall. At the forefront is Vanas, on both sides of the Death Apostle Walter, War Apostle Gerlos, Plague Apostle Candidate Luke, Storm Archbishop Eide Lynn, Storm Archbishop Randall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come you are so late?" Vanas frowned and his voice was unpleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug sighed: "No way, I have to deal with the goblin first, otherwise I can't sleep at all."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Vanas brows a little: "What is his situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Also, it is completely secure "Speaking of this, Su Ge is full of self-confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley is a cold iron full of spikes and venom, and it is now completely hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest Walter sent a calm and kind voice: "Your Majesty, don't be too harsh and responsible, you should be very clear, now the busiest of all. The nervous thing is to hold the clock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next to Jerouss looked at Su Ge, and suddenly there was a feeling in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, Su Ge is late and seems to be related to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline cuts the topic: "Have you met with Bernice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sug nodded, his face full of praise: "I have already known the situation, you are doing very well! Very good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen At this point, Adelinton was very happy and sincerely said: "Thank you for your compliment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss added: "I and Adeline have already The two sides of the church and the royal family are completely stabilized. At present, the relationship between the two sides is very subtle. They are already disgusted with each other at the same time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has: "In terms of security, haven't found anything on either side?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luke’s voice confidently said: "Reassured, the whole thing I personally shot, I even made some horoscope interference orientation, absolutely no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good!" Su Ge nodded hard, and he was completely relieved.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Vanas said: "Today, we will bring you together, mainly to determine our actions in Huiyao City. Waiting for fifteen days in Hui Yao City, Gerlos, Adeline, if you have any needs, or what plans can be said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos The demeanor said: "You should all hear some winds. I can be sure that the Holy Blood Maze does have problems, but as for the problem, I am still unclear."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas turned to ask: "What about Luke?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke spread his hands: "I don't know where I am, You should ask Walter about this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone looks at Father Water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the big dark hood, the two ice-blue flames are slowly surrounded, and the flames are a pair of calm and wise eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
