			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps: Adding more to the global cold weather of the lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This collaboration is different from the last time with Bart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the cooperation Su Ge has taken the absolute lead. Elena has absolute trust in herself, and Vanas is her own crazy brain powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon mir, who had been worried about Su Ge before, did not have much trust through a series of contacts, but he is very clear that this mil is absolutely loyal Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this loop, as Suge said, everyone in this room is his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a simple chat, Mill asked: "Talk about this situation first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Su Ge then said all the circumstances of his investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Irene was shocked and asked: "I heard that there are no living things there, everything is burned clean, there is no clue, you How is the investigation so detailed!? This level of detail, you have experienced the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge mysterious smile: "There are many situations, really The clues are on some dead objects, some dead creatures that are not afraid of the fire, such as ... soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soul!?" Elena and Vana Si Yi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill squinted and said, "That is, you are a priest, and is a priest who can talk to the dead?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug hit a finger and said with a smile: "It’s a master of the demon hunter, and you can see the blood."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Impossible! The sect of the family has the lethality and destructive power of you!" Elena recalled the horrific offensive of Su Ge and immediately shook her head and denied it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s smile did not continue, and said to Mill: “If this is the case, we must increase the protection of the palace. Their goal is probably something in the palace, or the majesty of the royal blood. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas seems to have fallen into deep meditation at this time, without speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mi looked at Vanas and didn’t talk too much on this topic: "Well, I will pay attention to this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina said here: "In the recent period, you try to avoid the people of Gis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Why?!" Hills looked a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina sighed: "In the recent period, internal and external troubles. The generals and parliamentarians who took the lead in the hands of Guice began to gradually get rid of their control. I want to completely vacant my majesty and gain the right to rule. Gis himself has been squatting for a long time, and he is trying to misbehave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Vanas returned Sighing: "Now the city is undercurrent, because I have been hiding in the palace, I can't communicate with the nobles. Many nobles have begun to dump with other forces. Now the only way I can contact the nobility is through the current deposit. Many members of the parliament and generals. But as they gradually draw on the aristocrats to control their rights, they naturally expand. Many of them who dare not think about it before, do not dare to come to the fore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For these people, I don't even know who is betraying, who hasn't defected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to this, Vanas looks sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina said: "It’s okay that the army outside the city has the commander of Greens and Becky, who are absolutely loyal to their Majesty, and Mastering the army and the militia, you can barely shake the guys who look at them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge brows slightly wrinkled: "Is it so dangerous outside?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the one hand, on the other hand, our mysterious defense system is too weak. The mysterious person in the palace is only me and Master Mill," Elena said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas nodded and said: "Master Mill needs to sit in the palace all the time to prevent the invasion of the monks and control the mysterious defense network of the entire palace. Although Elena is very powerful, her witch's identity is too sensitive to be used in public. Strength. Even if there are no three churches here, the fear of the witch is deep into the bone marrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A group of ignorant people!" Hills whispered Ramp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas spread his hands at this time: "So if I want to go out, there will be almost no mysterious people around."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge nodded after listening, and then asked: "If you have enough protection mechanism, can you convince the nobles in person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Of course!" Speaking of this, Vanas looked confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Vanas said in his heart: "Does the Pope want to protect me personally?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The situation is so complicated now, since the Polar Institute and the death sect want to catch the sire, we still don't rush out of the palace!" Elena made a suggestion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill shook his head and said: "If you can, you have to go out because we need to determine how many hidden means they have, and whether their goal is to squat or Royal Palace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That can't be used as a bait!" Elena was anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill leaned back on the sofa: "So my Majesty is still in the palace, not going out at once."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is silent, born and said: "I will come up with a solution to this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Vaneston’s heart was shocked and produced. Unlimited happiness and happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill said faintly: "I can find a way, but I want to warn you not to move those people of the Church of the Holy Blood."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "Do not worry, my people have nothing to do with the Church of the Holy Blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
