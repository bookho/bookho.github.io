			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge and Gujue talked for more than an hour. At about 11 o'clock, Su Ge stood up and said goodbye to Gu Jue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because two people have to go back to dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s my luck to know you," Sug said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gujue holds Su Ge’s hand and laughs and says: “To see you today, see each other and hate late.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where do you live now? How do you contact you later?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gujue said: "I haven't decided where to live now, but it doesn't matter. I believe there is a causal fate in the world, if you and me If people have a chance, we will meet again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, I turned around and settled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the pub, after two people bid farewell, Su Geyou squatted on the Arc de Triomphe and returned to his residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly’s face is red, but her eyes are sparkling and extraordinarily spirited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just drank a lot of wine, but because of the special constitution, there is no slightest intoxication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The guy should not be the one who belongs here," Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl did not ask this time, nodded slightly and said: "You are still smart, he can understand that he came here from other fields."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a special meaning in the mysterious world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different areas can be understood as different spaces, different systems, completely different worlds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug recalls the ancient words and demeanor, the kind of sprinkling and romance makes him somewhat familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Li Bai!?" Su Ge suddenly thought of this name that seems to be very old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is it true that there is another completely different world in the paradise on the cloud?” Su Ge’s heart suddenly thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two and a half years ago, on the Lunar New Year’s Day, when he talked with Bart, the bishop of the Green Flame Brotherhood, according to Bart, the world exists in the clouds. The legend of heaven, with mountains on the clouds, birds and monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This description is somewhat similar to the Susan impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Su Ge did not think much, thinking it was a legend between occasions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after experiencing these things, through the mouth of the storm Emperor Gwens, I know that the world has been shattered twice, and I have seen strange things like mobile phones, automatic rifles, etc. And some ancient idioms that are very incompatible with this era have given him great doubts about the location and timeline of the entire world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And today’s ancient feelings, whether from the surname, some words in words and deeds, the habit of drinking, etc., remind him of ancient China Those chic knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there still a big clear in the world!" Su Ge suddenly had a bold idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You seem to be thinking about something very interesting." Shelley looked up at Su Ge and said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug returned to God and coughed, haha ​​smiled: "Just thinking about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Shelly did not ask, everyone has their own secrets, and Su Ge never pursued her with preoccupation, and she would not violate Su Ge’s taboos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is respect for each other, this is a natural tacit understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back home, just to see Betty are happy to sing songs and pick peas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Snowy said, Betty seems to have a congenital aura that makes her look so happy, so lively, free . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, I am not ready yet." When they saw Sugg return, Betty stood up and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s nose moved and he could smell a fragrant smell of meat coming out of the kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said: "No hurry, I am tired, so come back early."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Betty took over Shirley's parasol shawl, the nose smelled a strong wine from two people, hung the clothes, she turned and said: "I am going to prepare the apple juice to sober up." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people take off their shoes and sit comfortably on the sofa. Shelly relaxes and lie down: "Tomorrow, let's try the blood bar?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg is still thinking about things, and he said, "Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time passed in silence, Betty prepared the apple juice and then entered the kitchen and continued to prepare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, a relatively rich lunch is ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main taste is fish sauce, barbecue, and soup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After lunch, Su Ge did not go out, but took a nap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a little drink, both people are a little sleepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I woke up, it was already three o'clock in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, I just saw a few sneaky people looking outside the house." Betty said nervously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squinted and asked casually: "Is it ordinary people? And it’s still a hooligan in the city."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!? How do you know?" Betty was shocked by the look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge drank a cup of coffee and sat down and said, "Don’t worry, it’s not just about our self-righteous waste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before hearing this, Betty was completely relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Zhong Ren is the embodiment of the great master in the world, and what he said must not be wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, Bernice got tired and went home. She took off her coat and lay directly on the sofa, looking tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you look at you, you should be annoyed by those who pursue it." Su Ge said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis nodded and looked dissatisfied and said: "One is really annoying, and I don't see what I look like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Bernice’s words turned and said: “To the grown-up, I heard Tsui’s saying that Green’s Admiral intends to build the fake hero and has begun. Packed through the media."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened to his face with satisfaction and pleasure: "Looking out, this general is quite sincere." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After other times, the four people sat together like family members, talking about the trivialities of life and some insights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley's rare initiative to share some of his own experiences and views of some inferior guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge also said a lot of adventures, and the two girls who listened were very fascinated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty said some of his past experiences and the trivial things that make her happy every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the flower of your own kind is opened. For example, the cleaning is very clean today. For example, when the barbecue is not a little bit of ambiguity, it seems that life is bit by bit. For her, she can make her very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis said some privacy issues between aristocratic ladies, such as which noble lady has four lovers, which lady is a social flower, and which lady is wearing a fiancé The green hat and so on, listening to Su Ge opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly discovered that these aristocratic ladies are playing more crazy than men, and they are too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sumptuous dinner was prepared by four people together, and Su Ge prepared his favorite and best grilled steak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley made a pot of not too good, but the fish soup tastes good, the atmosphere is peaceful and warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning at 7:00, Su Ge and Shirley are very Have a tacit understanding, wearing a loose sportswear in front of the yard for a simple morning exercise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge twisted his waist and sighed: "I think of Lobo a little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, let him think of the good days when he took the second hazel every morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s been much better than you." Shelly pressed her back and pressed her back to the chest of Sug, saying bluntly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second Erha has been staying at the side of Vanas, who is always fragrant and spicy, and has already married in groups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But according to Vanas’s report, few of the dog scorpions that were born were normal, each of them was a strange monster, and was quickly taken up by Master Mill. At the same time, research is carried out in secret cultivation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger said with a wry smile: "No way, who made me marry a wife like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley listened to his lips, his dark eyes with a smile, and screamed: "You haven't yelled at me yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is a matter of time." Su Ge is preparing to continue, the gloves in his hand flashed, and the appearance of the two changed instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because someone came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A total of six people, two police officers and four clergymen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who took the lead was the middle-aged priest of yesterday, Father Sini. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is Odin Assassin and Azshara Assassin?" Middle-aged policeman wearing a dark blue police uniform next to Father Sini Asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge put away his arms and said, "Yes, Father Sini, what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini said with a dignified face: "Last night Around nine o'clock, Father John and Moore were killed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge was shocked and then thought of the sentence of Shirley yesterday. Words: "They are going to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking is recovering between the electric and the flint, and Su Ge is the first salute: "I regret deeply for the second time."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police said a little coldly: "Because you and the two victims had some indirect friction yesterday, the two need to be investigated, and we will see the police."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Bernice, who was still wearing pajamas, hurried over: "Mr. Police, what happened to my cousin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The policeman looked up and looked at him with a sigh of relief. The cold face instantly turned into a smile and explained: "Miss Ferros, I am sorry, I need Your cousin will check the situation, please be assured that there will be no detention and it will soon be over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police have a good memory, he saw it a month ago. A few times this beautiful lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the lady was playing with the Admiral’s baby daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear, Bernice has a little peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said here: "Slightly waiting for me, we can't see people now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, you have half an hour." The police changed the indifference and said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest Sini is licking his ears again. The lazy guy in his memory usually only gives five minutes of preparation time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Humans are really dirty." Father Sini has already seen through, and his heart is full of boredom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this thinking, he is still a lowest-level priest at the age of 55. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
