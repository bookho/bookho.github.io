Adeline, who is sincere and happy, has a hoarse voice: "It is very sacred and very solemn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words are very appropriate, but they are not felt. A trace of feelings, people who listen to the incomprehensibility, very perfunctory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is someone else, the knights around have already swarmed, and the rifle mixed with lightning has turned Jerez into a horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Cavaliers have already got the relevant orders, and the memories of their lives let them know that this is a hunter without any feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge with a smile on the road: "Master Geros."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss head to face Look at Su Ge and nod. "What cost do I need to pay? Or, what do I need to offer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge Convergence smiles and says: "My Lord What you need is not your faith, but your loyalty and skill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss looked at Adeline aside and said seriously: "If you can Let me restore my emotions, I will contribute all my loyalty, technology, and everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge satisfied with nod: "Good, then, and I enter Temple, greet your new life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus still nodded very calmly, and after a look at Aideline, he entered under the leadership of Su Ge Temple of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple is still as solemn and solemn as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invisible pressure echoed in the temple, and when it came in, Geraldston kneeled on the ground and could not look up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows the horror of the gods and bows his head: "The great storm and the Lord of death, forgive my rudeness."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, no one replies to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the oppression of terror, he felt the indescribable power groping his body like countless tentacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even sliding through the skin on your blood vessels and internal organs makes people shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Gerlos was still calm, squatting, and motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold wind blew, Gerlos didn’t know what was coming to his side, he only felt a horror to an indescribable breath around himself. Next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows very well how terrible this breath is. If it is not the one who is in control, he can completely crush him with only these breaths. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown for many years, his body began to tremble and his heart began to accelerate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not from emotional fear, but from instinct as a creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point he is as stupid, although there is no fear, but there is nothing else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His brain is blank, and all knowledge and memory disappear completely at this time, like a newborn baby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, a violent and indescribable pain came from the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pain is heartbreaking, and he almost stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly returning to God, he was surprised to find a silver-white pistol piercing his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can feel that the pike pierced from his scorpion cover, squatting out, sharp to the indescribable gunpoint against his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still has no fear, not even feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you lose your fear, you will lose a lot of feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harsh friction sounded like the sound of a metal gun rubbing against his own skull, which made people feel terrified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, he felt that there was a tremor in the spirit of no fluctuations in the past ten years. After that, the tremor gradually enlarged, which made him feel an escape, fear a feeling of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this emotion, he looked at the ground dull, a feeling of comfort that did not know what it felt like from his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of long-lostness appears one after another, he knows, this kind of comfort, is happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt scared because his head was pierced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be happy because you feel scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he knows that the grace of the gods has been sown on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emotions have recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, he felt that he could talk, subtle excitement, happiness, trepidation, fear constantly echoing in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of Great Death and Storm, from now on. I, Gerlos Byron swears with my ancestors, my faith, my loyalty, my Technology, my knowledge, my soul, my flesh, everything I have will be yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go!" Su Ge's voice Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord said that from now on, you will be one of his apostles, taking Him to walk in the world, spreading His glory and divine power."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Apostles!?" Hearing this, the thoughts that have not fluctuated for more than 90 years have caused a storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Archbishop who has been in the church for more than a hundred years, he knows very well what the apostle represents and what a significant weight it has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contemplation, Gerlos has followed Su Ge to withdraw from the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continued: "The Lord's Royal will have four apostles, symbolizing the four apocalypses that the Lord has descended. Under the Four Apostles, there are eight conquests. The knight, symbolizing the eight powers of the Lord. Under the conquering knights are twelve foggy warriors, representing the majesty and divine power of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hills Bernice is now two of the twelve foggy warriors. The conquering knight is now only one, a high vampire called Randall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The number of church members is now, and the system is gradually improved. Adeline has the qualification to become a knight, and the Lord has already lowered the shrine, and will soon be blessed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The twenty-four preparations are the core and most important personnel of the whole church. Now I am going to come up with twelve places for the initial formation of the church.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, Su Ge said in a positive manner: "Master Gerlos, I hope that you can have enough outstanding performance to become the Lord's four great apocalypse. One of the disciples."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss pinched his palm, and there was a clear wave of unconfident confidence in the calm tone: "I...have this qualification?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, from your first encounter with me, the Lord’s eyes have been watching you. Your help to me, the Lord knows everything. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus's golden erect continually shimmered with inexplicable light. After a few seconds, he raised his hair with a hoarse and firm voice: "I will not I will live up to the expectations of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the best!" Su Ge looked satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, Adeline looked worriedly at this side, and her eyebrows were uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss is a demon-hunter with no feelings, she is very afraid that the Lord will feel disrespectful because of his blunt tone and no volatility, thus lowering the punishment . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the restlessness, her sight is exactly the opposite of Jellos, the familiar erection is in sight, without the icy and indifferent past, amber-like eyes With soft love and gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was full of white sly mouths with a hint of faint smile, and she knew that her great and merciful Lord had given her the greatest and most precious gift of her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a deep cry, and the distracted temperament rises in Adeline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she is not a little girl who is first love, she is very decent in controlling her emotions, respectfully salute: "Thank you, His Majesty the Pope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge puts his hand in his hand: "Your loyalty, and the goodness that Gerlos built before, let you have the reward of today, don't thank me, go with your heart Thank you for the gift of the Lord! I am just a bond that conveys the will of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people look at each other and smile at the same time, everything is in the air . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the old wife and his wife, calmly said: "The church system has been formed, but I will not announce it now. The Lord told me that One day in the future, our church will be hit, but this time the blow is not to destroy us, but to make us a new shell. We will take this opportunity to get rid of the sacred blood church and really enter this vast area. In the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this, Aidelin’s heart is screaming: “My lord is glory, and glory is all over the world.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adeline, then your task is more important. I let Bernice go to contact Glass, and judge that this general can be used for us. After all, Bernice is a little weak, you should take care of it. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! His Majesty the Pope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, in the emperor will follow The depth of the tie is deeper. In the future, the royal family and the Holy See will have a battle. That is our opportunity. We will not fight the unprepared ones."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned his head to Jerlos: "Jerousse master and I went up north to get it." The Holy Grail of Soul, this movement will be very big, and even cause big people, we must be prepared. I will confirm the message tomorrow, then you will take a step and determine the situation there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
