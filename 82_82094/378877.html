			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver stream flashed past and almost came to the front of the moon beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a regular moon beast soldier, where can resist the throwing of the Great God Declaration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, the rifle was pierced directly by the rifle, piercing the armor and piercing its fat body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! You damn bug, I want you to die!" The moon beast screamed, and the hand took a fist from the waist, like a grenade. s things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug saw a cold scream, his right hand slammed forward, and a five-meter-long huge fire column suddenly appeared, completely covering his claws and the grenade. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two seconds later, its left paw, together with the grenade, became an ice sculpture at the same time, falling into the ground in a slight trembling, and smashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell are you!" The moon beast asked hard, and the huge body fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see that the part pierced by the gun is centered, and a lot of cold has penetrated to freeze most of its body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great God Declaration as a mad hunting weapon not only has the power of storms and meteors, but also carries a hoarfrost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" The three cult leaders who were fighting were seeing their faith suddenly fall, and suddenly they made an unbelievable scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Duke of the Mountain Range, Lance’s massive spirit can be injected into the unrepentant determination, and the purple blade instantly turns into a clear sky blue The ripples of the lake like a lake are scattered, with a dreamlike brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, he snorted and the sword slammed forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the Duke of the Mountain, three meters away, was instantly cut into dozens of pieces and scattered all over the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this the light of the sacred tyrants of the tyrants!" Vegginia, who wielded a big sword in the distance, saw the sword. First, a sword killed a fanatic and wiped the blood on his face. Excited and asked aloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance’s shaking head: “No, this is called the lake full of light.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "There is no level in your name, the holy light is extremely sturdy!" Vegginia listened to a contempt, turned away and ignored the incompetent knight who could not even name the trick. Continue your own patties tour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance looked at Vegniya’s figure in the same place, not because he was in love, but because he felt his self-esteem was A serious blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One side of the mile first used a spell to make the approaching Oliver fly, and with his fingers in the air, a burst of light appeared around Oliver. Suddenly his mind was somewhat blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;趁This opportunity, Mill took out a piece of paper and slammed it on the sword, which was instantly filled with glaring thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped forward steadily, holding the sword in his arms high, with his shoulders on his shoulders, his shoulders with his arms, and his arms and swords slamming down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The legendary New Year's sword!!" Su Ge glanced at his look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sniper is very deadly, with the long sword of Lei Guang, the Oliver's spirit is alive and open from the head, until the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I kill..." Oliver returned to God at this moment and did not die, just yelling in his mouth, Mil experienced a silver glass ball I am lying on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, a glare of white light acts on his spirit, and the sacred white light directly evaporates its body by two-thirds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no..." Oliver’s eyes are full of resentment, and his long-cherished wish has been realized for a long time, but it has died at the end. before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance along the side saw this amazing saying: "It’s a master of the demon hunter, it’s really clean and neat, and it’s flowing.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of the Devil's core is the incomparable knowledge and understanding of the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They know the weaknesses and characteristics of each monster and develop the most efficient and safe killing method for this feature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill face is not very good at the moment, coughing actually brought out a lot of dark red blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you okay!?" Lance hurriedly asked him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill supported the body with a sword and said, "The problem is not big, don't worry about me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, there was a confrontation between Dr. Randall and Dr. Salo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this game is absolutely crushing, Dr. Salo’s summoning is a huge price, he has enough sacrifices in his hands, summoned A variety of weird insects, tentacles, mouths, etc. to attack Randall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these attacks were all defended by Randall through a positive defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time he lost his sacrifice, he used his body as a sacrifice, summoning a huge fist full of scales, but still blocked by Randall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment he was dry and lying on the floor with a weak breath, and stopped breathing without Randall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost one face, the fighting power here is completely crushed by Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no suspense in the battle outside. Those people are ordinary mysters who do not have much psionic power, and even many are not combatants, but similar to Iraq. Anyone who is such a researcher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the strange thing is that these people did not escape when they saw the hope of fighting, but they all took out a skeleton dagger and pierced their body. Collective suicide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill saw this face condensed and said: "The situation is not right..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companion The death of all people, Su Ge and others did not wait to catch their breath, the atmosphere of death in the whole space became more intense, and then the person who just died suddenly turned into a hundred dark spirits in the air, constantly screaming in his mouth What is said, people are upset, irritated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug! They use their own life as a medium, and they intend to dedicate us to the god of death and become a living sacrifice after the birth of the son!" Mill may have returned to the palace because of the cold tone gradually recovering some anxious tone. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people saw this scene, quickly gathered together, relying on each other carefully watching the situation around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. What should I do?" Randall is also a bit unpredictable at this time. After all, it is very likely that he will face a son of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the night of the town spread out, and everyone’s nervous heart was comforted and temporarily calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Duke of the Mountain in the state of the soul and Dr. Salo floated in the air, and said with a sigh: "Everything is ready, you become the son of this god." The nourishment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, all the souls began to roar, and the last breath of death near this brain filled the body of Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, an indescribable sense of oppression came from Vanas’s belly, and suddenly the entire palace became dead, birds, bugs, everything. The screams came to an abrupt end, and even everyone’s breathing was forgotten, waiting for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the oppressive atmosphere of death, everyone’s heartbeat begins to accelerate, and their eyes gradually widen, as if something strange and horrible is about to appear, but they have no courage to move their bodies. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time doesn't know how long it has passed, and a crisp, loud crying sounds through the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, the fallen leaves stagnated in midair, rapidly yellowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birds that stopped in the woods died and fell to the ground in an instant. Even the wind that had just blown out disappeared in the face of this crying, disappearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the palace, the nobility who was told not to step into the palace stood outside and comforted many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, everyone seems to feel something. The noisy square with tens of thousands of people is silent. Everyone’s expression is like a solidification. The eyes are bloodshot, the ears are bleeding, and the eyes are staring at the emperor. The direction of the city is motionless, just like a statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t know what’s going on, they’ve just heard a glimpse of the looming cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound is too subtle, and even a wind will blow him away, making people think it is an auditory hallucination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is the looming sound, just like the devil, instantly pinching the spirit and soul of these tens of thousands of people, making them filled with trembling and Frightened, I don’t dare to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, these people all turned white, pale to the ground, lost consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince of Jean, who has a higher vision, the Marquis of Raul and others trembled on the ground, and his mind was chaotic and messy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can’t think of anything at this time, only know that their vision has suddenly risen four points! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the edge of the altar, Suge stood there calmly, a translucent black shield that protected him and everyone behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, everyone’s vision has increased in varying degrees. Hills, Su Ge’s lesser vision, is six points longer. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Randall, Mill, this person has grown three points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s okay because of the effect of the night clock of the town, everyone’s mental state is not bad, although everyone is pale and shivering, but at least not Go crazy or faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t be afraid, the land is not afraid, the lively Hills is like a little girl who sees a horrible monster at this moment, shivering and trembled next to Su Ge, constantly shaking . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned to her and showed a gentle smile like a sun, using a meditation saying: "Don't be afraid, there is me."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
