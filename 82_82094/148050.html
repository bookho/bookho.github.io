			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a group of people drove to the street near the farm, they heard a faint scream from the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" Su Ge heard this suddenly gloomy face, and his heart was burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have said that this is my city, you dare to be so arrogant!" At this time, Su Ge first moved the real anger, open mouth Crude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not pay attention, and unconsciously, some of his thoughts have been brought into his own state of dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Retreat! Retreat!” At this time, a large number of policemen in front of them maintained order and dredged the masses while making it impossible for outsiders to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please take a step back. We are now in the process of destroying the cult. For the safety of the people's property, please try not to get close to it to prevent accidental injury!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, the directors of the two police stations in Chengdong and Chengxi stood together at this time, shouting loudly with a big horn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg didn’t have time to look at the police chief who had no chance to meet and whispered, “Go with me!”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Su Ge took out his own badge and led several people against the crowd to the police line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one is allowed to enter!" The policeman with a big beard said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After a fart!" Su Ge strode up and said to the bearded policeman: "Jack, I don't know anyone?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearded by the policeman, he looked at it with concentration and then a surprise: "My God, you can count it! There is a lot of trouble inside. There are quite a few The cultist..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Jack slammed Socrata in the past: "I just came a very scary vampire, the bishop is leading People besieged vampires!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The siege of the vampires!" Su Ge's inner heart continued to burst, and whispered to Jack: "These are all mysterious people behind me. It is the master of Gerlos introduced to me to deal with this matter. Let us Go in!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack is not a rigid policeman. After looking at the professional Bart and the mysterious Adeline, he immediately let the body say : "Go ahead! Be careful, I heard that a priest has already sacrificed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded, five people and one dog quickly passed the blockade line Follow the empty streets in the blockade area to the suburbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦啦......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When running, everyone heard a scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up, just to see the countless bats in the dark sky in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large amount of subtle electro-optic light appeared after a glare of large electric light flashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of electric lights suddenly dispel some of the bats in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline saw that the tone was not good: "Randall was attacked. That is the secret treasure held by Bishop Rhodes: Lei Zhi." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leizhi?" Su Ge said it was unheard of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline explained: "This is what Gerlos and I said. It was an ordinary iron tree, and it was later dyed. The blood and brain of the mysterious madman. After being smashed by lightning, there is a strange variation, which can generate a lot of lightning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bishop of the city!" Bart heard a dark sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge now has no time to study the secret treasure: "Jedel will not have anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This rest assured that as a high vampire is not killed by humans." Adeline explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded and stared at the battle over there. He squeezed his cane: "This ghost is really strong. You can lead Bishop Ron to Randall and let him think that Randall is also the Green Flame Brotherhood. People started the battle. All of the two unstable factors were delayed here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, you can count this step, you can still count Adelin and the two witches around me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain is running fast, Su Ge’s eyes are twinkling and whispering, whispering: “Try to avoid contact with the priesthood Personnel, meet those despicable intruders, don't let go, kill directly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Hills and Bernice open their mouths at the same time There was a chill in his mouth, and his face eagerly said, "Okay, the apostle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Adeline feels these two chills, Two eyes are shining in the eyes: "This is the power of that one!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the run of everyone Waiting, suddenly two shadows suddenly channeling out toward the crowd attacked over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out of the way!" Bart yelled, grabbing Bernice from the side and flashing back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another black shadow attacking Hills directly froze when he rushed to Hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark, two large and one small claws are caught together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small ghouls, be careful. Ordinary hunter bullets have no effect on them," Adelin reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ghoul has a human body, but has non-human big claws and feet. The skin of the whole body is festering and corrupt, without a nose, on the wide head. It is a mouth that can easily bite the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time he grasped the hand of Hills with one paw and the other hand held the neck of Hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the same, Hill's other hand is holding his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a witch!?" The wisdom of the small ghoul is very high, and the true identity of Hills is recognized at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills opened his mouth full of fangs, and the scarlet cock was staring at him hoarsely: "Go to death! Despicable invaders!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arm covered by the black scales suddenly made a force, and actually picked up the small ghoul's neck and lifted him up. Then he slammed it like a doll, and threw him out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul is very embarrassed, the moment he is thrown out, a roll is integrated into the darkness, turn and run! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another ghoul sees no hesitation and quickly integrates into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Want to run!?" Bernice had a glance, her arms swayed forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖嗖嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, three sharp knifes are shot like a string of arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a breath, the precise shot was behind the ghoul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a pity that the ghoul’s skin is very special. Even if these ordinary knives are not treated, they can’t break their skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two witches still have to chase, but they were stopped by Su Ge and said, "Don’t let them distract themselves. Our current purpose is the sacrifice of the law there! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adeline suddenly proposed: "If you leave it, you will definitely find trouble again. I will deal with it in the past and come over to find you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard this thinking: "As far as the current situation is concerned, even if Adele leaves temporarily, the problem is not big. There are two witches and Bart, and the battle is OK. Dispose of the two ghouls separately to prevent future bad things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Su Ge nodded and agreed: "Okay, speed to speed back "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the four people moved on, Adeline took out a crystal ball from her arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, cold-hearted church, it is our personal grievances." Said, Adeline's face gloomy disappeared into the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
