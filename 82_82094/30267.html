			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge opened his eyes, the first thing I felt was the whole body, as if all the joints were rusty and stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second feeling is that the body is cold, and there is an uncomfortable feeling in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's going on?" Su Ge wants to struggle, but finds that his control of the body is very weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the sky, Su Ge’s line of sight was instantly attracted by three huge moons in the night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the gods are screaming, large snowflakes are floating in the air, as if the angels were falling into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge reluctantly controlled his head and turned his head, blurring and seeing himself lying in a thick hay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's going on?" Su Ge felt that his memory had a fault and a desperate memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, the brain that seems to have solidified gradually returned to normal operation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A series of memory stars appear in Su Ge’s consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, I remembered. I was killed by a javelin." Su Ge thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge was an ordinary young man with a wide range of hobbies, commuting to work on time every day, playing games, visiting forums, attending some good clubs and the like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because parents have passed away, the typical one is full and the family is not hungry. Although not much earned, life is also leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way to work, there was a sudden heavy snow in the summer sky. When he was surprised, a quirky javelin fell from the sky and pierced his heart. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heart!" Thinking of this, Su Ge looked up hard and looked at his chest, and then looked strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he found that his clothes were wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before his clothes were a gray sweater blue jeans, but now he is wearing a black robes and trousers, sneakers on both feet It also became a leather shoe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, more eccentric memories appeared one after another and integrated into his consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug Sotos? The Undead Apprentice? The Death Sect..." A huge amount of unprecedented memory, previously unknown knowledge, and even language appeared in his mind in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a minute, Su Ge retorted: "This is crossing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The control of the body gradually recovered. Su Ge slowly sat up from the grass, raised his hands, and saw his own white hands without any blood, like a dead man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it life or death now?" Su Ge’s throat whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the memory of Suger Sotos, he is a mysterious lover. After graduating from college, he joined a cult called death sect and became An apprentice of an undead warlock is an undead apprentice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he thought he could gain extraordinary strength, but found that the undead warlock needed to be an apprentice, but a test. He did teach his knowledge to Su Ge, but the real purpose was to turn Su Ge into his own undead warrior. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days ago, he and his accomplices were ready to start their own evil experiments. They first killed Sog Sotos and wanted to turn it into their own undead warrior through their own spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the fact that Su Ge is still in the wilderness, he seems to have failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a beautiful and crazy world." Su Ge Sotos couldn't help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a steampunk world similar to the early days of the industrial revolution, steam engines have been widely used, steam trains, steam locomotives, even steam robots and steam gear guns have been Get popular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like the late Victorian movies that Sug saw, British gentlemen, mysterious and strange religions, cities surrounded by smoke, Gothic buildings, people struggling between superstition and science really exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, because of the real existence of mysterious Austrian law, the world has deviated far from the development of the earth world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Struggling to stand up from the grass, Sug moved his stiff body, reached out and touched his heart, then touched his breath, then loose The tone said: "Fortunately, I am still alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart is beating, the nose is breathing, it means that you are still human, not the undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This Suger Sotos is really naive. Death sect? Listening like a cult, throwing down your brother and sister, not working seriously, all day long Doing this, but also killing yourself? You are too irresponsible!" Suge said that this is not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family of Soge Sotos is just an ordinary working class, parents are cotton textile workers in the workshop, there are three children in the family, this year is twenty-four years old. Suger Sotos is the boss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four years ago, their parents died because of a factory accident. Although they felt that the sky was falling, they got a lot of money and they could make the three brothers keep the wolf from the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six months ago, he graduated from Suge University, but he didn’t learn well, he didn’t just go to work, but he didn’t learn what kind of church he joined without any skill. Everyday God’s way His younger brother and sister have not spoken to him for a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow in the sky is getting bigger and bigger, but the weird thing is that Su Ge doesn’t feel any cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pinching the skin, Su Ge nodded and said: "The touch is still there, indicating that the sensory nerves are still easy to use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it estimated that it has been missing for a few days? Hurry back, can't let your brother and sister continue to worry." Su Ge thought about preparing to go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Completely inherited the memory of Suger Sotos, Su Ge instinct has been influenced by him, instinct is very concerned about his brother and sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
