			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are your plans for these powers?" Su Ge asked Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas said in a sinking manner: "I want to try to solve it in a peaceful way. If it doesn't work, it will only let Grandpa Mille handle them all." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to this, Vanas’s eyes are full of decisive and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, I have to find a substitute for these people, which is why they can still live now." Vanas added a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug sees this smile and feels inexplicable demons and horror, but he does not feel fear, but has a feeling of like to appreciate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait! How can I feel this kind of evil smile?" Su Ge suddenly jumped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does my aesthetics and values ​​change quietly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina this He said: "Next, you will all live here to fix it. We will need to support each other for a while in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills Smile nodded, have a natural good feeling for this witch big sister. After the people talked for a while, Su Ge suddenly said: "There is a need to send additional staff to protect Connor. If those people have sharp points, they are likely to send them." The man came back to assassinate him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard this Vanas, he immediately stood up and said, "Irina, this matter is personally responsible for you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Your Majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Elena did not stop and left quickly . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill followed up and said: "Sug, you are now dealing with your related things, and later come to my mysterious workshop."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, Master." Su Ge said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is not a proud person, he will respect everyone who has knowledge of the world, whether he is a ghost or a ghost . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, if you want to deal with those people, Jim, who is a guard, is not expected to be trusted, then your safety will be greatly Threat." Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas nodded with deep agreement and then asked: "Is there any way for Mr. Sotos?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you believe, I can temporarily bring Virginia to you as a personal guard. Vegginia was an expert mysterious knight of the Glorious Church, and it is extraordinary. It is still female. You can protect yourself at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Vanas has no hesitation and says, "If that's the case, that's great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! Beautiful and noble Queen of the Night, if it can be your escort, it’s my pleasure." Vegginia didn't know when to wake up. Take off the helmet and reveal a striking blue hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she doesn't raise her hand and wipes the mouth of her mouth, this is a heroic knight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But your armor is too unsightly," Mill said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia immediately said: "This is not a problem, just take it off. If you don't meet men often, I am too lazy to wear this kind of thing!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?" Vanas blinked and groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills briefly said Vegniya’s past and immediately won the deepest sympathy and affection of Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill did not stop, got up and said: "If this is the case, then I will hand it over to you, I will go first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill went away, along with Su Ge and Hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia stayed here very generously, and did not think about his companion who made the evil dragon, which made Sears quite dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heavy color friends!" On the way back to Yaoyang room, Hills muttered his mouth and muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and reached out and touched her hair: "What color is light, both are women."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Su Ge returned to his noble and luxurious residence with Hills, and immediately saw the eyes of Hills straight, and returned to God for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This room is comparable to a three-bedroom house. After Sug arranged a place for Sears, Suge sat down to analyze the situation. Doorbell rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bedroom, a black suit like a sportswear-like clothing, Hills quickly ran over to open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Sotos is there?" There was a powerful female voice at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug walked over and saw a female soldier in a close-fitting armor standing in the doorway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Sotos, the chief of staff is in need of your help." The female soldier first gave a powerful voice, <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and said: "Just have time, let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then three people quickly left here, through two The promenade came to the third floor ward near the west side of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just arrived at the door of the ward, Su Ge smelled a burnt smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ward, Elena’s suspicious brow was locked and carefully looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened? Did someone attack?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina shook her head and said, "No, I always feel something peeping at me, then I found a weird thing under the bed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" asked Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina said: "A big rat, it was afraid of being under the bed at the time, so big, weird is that everyone else is watching No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wanted to catch it, but the guy ran very fast, rushed out and I wanted to burn it. The result was burned." Speaking of this, Elena scratched her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did it go?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina pointed to the corridor and said, "Running along there, I can't catch up. The soldiers didn't seem to see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That said, this is not a mouse." Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina blinked: "You mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is the Yi people." Su Ge said affirmatively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina shook her head and said, "It shouldn't be possible. The entire palace has a very perfect mysterious defense system. Due to the problem of the visual system, this system focuses on it. The defense of all the Dai people has been strengthened. If there are Yi people entering, the master of Mir must be aware of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge shook his head:" There is no absolute thing in the world. The Yi people from outside the world have been crawling from the abyss to the human world since ancient times. There are thousands of species, and what we know and incorporate into the spiritual system is only the ancestors. The experience is not true. Perhaps we know only a small part of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Elena nodded slightly, for humans, unknown Things seem to have no end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mention this topic, Su Ge sighed: "The world's human cognition is like a circle. When you know everything in this circle, you will I found that the outside of the circle is still the dark unknown sea. We only know a drop of water in this ocean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The more you expand the circle of your knowledge, As the circumference of the circle grows longer, the more unknowns you will encounter, the endless process of this process, and eventually fall into the abyss of fear and despair."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
