			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What sound?" Su Ge brows slightly, immediately launches his own psionic and spiritual vision, listening carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you a Sotos sect?" Just as he was listening to Su Ge, a voice with an old state and lack of confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge retired and turned to look at him, saw a black suit in a well-dressed, with a slightly short black sandalwood cane in his hand, spirit The old man who is shaking is standing in front of himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello! My name is Suger Sotos, this is the detective who came here to investigate the madness case," Su Ge temporarily put down the voice. Slightly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man nodded and looked around and asked: "Are you coming by yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge nodded and said: "Yes, there are more things in the police station recently. I can do this in my own case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man said after listening to the warning: "Then You have to be careful. Now that he is violent, ordinary people can't get close. I meant that you would bring a priest to appease Joseph's violent spirit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge took out the pendant on his chest and said with a smile: "Exactly, I am also a priest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! That's great!" A happy face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a group of people marched westward along the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a simple communication between the two people on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old name is Griman Stowe, not only the curator of the museum, but also the professor of the history department of Bain University. At the same time he is an expert-level historian, an old gentleman full of knowledge and courtesy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every historical artifact can actually speak, and the traces of the years on them are always telling us about the past glory and being drowned in time. The secret knowledge in it.” After hearing that Su Ge was also a Bain University student, the old professor was very enthusiastic about his own experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge smiled and nodded and agreed, but did not express his own advice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, he knows nothing about history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advance for about five minutes, after passing through a promenade, the pedestrian came to the west side of the gable warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time in this heavy black iron gate, there was a burst of struggling sounds and inhumane embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg instantly turned on the psionic power, and the eyes saw some ripples with strange stripes coming out of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this guy completely beast? The fluctuations and frequency of this sound wave have completely separated from the normal people." Su Ge was secretly surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really an eventful autumn, it’s crazy to go to this level, and it’s mostly affected by some mystery. It seems that my desire to easily settle is impossible. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The security guard here opened the door under the direction of Glyman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of the warehouse is not as dark as Su Ge’s imagination, but rather bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of tools in the wide warehouse for repairing artifacts, such as knives, plaster, iron powder, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high wall on the left has a lot of windows, just facing the sun in the south, the curtains have been pulled up, and the warehouse is very bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a weighing column in the middle, Sug saw the mad Joseph. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a young man who looks like a 30-year-old with messy blond hair and a lot of bearded faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was wearing a black suit at this time, but the clothes were full of dust and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body was firmly tied to the pillar, and for the sake of insurance, even the neck was strangled, the only thing that could move was only one head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But because of the violent struggle, his skin and rough ropes had been worn out, and the blood flowed out of the thick rope and his clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜! Hey! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Joseph, as reported in the report, did not think about reason. Before the green eyes were filled with madness and chaos, the turbid one had no focal length. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouth of the mouth is stunned, revealing the white teeth, and even the corners of the mouth are cracked because of excessive opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He screamed and bit his teeth while shaking his head, like a beast eating, seemingly biting something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing such a strange scenery, Su Ge’s heart is still somewhat imaginary, and the security guards on the side have been scared and pale, and their expressions are full of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Grieman was very calm and asked: "Can Sotos police investigate the cause of his madness?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge touched his chin and asked for a book and a pen: "Can you tell me about his identity and the latest situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gryman nodded and said, "No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Joseph is a painter, thirty-three years old this year He is very talented, but because the style of painting is too avant-garde and nobody cares, it leads to poverty. I accidentally discovered his talents and then invited him to the museum to help us identify some ancient paintings while assisting We have made some repairs to the damaged ancient paintings. He has been working here for two years. Although his personality is somewhat introverted, his interpersonal relationship is not bad, and his relationship with his colleagues is very good."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong with him recently?" Su Ge wrote down the key points and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grimman thought about it and said: "There is nothing unusual, normal commute every day. Oh, yes! He recently looked too bad, look It seems that I stayed up late at night. I asked about the situation. He said that he found inspiration and recently started painting again. He said that this painting will be the highest achievement of his life. This painting will attract worldwide attention and make him famous for generations. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
