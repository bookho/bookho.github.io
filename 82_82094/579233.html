			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three sisters were shocked and looked at the dissipated figure in the darkness, and blinked at the same time, feeling incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mysterious means of making them fearful is so dissipated? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prayers that seem to have no power by these sentences! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people in the shock are constantly moving and returning to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Bernice’s voice rang in the darkness: “With her courage, she dared not come again this evening.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the three sisters were able to return to God, looking at Bernice’s face in a sluggish manner, opening his mouth and not knowing what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis pulled the curtains to turn on the lights, and extinguished the incense burner under the gaze of three people. "What's the problem?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older sister took the lead in reacting, and the temptation asked: "Miss Bernice, you...have you borrowed the power of the great misty god to knock her back?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British holding the incense burner in both hands, carefully placed it in the side of the cabinet and said calmly: "This kind of garbage like a bug needs me." The divine power of the Lord? The tightness that has just repelled her is the scent of my Lord. You can understand it as a trace of invisible momentum."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, The three people looked at each other and couldn't understand what the temperament meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, when they looked at the graceful Bernice, they suddenly understood what it meant to be a temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, Bernice looked at the gray fog of the roof and gradually dispersed, and the depths of both eyes were full of piety and awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately half a year ago, the Great Lord summoned all the cadres and told them that they can now repel the enemy by praying to borrow the power of the Great Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, only those who hold the seal are eligible, others are not eligible for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve misty knights have the versatility of being the master of the fog with the great Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eight Great Archbishops have the power of storm and death with the help of the Great Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the four apostles can rely on the power of the great Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time she borrowed the power of the Great Lord, and the effect and power far exceeded her imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person who came is an expert mystery. My prayers have just been finished, and I have produced such a terrible power. It is worthy of greatness. The Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just felt very clear that with this scent of aloes as a carrier, she communicated the power of the great master by chanting prayers, then invisible The power of her body and psionic energy and the carrier formed an eye in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious person was hit with that eye and suffered a huge blow, and then completely collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to God, Bernice first communicated with his teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The performance is very good, they dare not continue to do it, they can bring them into the Kingdom of God, just this time the Pope is still inspecting the Kingdom of God." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Bernice returned to God and looked at the three men calmly and said: "Let's go, the lost lamb, now I am entering the Kingdom of God. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three men nodded after listening to awe and admiration, followed Bernice to the second floor room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saronic Ocean Cruise, sailing on the dark ocean . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cool sea breeze is blowing, with a special comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge and Shili were sitting on the chair by the bed at this time, the window on the side opened, the sea breeze blowing, and the black tea in his hand, elegant and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just Bernice used the power of my god through hunting." Su Ge tasted black tea, leaning on the chair and knocking on the legs. laid back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl said casually: "Is this something worthy of being shown?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge smiled and said: "It's not a showy, but a happy one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Happy, can you be able to work for this incompetent god?" Shirley brows Pick, with irony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people are similar in form, and she has an incomparable understanding of the situation of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge counterattacks: "Are you different?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哼!" Shirley Don't talk anymore, look out the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sighed and said: "I finally understand why you are desperately connected to the world."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl said casually: "I know the depth of things, you need at least five years to fully understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard There was no refutation in this statement. The level of thought of Shirley at that time really exceeded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My body is a nail, or an introduction. He is the link between the gods and the whole world. I am a foreign god and cannot access the whole world. In the rule system, but because I continue to have deeper connections with the world, the power of my gods will gradually appear in this world, thus establishing more communication. Over time, my nails are nailed. Deeper and deeper, one day, my god can fully access the rules of the world, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirle nodded slightly: "Yes, it is more convenient to add divine power. Although the gods are high-level life, they are not rootless grass after all. They are gods because some people believe in them and some people miss them. Without these beliefs And miss, they are just a group of higher creatures that are not dependent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The essence of the so-called belief is to miss, they must constantly ingest human thoughts to maintain their relationship with the whole world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard this smile "So, those gods are really fragile."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fatty is relative, at least they are less vulnerable than humans." Snow Lil said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded, no matter how fragile the gods are, it is also an indescribable horror in front of human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not all gods need to rely on humans to miss." Sherry suddenly took the initiative to say something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug 愣: "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Heart of the World." Shirley Say four words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Heart of the World? What is this?" Su Ge stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly’s face showed a thick smirk: “Do you really know?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Su Ge shook his head and looked at her curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley pointed to the glove on his hand and said: "The seven holy cups symbolize the origin of a world, wisdom, soul, temperature, sound, light and darkness. , element, life and death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In these seven sources, have you not found something less important?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg heard the contemplation and suddenly thought: "There is no container, no time and space."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley nodded: "Yes, you have also discovered all the gods from ancient times to the present, and there is no god of time and space."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened to silence and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master of time and space, the only ones related to these two, only Yugo Sotos, who is called the return of all things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The seven holy cups are nothing but the contents and decorations of the whole world. The real core is time and space. The concentration of time and space is called the center of the world, because that is the origin and foundation of the world. Without these There is no point in having something more than the source of the Holy Grail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you understand that it is the eighth holy grail?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley shook his head: "No, it is the ruler of the Seven Holy Grail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge heard this deep meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, he asked out, "So what is the relationship between the heart of the world and the human faith?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley gave a look at Su Ge: "Are you stupid, or stupid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg thought, seriously: "It's stupid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Giggle..." Looking at Su Ge’s serious statement, Shirley didn’t know why, suddenly it was very pleasant. Laughing, and then very generous explanation: "The heart of the world is the embodiment and concentration of time and space. It contains all the time and space, and naturally includes everything. It does not need these people now. It can take all the things you need through the past and the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And time and space are the same everywhere, use The ancient saying of your humanity is a law, a law, and the heart of the world connects all the time and space, not just the world, even There may be other worlds, even all the worlds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this Su Ge suddenly widened his eyes: "This is the true heart of the world." , the heart of all the world, the center of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley took a slapstick look at Su Ge and asked: "Why, after knowing this What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge touched his chin and said, "It’s very shocking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
