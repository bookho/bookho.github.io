			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug sat on the throne and looked down on the two, nodding slightly but not saying much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision of the gods looks at the situation of two people now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s almost the same as I imagined. It’s the soul of two people who summon two people through dreams. However, in this soul, there is still The same sarcoma on the flesh. This means that the sarcoma is not purely physically present, but rooted in the soul to grow, and after it is completely integrated with their souls, it begins to grow physical structures on the flesh." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pinching the pistol in his hand, this gun has the power to break the mysterious rules. But in the eyes of Su Ge, this gun can't help two people, because the sarcoma has merged with the souls of two people, destroying the sarcoma, and both people will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can't do this, try it through the storm hunting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge Thinking, after a minute of silence, I said, "My servant, I am so convinced, I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people are very happy, but Did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your piety, your loyalty will be exchanged for gifts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Su With a big hand, I picked two from the foggy hunting of the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two hunting prints were suddenly enlarged after they were assigned, forming a circle that rose from the ground and wrapped two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will give you great knowledge and powerful power. This power allows you to integrate into the normal life and let you control yourself more steadily. The power can make you get a new form."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the two people suddenly became shocked and then said with a look of fear: "The servant is afraid, you The gift is too vast, we..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To you, you have such qualifications on your behalf." Su Ge said lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the soul, the two men were full of gratitude and adoration: "Our servants will carry forward the glory of my Lord and never let the gift of my Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge nodded slightly and continued: "My apostle, Su Ge Sotos is ready to build a church that spreads the glory of the Buddha, he will replace all of my affairs in charge of the world, and the two of you will Fully assist him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes! I will wait for the servant to do my best to assist the apostle." The excitement of the two people can no longer be described. Use your words to say your determination in plain words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge breathed a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have almost no substantial combat power now. If these two witches can use storm hunting to become normal people, it is a huge for my safety." The promotion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end of the mind, Su Ge’s pretending is also over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go on!" With a big hand and a wave, the two people suddenly felt surrounded by the blue aura. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, two people get up at the same time and look at each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After determining each other's thoughts, the two people suddenly felt the body was extremely cold, and the chest began to appear indescribably severe pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold and pain of the bones caused the two to clench their teeth, while the worn-out sweater pulled out of the chest and looked down at his round and straight chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, two people saw the middle part of the two men's breasts at the same time, and an ice blue prototype mark appeared in the area under the collarbone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This imprint is a ghost wolf made up of frost, which is exactly the same as the one you see in your dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the imprint appeared, countless weird thoughts poured into the minds of two people, and two people screamed and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Su Ge got up early to clean up his instrument. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is about to start work again, as a priest and a detective, at least not in the way can not give people a bad feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With some worn hats, Sug whispered with a cane: "When you have money, you must change your body."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After touching Lobo, I walked out of the house. Today is a big sunny day. When I see this kind of weather, the whole person is much refreshed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know how the two of Hills are doing, but now I don't have time to look at them, I hope they can withstand the effects of storm hunting!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation of the witch is not clear, and Soge does not intend to rely too much on others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Others are foreign objects, they can't always be used by themselves, and their own promotion is the most reliable. The next smooth time I want to do everything I can to become a formal cleric of the church even if I have to pay some price. Then I can have enough means of self-protection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The attack last night made Su Ge suffer a huge stimulus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, last night I attacked a apprentice who was not very good-spirited. At present, there are only some melee combat abilities, just deformed by the cane. Restraint. If you have a mental attack, or a thoughtful assassin, swordsman and other occupations, then I can completely die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Thinking of this, Su Ge slowly squeezed his cane, and his eyes flashed for a while: "The main goal now is to become stronger at all costs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten Minutes later, Su Ge came to the police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just entering the police station and waiting to sit down, I saw Jack rushing past and saying: "There are cases!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge spirit shocked: "What case?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
