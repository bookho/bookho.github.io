			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing the mountain, Su Ge changed the topic and asked: "How much do you know about the situation in the capital?"<br /><br />&nbsp Cody shook his head: "I don't know the situation there, but I heard that the newly appointed Queen barely managed to maintain the old kingship. After all, the Royal Guards are not vegetarian. But now because of his brother's manufacture." The werewolves that came out were still raging in the country. The overall public opinion was biased towards the imperialism. The rest of the people had little support for the original royal family. Now there is no collapse, relying entirely on the rich heritage of the former state treasury." Hug nodded and asked: "Can people still see his brother lead the werewolf in the country?"<br /><br />&nbsp Cody shook his head and said: "No, he has never appeared after killing the king and messing up the whole country. Only a large number of werewolves have been killed. I used to live there." After the rise of the war, we heard that it was very safe, so I moved over here, but I did not think that ...... "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Speaking of which, Cody choked voice, bowed his head not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly, and with Cody’s words, he had a preliminary understanding of the overall situation here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you tried to find your child in the mountains?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cordy nodded: "Look, I have been there many times, but they have been returned by the soldiers patrolling there. I can feel it if I continue Not only can you not see my children, but they may even kill me at any time, and then they will not continue to contact them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this Suge deep The tone said: "Mr. Huntington, the deal was established. I will help you investigate your son's situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you very much." Cody hurriedly stood up and bowed salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "You tell me in detail about the location of the cave and the youngness of your child."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My child is Bieber Huntington, 12 years old, about one meter long and five feet tall, not fat or thin, blond hair..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter half Hours, Cody carefully described the look of his son and the location of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that there was no omission, Sug sent Cody away and took out his pocket watch to see the time, it was already three o'clock in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Action after the sun sets." Su Ge thought about closing his eyes and falling asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the whole process of action and action through the mind of God, Su Ge found several key points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First: You can't walk completely according to Cody's route, because today's situation, Cody's words are not very trustworthy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second: It is very likely that you will be attacked by both mystery and physics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third: There is a good chance that there will be some connection with the followers that Jean brought back, ready to meet the werewolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Ge opened his eyes again, time has come to six o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug up sat up with a backpack and took out some mysterious material to make two murders for investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will make the magic close up, make sure that there is no problem with the equipment, then put on a relatively loose black casual dress, Su Ge turned and went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first simple meal was a six-minute dinner, and Su Ge gradually disappeared into the darkness with the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s route is still following the route given by Cody, but the position is shifted to the left by about 50 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the road ahead is much harder, it is relatively safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pull up the collar to cover the face, Su Ge will let the magic out, and center on himself, half a catty and 20 meters for circle detection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the foot of the steady stepping on the relatively steep slope, Su Ge's body carefully moved forward, like a hunter who was tracking the prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After about twenty minutes of advancement, Su Ge stopped his body because his enemies felt that someone was approaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually lowering the breath, Su Ge listened carefully to the sounds around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today, the foreign businessman seems to be in contact with Cody?" Some sharp voices came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the rescuer's eager Cody estimates that this route has been told to the poor worm." Another relatively normal voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the businessman is really a church person, it is estimated that he will come here, we are both ambushing here, even if it is a mysterious person, a shot Exploding his head, I don't believe he can live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I also think that those things are just making a fool, but using some chemical reactions. And physical means, and those juggling are no different. You look at the people inside, one by one, and the ordinary people are no different, the a few days ago, the crazy mysterious, let us go through the bullets The sieve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hide well, he should be coming, I have feelings!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After that, the entire hillside was completely quiet, and occasionally I remembered some awkward howls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge hiding in the hillside depression closed his eyes, and then the bells in his mind rang, forming a faint ripple that spread around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ripple is very subtle, and it is Su Ge’s advanced skills for the bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subtle ripples allow the same level of mystery and ordinary people to perceive any mysterious waves and sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the radar's sound waves spread out, there were two points in the numerous circles in Su Ge's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two points are in their own one-clock direction and four o'clock direction, the distance is 12 meters and 7 meters respectively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that two people are hiding on both sides of the road, waiting for me to come." Determine the position of the two people, Su Ge opened his eyes and pondered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you need to deal with it? I can easily go around in the current situation. But if you are chased down on the way down the mountain, these two guys are very It's easy to be bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Handle it, but don't kill it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Killing It doesn't feel good. When it's not necessary, Su Ge won't choose to be human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this Su Ge once again released the bell. The ripples of the bell were bigger, and Su Ge launched his own hypnotic ability as a god official. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the people on both sides of the intersection heard a very illusory bell, then squatted and leaned against the tree on the side to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no two hours to wake up, these two hours are enough." Today's Su Ge is no longer a fledgling rookie, for the mysterious grasp Ample confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running and throwing away two people, Su Ge quickly progressed, and at the same time made the situation carefully by making the devil carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about ten minutes, Su Ge came to a relatively gentle forest and found two large stones that rolled down the hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where Cody’s son, Bieber, hid when he saw the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the vision, Su Ge swept his eyes and saw a lot of mysterious traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are no runes, no spells, as Cody said, those things are passing." The eyes followed the mysterious traces to the hillside, stretching forever. On the other side of a hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The route is correct." After confirming, Su Ge continued to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A large number of dead people... There are many ways to control the body on a large scale, but most of them are from the book of the Necromancer... The Book of Necromancer, Black Robe People!?" Su Ge thought of this spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
