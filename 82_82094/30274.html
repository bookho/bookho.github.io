			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bern City West Police Division, Interrogation Room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge quietly sat in the chair, opposite him was a majestic police officer with a national face, and just two of the demon hunters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be nervous, say everything you know. We are not the accomplices of the cult!" The blond-faced face police officer said solemnly and eloquently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This police officer is the deputy minister here, called Orson Sith. He is a celebrity in Bain City. He has broken many cases and is enthusiastic and upright. He is called "a partner of justice" by the people at the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and said: "I am a occult enthusiast who joined the organization called Death Decade about six months ago and they said that I can get it. The power of mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recorders on the side seriously remembered that the two demon hunters were silent and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was learning mysterious knowledge under the name of John Rose, when I met Jess several times, Jess and John Ross. The relationship is very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Over time, I gradually discovered that those people did not teach others mysterious knowledge, but used us as guinea pigs. About a few days ago, John grabbed me with the help of Jess and wanted to refine me into John's undead warrior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this The two demon hunters leaned forward and came to the interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ossen nodded and continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I felt that I was really killed by two people in the water and lost consciousness. I didn't know what happened afterwards, but suddenly I was last night. I woke up in the wilderness of the western suburbs. I don't know what happened, I don't know why I didn't die, I don't know how long I have been in a coma. I thought I could get back to home through this connection with the sect of death. I reported that I was going to the police station to dismiss the case of my disappearance. I wanted to report the evil organization to the police station."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Speaking of this, Su Ge said with some nervousness: "But at the door, I saw Jess. I was even more afraid. I was afraid that there were other accomplices in the police station. I was hurriedly fleeing, and then I fled. The two hunters have known."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ossen has listened to the two hunters who simply said the experience of the two sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You just said that you can hear the voice of the deceased?" Orson asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s brows said: “I’m not sure what the sound is, but I did hear it.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ossen asked again: "Do you remember the place and location of the death sect?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, if in safe conditions Next, I can take you there," Su Ge said hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you remember members of other organizations?" Orson asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and said, "I still remember some, but I only know their names, I don’t know their identity. Some people just met, even the names. I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Ossen looked satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important key points are finished, and the next question is the details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire question lasted for more than three hours, and colleagues also had portrait sketches of those who did not know the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two hunters did not say a word, the whole process of Orson is singing a one-man show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everything is done, Orson looks at the thick confession: "Mr. Sotos, thank you for your help. Your confession for us." It is very important. You can rest assured that our Bain Police Department will fully protect the safety of you and your family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s face is assured: "Thank you, Secretary Sith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You wait here now." Orson said with two hunters to go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the door of the interrogation room, Ossen asked with respect and respect: "Mr. Gerlos, is he really saying what he said?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One face white The bearded middle-aged hunter nodded and said, "It's all true, it's worth trusting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ossen breathed a sigh of relief and said: "Then we Go and deploy now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go." Gerlos said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes! Then the next person will be handed over to you." Orson said quickly and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interrogation room, Su Ge Chang Shu sat in a chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process of interrogation is very uncomfortable and subject to tremendous mental stress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling behind Su Ge is full of sweat, and the clothes stick to the skin very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No one will reveal your own secrets, so you can use the power of the police to dispose of the death sects as quickly as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What I need now is time. I still have a lot of secrets to mine. Give me some time. I should be able to find some self-protection ability." Su Ge clenched his fists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the door opened again, the green-haired young hunter said: "Let's go, change a place."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The status of the two demon hunters is very high. In the police station, it can be said that there is no one to come to the third floor to entertain the VIP room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on a comfortable, soft sofa, Suggton didn't want to get up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First introduce yourself. My name is Gerlos Russell, a master of the demon hunter." Gerlos said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge was suddenly surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master is not a respect, but a symbol of knowledge and strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power system of this world is quite special and divided into nine levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apprentice, expert, master, lord, dominator, sage, legend, immortal, great god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This level is not only applicable to ordinary combat occupations, but also applies to all aspects of lawyers, workers, accountants, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This level is not based on combat effectiveness, but is based on a person’s knowledge and reserves in a certain area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the master level, in the world view of Su Ge, the whole world includes warriors, archers, hunters, arcans, accountants, lawyers, etc. There are only a small percentage of the number of people inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that any profession at the master level has a huge influence, is a well-known figure in a certain field, and is respected by everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss continues to introduce: "This is my apprentice, Warren Acheson."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Hello, Dear Master, thank you for your help." At this time, Su Ge stood up and bowed, and took out his 100% respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not fear and flattery, but from the heart of respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus nodded slightly, accepting the respect and gratitude of Su Ge, saying: "Sit down, don't be nervous."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg listened to respectfully sitting down, but never just lazy, the waist is quite straight, and the look is right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much is your spirit?" asked Gerlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge closed his eyes and then said truthfully: "10 points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After just hearing the voice of the deceased, Su Ge’s vision increased a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warren on the side said: "This is far beyond the scope of normal people. Even after 10 or more points, it is impossible to change back to ordinary people. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
