			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart continues his explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to our predecessors who fled back, the people who came to the city at that time were generally master-level, and the combat power was far better than the master of hunting. Jerouss. Needless to say, it is only the master singer of Longyan believers who can summon the dragon's breath after singing and can directly destroy half of the hill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes jumped and his face was dignified and said: “Is this a bit too exaggerated?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart’s smile: “Really It is more exaggerated than what I have described. However, measuring the strength of a mysterious person is not to see his destructive power. For example, the singer is the first person to die at that time."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mystery is called mystery because he is magical and secretive enough to be understood and understood by normal people. I told you about the mysterious duel tradition, you should also have Experience. The battle between mysteries is the collision of knowledge and rules, the higher the mysterious duel, The less the bad force. Even a duel, a whistle, a sign language, a look is finished, but it is mixed with the danger of death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When it comes to this, Bart looks at the right color: "The mysterious duel usually does not keep hands. When it is divided, it is also born and died. The failed person usually dies very badly, the whole body rots and the death is the most Fortunately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug recalls the last time he was attacked by the Green Flame Brotherhood's hypnotist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two did not even face up, he did not even know who the opposite was, but the opposite had already forced himself into the desperate situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deeply agreeing and nodding, Su Ge frowned: "You can kill so many master-level characters overnight, what kind of person is that?" The realm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart shook his head: "You don't think too much about the master. For the mystery, the master is just the threshold. Master The realm of the realm is the true mystery of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four ratings of Apprentice, Occupation, Expert, and Master are the usual levels for all professions today. But the rating above the master can only deal with the mystery, do you know why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge thought about it and quickly ran his knowledge: "The limit of occupation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The essential difference between mysterious occupation and normal occupation is that the upper limit is closer to Unlimited, and ordinary occupations have limits. For example, a master of bread can be superb in his technique, and there is no supernatural phenomenon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this Sugerton came to the spirit and asked: "What is the realm above the master? I only listen to the masters mentioned by Master Gerald."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad sinking For a moment, I still explained: "You should not go deep into this question. The reason why the realm above the master is not known to ordinary people is because the name called the realm contains horrible knowledge and rules, even Names with several realms cannot be expressed in human language."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded after listening, and he saw them in the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can simply tell you about it now, the realm above the master is the lord, the lord is the sage. As for the dominator, this pronunciation is not Accurately, when Gerlos said it should be a temporary change of pronunciation that is convenient for you to understand. I can only say this in terms of realm, and the name of the realm is not suitable for you now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and did not force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say, after those people are slaughtered? Did the maze guard find it?" Su Ge returned to the topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart shook his head: "This is not very clear. All the legendary maze guards have been imprinted with vows of runes, giving strange powers. Becoming guards After that, they went beyond the human form and entered the mysterious and strange form. Otherwise, he would not escape so far under the pursuit of so many forces."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Su Ge nodded and expressed approval. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is not much turmoil in the follow-up of this matter. The mysterious personnel here lost too much. At that time, only Ron Bishop and a night watchman were left. Others The demon hunters, the exorcist, the sinners, and the March apostles were all killed. Just two years ago, Gerlos was transferred here and temporarily guarded here."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge did not speak, and it was difficult to call his brain with a small amount of capacity to accommodate these messages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, there is one more noteworthy point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"< Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At that time those people broke into the interior of the Church of the Holy Blood and all the way to the library of the Church of the Holy Blood. After that, I don’t know why, everyone is crazy. Run out and talk about what I see inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the library that protects the non-combatants of the Church of the Holy Blood." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart jumped: "The library has a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk At the time, two people have followed the street to the empty financial square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy snow is still falling, and the empty squares give people an indescribable silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s all about saying that, and I should go." Stop, Bart said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge returned with a smile: "This time I don't know when I can meet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you will meet soon!" Bart said easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sughaha smiled and reached out as a parting handshake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wish you all the best in the church and strive to become the central archbishop as soon as possible." Bart sent his blessings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said with a smile: "I also wish you an early glory of the Archbishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Thank you, Ji Yan. Oh! Right, if there is any need in the future, you can go directly to Jike, he can contact me, our cooperation relationship still exists."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end, Bart turned and walked at a very brisk pace, seemingly far from Su Ge to make him very relaxed and happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
