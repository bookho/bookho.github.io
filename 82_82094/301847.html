			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, when Su Gesu woke up, he found two things in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left hand is an exquisite black leather glove, exquisite workmanship, seamless, black and shiny, looks very thin and full of texture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a white six-pointed star on the hand, and the white lines have subtle raised shading, just like the frost on the glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glove has a short entrance that just covers the wrist of the wrist and looks like a normal gentleman's leather glove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sat up and put the glove on his right hand with a blank expression. After a flexible palm and fingers, he looked satisfied and his mouth tilted slightly: Although things are very inferior, but now it is barely worthy of my identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, Su Ge’s eyes were full of struggles, and then began to Squinting, the expression is faint...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten meters, Su Gewan began to breathe vigorously like a nightmare, and the sweat on his forehead . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, just use it once, is the effect so deep?" Su Ge paled and the shock was undecided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was awakened, Su Ge felt that his human side seemed to be completely suppressed, and was completely locked out in the deepest mental cell. For the control of the spirit and the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of fear and despair makes Su Ge feel like he is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too dangerous, be careful in the future, be careful, or two more times, I guess it won’t come.” Su Ge thought, The will to not use the body is more and more determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add a meditation to yourself, Su Ge calms down, feel the glove of his right hand, very comfortable, very close, very soft, like using top materials, Like the high-end gloves made by the top tailors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course this is a superficial phenomenon, deep, Su Ge can see two thin white lines extending from the six-pointed star along his arm and shoulder, link Go to your left chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, his ice heart and gloves, like the two matching parts, are completely connected and echo each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling his control over his abilities, Su Ge nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ability to use that immune attack is somewhat expensive. It can only last for two seconds at a time. The cooling time is full for one day, and it consumes half of my psionic power. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After determining the gloves, Sug saw another thing around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A skull with no squat and a rounded shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale skull was frozen by a layer of ice that could not be melted, and it looked very ordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Sug is very clear that as long as you input the psionic energy to activate, these ice will instantly turn into a blazing ice flame, taking the lives of others while bringing The coldness of the cockroach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not activate immediately, took the skull and measured it, and found that this shrinking skull that has been polished by the gods can be placed without affecting the body shape. In your own pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the thinking of the gods is a little scary, I have to say that this thinking can cover all aspects, and even I have thought of it for me to carry it. Steps.” Su Ge tied the belt and pocket, and exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two biggest cards are packed, and Sugerton is full of information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With this equipment, even if I face a master mystery, I am not afraid!" Su Ge's heart is a little inflated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wash was finished, Su Ge had just dressed and called Hills to prepare for dinner, and the door rang again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is still the female soldier yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Sotos, not good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the door rang Directly pushed away, the female soldier said in a panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge picked up his cane and asked, "What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female soldier was pale and panting and replied: "I don't know why, for all the reasons, near the ward." Life and nurses are crazy! Now running around, seeing people bite, playing can not fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go!" Su Ge listened to the body and rushed straight Go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been to the ward several times and is now familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be the first to run ahead, when he turned around, he just saw two soldiers rushing over: "Mr. Sotos! Help us! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two soldiers were pale and fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked up and looked forward. A nurse with blood in his body turned white and was running fast in the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nurse has at least a dozen shots, but the body is agile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Zombie? But this zombie is running a little faster." Suge said calmly, under the gaze of the three soldiers, a walking stick, a cane belt With the sound of the wind, the accurate pumping of the neck of this female nurse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘎嘣! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the broken bones suddenly sounded, and the two legs couldn’t help but tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the female nurse’s neck was broken at a scary angle and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling! Just as the three soldiers had just breathed a sigh of relief, the nurse actually stood up again, and continued to rush forward and grab the Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head has not been lifted, but it still does not affect her actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, the two male soldiers immediately rose two points, then turned their eyes and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining female soldiers shook their legs and could not stop shaking, trembled on the ground, pale as paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't watch." Hills then reached out and grabbed her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! I want to see! I want to overcome myself, look directly at these fears, and then avenge them!" Fear of fear, but the will and determination of the female warrior Unbelievably firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Su Ge opened his mind and looked at it, and later found that the nurse’s body seemed to have a weird bug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The worm that can be seen by the visual vision seems to be something in the system of the vision." Su Ge thought that this was a hypnosis to the nurse. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is no effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This mass career is really rubbish!" said, Su Ge rang the night clock in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a bell, the nurse’s body was first stiff, then plopped down on the ground, motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or my hidden career is reliable!" Su Ge had a smug look on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills whispered forward: "This should let me come, I can easily unload her limbs so that she can't move."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In case she continues to climb with her chin? Do you want to scare these ordinary people?" Su Ge said, kneeling down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills turned to look at the female soldier who had been frightened and couldn’t stand up, spit out his tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, Elena ran over and there was still a faceless Marvel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's let me burn her!" Elena said that her palms began to turn red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug hurriedly waved: "Don’t worry, she’s already quiet, don’t let the key evidence go.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
