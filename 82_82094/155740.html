			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Gesu woke up, he first felt that his chest was heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your eyes, the first thing you feel is the bright sunshine shining through your glass on your face, warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is this?" The eyes swept around and saw the bedroom that was very refined and warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly raised his head, Su Ge just saw Ada squatting deeply in his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ada?" After seeing Ada, Su Ge was even more aggressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada, who feels Sugg’s awakening, opened his eyes, and after two people’s eyes were opposite, Ada suddenly opened his arms and hugged Su Ge’s cry and said: “The goddess is on You finally woke up! I have to worry about dying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s hand hugged her and smiled and said: “Nothing, I Very good, don't worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have to be careful later, what are you going to do, I will feel bad." Ada touched Touching the tears, a look of true color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugton was a bit distressed, and then a positive response: "Do not worry, Ida, I will not worry you later."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enn!" Ada nodded and was satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sat up and asked, "Where is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada replied: "This is Mr. Bart's private apartment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bart's private apartment!?" Sug stunned, screaming, the memory of last night was like a dyke The floods roared like you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember that Randall took Hills and Bernice from the sky, and then exploded, and Randall took the lead to form a barrier protection. Everyone, Longhua's Hills hugged me to help me block a lot of shocks, after that... the memory was a bit fuzzy." Su Ge held his head and his brow was locked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you okay?" Aida asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug shook his head and suddenly asked, "What about the other people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai I will briefly talk about what I saw last night and the things behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is Jick sending us out from here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada Nodded, some tweaked and said: "I was still connected with my generation. I was very embarrassed at the time. It was a group of good people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge hurriedly asked: "So... what happened to those people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was afraid that Ada would see the real identity of those people and bring her in. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These people were fainting at the time, they should have been assigned to other rooms. I have been here with you since I came, not yet I know the situation of other people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this Su Ge’s heart sighed and asked: “How did you get to the farm?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard people say that the farm is on fire, and I heard the explosion. When you left, you said that you went to the farm. It hasn’t come back for more than two hours. I am worried about you. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a while, Ada’s eyes are red again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug rushed to apologize: "I'm sorry, it's not good for me, it's not good for me! I won't be in the future!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge hurriedly changed the subject and asked, "What about the black man?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada said with a puzzled look: "Black man? I didn't see it. When I came, you were lying here and didn't move. I didn't see anyone else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this Su The brow was locked: "I didn't see anyone else? The black man was going to take me away. How did he suddenly let me go? Is there any conspiracy? Is there a high man who secretly helps?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to his words and demeanor, there seems to be no follow-up conspiracy. It was true that I said that I would take it away. Then the reason why I can see it after I came, may be who he should have been. The attack was either deterrence, and then no other direct escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which person can deter or drive away a person with 88 points of vision, hand-held What is the mysterious power of the 6th-order magic book?" Sugue thought that there was some uneasiness in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he found out at this time that the real situation of the city is much more complicated than he imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door rang when contemplative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada wiped his eyes and turned to open the door, saw Adeline standing with Randall two people standing at the door, smiling when they saw Ada Said: "Hello, how is Mr. Sotos recovering?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada smiled and said: "It is already awake, it looks nothing. "Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge got out of bed and asked, "How are you recovering?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline smiled: "I have no problem. It was just a blast that was really dizzy. The problem is not big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall A smile: "I am the same, just fainted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge nodded with relief and randomly gave Ada a little helplessness: "This The two were police detectives who came here from other cities. We teamed up yesterday to investigate the fire on the farm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada nodded and turned Looked at the time and said, "I am here. Going to church, but also going to see the situation of those farms, can you let Mr. Bart send me a ride?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack standing at the door I heard immediately and said, "I am happy to be a beautiful and kind lady."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada turned to look at Su Ge as if the big sister’s warning said: "You have Your job, I know this is the secret of the police, I will not ask. But you must assure me that you must protect your body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Su Ge took her hand and nodded hard: "I swear, Ada!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada looked away with Jike and quickly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Ida left, the three men sat down and looked dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is that person?" Adelin frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall shook his head: "I don't know, this thing is very strange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge was still calm at this time and asked: "Randall, talk about the situation you encountered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was rushing to the farm, but The church members who were rushed in the sky found that those people were very difficult to get around. After being hit by that weird thunder, I couldn’t get rid of it, I could only fight. Fortunately, they didn’t have too many people, I hit them. When I retired three times and was about to leave, suddenly there was a violent explosion in the air. I took the opportunity to leave the battlefield. After I found you on the road, I met Hills and Bernice who had just been killed by the police. I took them with them. Flying over, I encountered an explosion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge held his chin and fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is behind the black hand is affirmative, but who is he, what is the real purpose? Operating for so long, spending so much manpower and material resources, just to complete a secret treasure? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Ms. Adeline. You said that the book in his hand is called "Giant worms," ​​right?" Su Ge asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline nodded and asked, "What did you think of?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hope He has nothing to do with that one." Su Ge said that his face is not very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which one? Who is it?" Randall asked both eyes and eagerly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline is also curious and staring at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge coughed a secret saying: "The behavior last night was too inferior. It is time to show me as a god apostle, to teach the Pope's knowledge and momentum. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
