			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug raised his head and saw Bart leaning against the wall, his face pale and his body still trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouth is slightly raised, revealing a very light smile. "What's wrong, my friend, you don't look too good."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart’s line of sight did not dare to oppose Su Ge. Instinctively looked in the other direction and cautiously asked: "I will confirm first, are you still Su Ge Sotos? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug's mouth has a bigger smile, calmly stood up from the ground and spread his arms and said: "Of course, I am not Suger Sotos. Is it someone else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart listened carefully to these words, analyzing each of them and all the subtle tones and intonations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dozen seconds of silence, Bart turned his head and looked at Su Ge, and at this time just saw Su Ge looking at himself with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After carefully scrutinizing, Bart's heart slowly settled down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the observation and analysis, Bart determined that Sugg is still Su Ge, he is still a person, not something else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The hypnotist who attacked you is dead." Bart walked over and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded casually, his eyes falling on the head of Bart’s hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you have gotten important news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad's weird flame possesses Burning out the effects of any form of life, now burning the body but leaving the head alone, indicating that there are major problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successfully transferred the topic, Bart gradually relaxed and explained: "Well, I just used a special method to spy on his memory and got them to hold The complete plan of the ceremony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two deliberately did not mention the thing that had just been done, and it was very tacit to restore the strange and oppressive atmosphere to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing this Su Ge spirit, I immediately asked: "Quickly say!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart immediately said: "The whole process of planning is similar to what we suspected. Their ceremony was held on a farm on the north side of the city, where a circus called Cheyenne was stationed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" The grid suddenly shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Bart asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge brows and asks: "Are you sure that place? That place just sent a life case this morning, and Master Gerlos is now stationed there. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!? Homicide?" Bart heard this stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge continued: "The dead person is also a mysterious magician. We suspected that the Green Flame Brotherhood killed the magician."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible!" Bart immediately shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart's face is somewhat ugly: "I know from Nelson's memory." They have been deliberately keeping a low profile and they are not planning to launch any attacks until the ceremony is launched. Because their goal is to sacrifice the entire farmer and circus people as sacrifices, not to mention the motivation to act completely, Nelson There is absolutely no way to kill the image of the magician in his memory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugarton contemplatively, for a moment, he suddenly thought of the death of the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes were dug, the ears were dug, the heart was dug out, and finally it was lying on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene made Su Ge think of the death of the hypnotist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Su Ge’s head was inspiration: “Don’t he say that he was not killed by others, but committed suicide? Because he saw something that should not be seen. , caught in madness, just like a hypnotist? Is it forgiveness to pray for something on the ground?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts came here, and Su Ge added his thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked up and said to Bart: "Help me deal with this and see if there are other people in the museum? If something goes wrong, It is good to disguise yourself as a civilian to report through your relationship. I will now find Master Gerlos as soon as possible and report this matter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bar Features said: No problem, I will let my car send you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it's easy to be suspicious." Su Ge finished, ready to run out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart seems to have thought of something and hurriedly reminded: "Yes, there is an important piece of information you need to know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad indulged, instinctively recalling the tone of Su Ge’s just above, truthfully said: "According to Nielsen The memory, they seem to be invited by someone to come to the ceremony. The ultimate purpose of the ceremony is not to summon the original fire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is it?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not calling the original fire? This made Su Ge completely ignorant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad’s face was asked: “Have you heard of the Holy Grail?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Holy Grail? The omnipotent wishing machine?” Su Ge said instinctively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad dignified and shook his head and said: "The Holy Grail is the highest secret treasure left over from ancient times. They are rumors that they are a condensation of endless knowledge in one aspect. Each holy grail represents the limits and origins of a certain field."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg thought and asked: "What is the relationship between the original fire and the Holy Grail?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The seven sacred cups in the rumor have long been concealed in the long river of time, but there are plenty of clues and items in the world about these holy grail. These things are collectively called For the Holy Grail documents. Nielsen got the information that hides a holy grail document in the city. Their purpose is to bring out the holy grail documents here through the original fire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
