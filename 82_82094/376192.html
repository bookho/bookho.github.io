			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the past half an hour, Su Ge put all the things in his mind together and slowly opened the black eyes like black holes, pinching his hands, the tides Say: "I feel that I have mastered the life and death of all things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is just a sense of expansion that gains tremendous power, not Su Gezhen. Have the power of this horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only three hours, time is tight, you must speed up!" Su Ge immediately closed his eyes and launched his powerful spirit to sense Keep your cane in reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, Su Ge felt the brilliance in the darkness, and his heart suddenly relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This eight times the psionic power can barely sense this anchor point. Stigmata, potion, the lack of one of these two things I will be trapped here, I can't go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something fortunate in my heart, Su Ge immediately activated his psionic power in Gunniel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, a meteor-like lightning smashed the gray world and directly connected with the Su Ge here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge motivated his whole body of psionic power, and initiated the call form of the squad through Gongrand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the appearance of a ray of light, Su Ge is completely covered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, his body disappeared, completely out of the dreamland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a violent spin, Suge felt himself falling on the solid ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug! Su Ge!" Although the head was slightly blurred, but the ear still heard the shouting not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaking his head, Su Ge stood up with his hands and stood up, seeing the three people carefully approached by Randall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they looked at each other, everyone suddenly breathed a sigh of relief: "Fortunately, you are finally back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stood up and asked: "I use How long?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About 122 minutes." Mill said precisely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance looked aside with a black streamer tattoo on Su Ge’s chest: "You really got the power of your Lord!?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly, went to the side to put down his sleeves, put on his clothes and put on his hat and said: "I can’t count it, just borrow it temporarily, I can only maintain three. Hours, let me temporarily have the means to surrender the Son of God. Time is tight, let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people listened to their hearts and did not ask to leave this quickly. underground space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the castle, everyone is waiting anxiously, and Vegginia and others are now fighting hard with the ghosts without entities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have very limited means of attacking the spirits. At this moment, eight of them are suppressed by about a dozen ghosts, and they can only defend themselves and cannot form. Effective attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr.!" Seeing Suge coming out, Hillston said with relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to death!" Here, the ghost of the flaws was slammed, and four rushed toward Hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A heavy bell rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people clearly saw that a black glow spread rapidly around the center of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four ghosts that were hit by these halos, the body collapsed and screamed and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other ten inspirations that wrestled with other people were stunned by the black halo, and they trembled and said: "Don’t dare We are not afraid!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the gaze of the crowd, they seem to have seen the indescribable existence of terror, and they are afraid to carry it on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ignorant soul, you have no need to stay in the world. Obey the destiny, free yourself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Swept by this black halo, these souls disappeared as quickly as they melted in a trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that their souls are broken up, but that their bounded shell is broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...is the knowledge of death!?" Seeing this, everyone is wide-eyed and his face is incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge helped the hat to take the lead and said, "Let's go, let's solve this problem."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, everyone was incompetent and full of confidence for a time, because at this moment, Su Ge’s performance of the world’s bailout posture allowed them to see the hope and future of the bright future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really right!" All the nobility thought of the beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side, in the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palace was not destroyed at this time, and the overall preservation was complete. It’s just that there are a lot of wandering werewolves in the middle, which makes the former quiet palace become crowded and sultry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a completely separate huge courtyard on the northwest side of the Imperial City, which is dedicated to the ancestral temple of the Guinness family, the ancestral temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the high walls around the temple have been pushed down, leaving only six buildings standing alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding ground, the walls of the building are now painted with a large array of white lime, covering the entire courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the courtyard, there was originally a huge deep ancient well, but at the moment a five-meter-high huge three-level altar was built on the ancient well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The altar is made up of special jade, which is painted with mysterious runes and words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four Mithril avatars in the four corners of the first level of the altar, namely the dragon, the sheep's head, the bull's head, and the crow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four black embossed cans in the four corners of the second level, with a dark, oil-like liquid inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area at the third level is already very small, almost only a little larger than a double bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the candle with corpse oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the black complex array, Vanas was lying there in a black bed skirt, lying gently on his lower abdomen, double The eyes are closed, the beautiful face is matched with the strange black, giving a mysterious, demonistic visual impact, like the Snow White after the blackening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the altar, there has been a collection of indescribable, just like the essence of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These breaths of condensation condense into water droplets in the second level, and then enter the third level of Vanas lying through the lines under the jar. The altar turned into a dark gas, which was quickly absorbed by Vanas' body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can feel that Vanas’s body has stopped breathing, and even the skin is cold and cold, just like a dead person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the progress?" In the sky, floating this one and Su Ge met the same moon beast in the dreamland, bowed down and asked Ollie to the scar Buddha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver nodded hard: "About five hours ago, she was infected with a lot of death, she has turned into the purest death witch, and it has appeared on her chest." The sarcoma that symbolizes the witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the massive death scent enters her body through the sarcoma, combined with the curse in her blood, the embryo is already in three Formed a few hours ago, nowadays it has passed the fragile childhood and can now accept more nutrients."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Moon Beast ordered: "Start filling." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, Oliver, Dr. Salo, the Duke of the Mountain, took hundreds of people and simultaneously mobilized the psionic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The psionic power of hundreds of people played on the altar through the circle of law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, the four statues on the bottom of the altar were like alive, and they opened their mouths and made a strange noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second level of the four jars were boiled, and the thick smoke rose over the entire third level altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of Vanas lying there suddenly sinks, her whole body is soaked in the darkness of the dead, and the outside world The breath of death is poured from her nose, ears, and mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, Vanas’s entire body was dyed black, and his closed eyes slammed open, shimmering with scarlet eyes After two times, I reached out and touched my belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point she found that her lower abdomen was rapidly expanding at a rate visible to the naked eye, like a pregnant mother who was accelerating time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this situation, Vanas has a dull expression and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My body is still intact and kept clean. It means that this thing should be the fictional body of what is called the law of death. It is not true. Child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's fine, otherwise, this flawed body is not qualified to accompany the Pope, and is not qualified to serve my Lord." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a strange form, Vanas did not have any fear and anxiety at this time, because she had already received the promise of the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she is confident at the moment that the Pope will surely come to save himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This infusion is very fast, and the four cans are completely infused in just ten minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Vanas did not feel any discomfort, but was very comfortable, as if his spirit and body were baptized and sublimated at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
