Occasionally I heard the news of Ada, and Ada was once again chased by the Glorious Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley lay on his arm and said faintly: "How? Want to fly? Beautiful twins, the opposite property, especially Is it the same existence as one of your own sisters, just think about it and stimulate your animal nature?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard the words full of vinegar, sigh He said in a tone: "I have talked to you many times. I really don't have that kind of distorted thing about Ada. I really regard her as my sister. After all, she really helped me a lot."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I help you more than her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I can't leave you now! Su Ge said, and kissed her hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哼哼...Sheryl is still not satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at Shirley’s look, Su Ge curiously asked: “I heard Ada say that you have seen each other between the two. What is it like?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley looked at Su Ge and said faintly: "Look at it, both look tired."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about these?" Su Ge was a little disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t use mortal thinking to look at the two of us, the kind of sister’s sentiments don’t make any sense to us. She jumps out of causality and saints, I It is a unity with Him and becomes a god. At this height, the two of us have nothing to do with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard this sigh There are some pity in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we have some common goals," said Shearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s heart: "I?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl said plainly: "You are not stupid. When you first met, although you told me A lot of nonsense, but it is very interesting. I don't like those guys. If you really kill the group of gods, maybe you can get my greatest pleasure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger said with a wry smile: "This is a bit too far away. I know all the guys and you, especially the one of them, there is no way to kill."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley was silent and seemed to agree with Suge’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, two people fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, two people went out and found that the sky was completely clear, but the sense of crisis on the whole ship was more terrible than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he clearly felt that the whole boat was a little confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people suddenly heard a scream when they didn’t take two steps in the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sugg hurriedly ran with Xue Lier after screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing a young man wet down on the ground, it seems to be drowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the youth, two women were scared and pale, full of helplessness and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the youth’s body is still slightly pulled out, and it can be seen that it seems that it has not just died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is one of the three mysterious people who came into contact with Drake. It should be a professional mystery." Sug said, shaking left and right. After a while, I saw two monsters smashing in a plate, like a snake-like golden erect icy looking around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have a body similar to humans, and their bodies are covered with dense scales. They have thick and powerful limbs, claws and stout tails, behind the chest. There are huge moles, and the spine and arms have streamlined fins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are tall, two meters high and have a sly fish head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden head has two mouths on each side, each with a smashing tooth, which looks incredibly scary and scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Kraken!" Su Ge saw these two things and knew how this guy died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kraken is a native creature in the system of vision, which needs to be seen at 28 o'clock, and often attacks those who can see them in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attribute is weak, weak mercury, similar to the water ghost, but because of the scales on the body, it is highly resistant to physical attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of each Kraken is far beyond normal humans. If in the sea, five Krakens can kill a master mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, these guys like to be in groups, and every time they appear in tribal form, there will be at least twenty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the two Krakens seem to be waiting for what this mysterious person can see, and there is no attack on the two women. meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown is fearless, they are in the system of vision, they will not attack ordinary people who can not see them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment when Su Ge saw two Krakens, the two monsters instantly sensed something, turned their heads and saw Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕噜咕噜..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a strange sound in their mouth, open The sly mouth came towards Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do they attack the believers of the Cthulhu Order?" Seeing this, Shirley had some surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger said casually: "They are not deep dive, they are similar to demons and are the local monsters of this world. Naturally, they will not care about this Cthulhu." "Those believers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge raised his fist and said: "Even, they may still compete with the deep dive for the hegemony of the ocean." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley listened: "There is such a thing that attracts them. It should be the surviving bug."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, two The monsters have already rushed toward Su Ge at a very fast speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are far more human than humans, and the distance of more than ten meters actually came to Suge in less than two seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Su Ge’s fist slammed forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗡嗡嗡...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of intense shocks passed through Su Ge’s fist, Using air as a medium, it acts on the bodies of two Krakens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咕噜噜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two pirates suddenly couldn’t help but tremble, then The protruding fish eyes spurt out with turbid green blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at his fist with satisfaction: "The grasp of vibration is not only stronger, but more and more refined."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley asked faintly: "Have you forgotten your settings?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this Su Ge looked at it and then hurriedly used another night wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, Su Ge’s face was not very good, holding his forehead and sighing: “Fortunately, the bug did not monitor here, he is now Attention should be on the side of the Cthulhu Order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has just used the sophisticated night clock detection again to ensure that his own people are not collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, he did not find any monitoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look at your acting skills so well, I thought you were a professional actor, but now it seems to be the case." Shirley will not let go of a mockery Su Ge's chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
