			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At eight o'clock in the evening, three of the private rooms in a high-end hotel were opposite each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four men are guarding outside, the rest of the man and the woman are sitting on the sofa with a prudent attitude, their waists are straight and their hands are on their knees. Two freshmen who are about to be interviewed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite of Su Ge is a relaxed, comfortable leaning on the leather sofa, slowly with aroma of coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the potion has been neutralized by the restored potion, and the black lips and blood vessels have subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's put down the cup, Su Ge smiled slightly: "Don't be too cautious, you are not a cultist who is extinct and has no hostility to you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mocks listened to a little relaxation, but smiled and smiled and replied: "Thank you for the understanding of the bishop, we are all military-born, so used to sit here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and put down the cup: "Time is precious, let us go directly to the topic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Mox organized the language and said: "The bishop, this secret treasure, although the Marquis is not used, but it is related to the face and majesty of the entire Imperial Navy, so the Marquis will pay so much attention."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug raised his hand and looked at the metal red ball in his hand: "But it is in my hands now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, so we are willing to pay a sufficient price and hope to reach an agreement with you." Side by side, mature middle-aged women answered carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger smiled and asked: "So what is the price enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Other secret treasures? Or money? Or a rare mysterious material?" Mocks tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people suddenly looked awkward and didn’t know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge knows that these two people can't do the Lord and replied: "This is not an urgent matter. This thing will be safe in my hands. You two don't seem to be ready. Go back and prepare your own cards. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Su Ge got up and was ready to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moggs saw that he was in a hurry and said in a hurry: "Can you open a price tag? We know that we can go back and discuss it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge set his hand: "I don't think about what I want, wait until I think I will inform you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, push the door open and go out and leave the two people below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do?" Middle-aged woman asked Moggs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morges bit his teeth: "Let the telegraph of the emperor, report the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Can you testify to Su Ge through the church?" Middle-aged women thought of an idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moggs gave her a blank look: "Idiot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle-aged women suddenly lost Think of it, silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all the nobles of the entire emperor are eager to rely on the church, but this arrogant admiral will not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Ge returned to the church, Gerlos was back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really fast, the patrolman of the aftermath wants to find you to confirm that the situation has not been found." Gerlos has taken off his equipment, The taste of wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took off his hat and sat down: "It’s just killing some criminals. Is there any good confirmation? Is there not a lot of witnesses in the presence? Just ask them. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss looked at him and said: "What do the messengers say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything Didn't say, I need to determine the situation first. If you can, my later steps will be very calm." Su Ge looked at the metal ball in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jellos seems to have no interest in blood sacrifices, and continues to drink without speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At night, the Cavaliers will come to you," Su Ge said suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss heard a glimmer of light in his eyes and turned to look at Su Ge. There seemed to be a seriousness that could not be expressed: "I am very Look forward to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you still have a sense of expectation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, just dictation. "Jerousus's voice still has no fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "Ms. Adeline is expected to like your smile."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Gerlos heard this slowly clenching his fist: "I like it too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say goodbye to each other, Su Ge returns to the bedroom and will sacrifice blood Frozen into a puck and throw it to Lobo to let it play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the arms, the book of frenzy filled with blood, Su Ge did not directly watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing is in your own hands, you can't lose it, you can watch it at any time. He now has more important things to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closed to sleep, Suizhong has returned to the Kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the temple, Su Ge said to the knight: "Bring the Bonnie ribbon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The knight nodded immediately after listening and left quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in a few minutes, Bernice in his sleep was taken to the Kingdom of God by the Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See the Pope." Lifting the skirt, Bernice elegantly salutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly and asked: "How is the relationship between the Admiral and the church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Bennis immediately shook his head: "It's very bad, even the fire is not allowed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the reason?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis nodded hard: "I listened to Tsui West and said that she had a sister before, and she was left behind and disappeared. When she found it, she was already dead." At that time, the Marquis of Grasse was very sad, and then suddenly began to alienate the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel this thing is awkward, so I detailed the matter with the teacher. The investigation revealed a huge secret." When it came to this, Bernice's eyes lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Admiral has no faith. He was born in the Steam Guild. He was originally a shipbuilding doctor. Later, because of the sudden death of the old Marquis, he was forced to join the Navy. Yang became a mysterious person and began his own glory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because there is no faith, he is very disdainful about the church, and many times with the young There was a conflict in the church. Although they could not understand each other, they were still harmonious and there was no major conflict."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About ten years ago, because One thing, the Marquis of Grasse completely broke with the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict saw this Su Ge seriously: "His eldest daughter was found It is a witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is very calm: "Continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The process is now I don’t know, and the final result, his eldest daughter was killed cruelly by the church, and the dead body was taken away after death. Today’s graveyard is just a "There is a time when the parents are the most painful and powerless."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, because of that incident, his wife was grieved and died of illness a year later, leaving a pair of children, Tracy and her brother. The Marquis of Grasse also completely broke with the church because of the temperament of that matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But his power in the navy is too great, the church wants several times Move him, but it doesn't help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said: "There should be no other forces? How much is an admiral's power? Can't hold the pressure of the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bernice admired his face: "The Pope has a true insight. For many years, he has been supporting the emperor of today. According to the investigation of Adelin's teacher, the emperor is quite rebellious, and the church is already upset. It has been for many years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the glas character?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The character seems to be very restrained Lonely, although powerful, there are no friends. Listening to Adelin’s teacher, he has a good reputation in the mysterious world. He will use warships to transport some mysterious materials and materials across the mainland, which is why he is so rich now. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Businessmen? That's a lot of work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indulge in a moment, Su Ge said to Bernice: "Take me to say hello to Grasse, tell him that the blood sacrifice is now in my hands and show goodwill to him. Also tell him that the blood sacrifice can be given to him at any time, but he owes me a favor, A person who will be confronted with the church, can reveal a little about our deposit. . "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Bernice listening to fine shiny eyes, the heart suddenly lift itself up, because this is the first command of His Majesty the pope himself issued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes! Absolutely do not disgrace the mission!" said Bernice immediately, her voice was cheerful and excited, as if she had been appointed by the teacher to accept the work of the team leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the command, Su Ge asked: "Do you have anything to report?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;柏Niss shook her head: "Not yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sent Bernice back and called Adeline again. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Adeline’s just checking out the news from Bernice, Adeline added: “There are certain dragons and believers in Grasse’s mainland. Relationship, at the same time he once provided materials to the Wolf Legion, fought together, and also had a cooperative relationship with the House of the Master of the Master. It can be said that the mystery is very open."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard some accidents: "It seems that this big fish should be caught."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, there is one more thing, Our female warlock sisters will get news that there are questions about the witches that should be near the storm plateau. It is now known that there are cold-shoulder churches, glorious churches, healing churches, and the spies of the people who have not fallen to the fortress are beginning to extend towards you. Be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
