			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other, Su Ge did not relax his vigilance, the psionics did not send, and the cane was motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher stood on the door panel, his body was very thin and thin, but gave a feeling of meteorite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a piece of black stone that has experienced countless winds and rains, it is hard and firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;铮! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The friction of the metal suddenly sounded, and the sawtooth chopper in his hand folded and gave a hard voice: "You really are masters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing his heart, Su Ge has a little peace of mind. Because this means that at least the butcher is not controlled by those weird things, nor is it out of control because of what he sees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least for now, he is still a man, standing in the same camp as himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge slowly relaxed his cane and slowly breathed a sigh of relief: "Just your temperament is too scary."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher looked down at the door panel and said: "I just got a fist and can wear a boxing iron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Fist!?" Su Ge heard a jump in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound that just like a sledge hammer is actually caused by his fist! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How terrible is this guy's body!" Su Ge is full of vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher continued: "But there is nothing in this thing, don't you feel weird?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Su Ge converges in the heart of the shock, looking down at the door on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the dust dissipated, and Su Ge could see that there were more than a dozen shallow punches on the gray-black door panel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" Su Ge's eyes sparkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sound of the crash, he clearly knew how terrible the fist was. What makes him even more amazed is that the wooden door, which seems to be decaying, has withstood this power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher walked down the door and glanced at the second side of Su Ge, faintly asked: "Have you met other people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I met one, I was killed," said Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher silenced: "I have met a dozen, and I have been killed by me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Is it all possessed by that kind of skeletal ooze?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher shook his head: "They seem to see something, the whole body grows black hair, and goes crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you encounter a demon?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devil!?" The butcher at this time is more talkative than before and seems more willing to talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and said the situation he had just seen in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher responded: "It is indeed the means of the flame demon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people suddenly fell into the trap Silent, each thinking about their own affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you think is the relationship between this and the abyss?" After a few minutes, the butcher asked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug shook his head: "I don't know, but since there are demons, how much is related to the abyss."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher turned to the foggy sea not far away and said: "Now you should find the three archbishops as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This city It’s very weird, I just walked for an hour and got lost.” Su Ge talked about his situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher returned to the road when he said: "It’s very weird. Although we all fell from the sky, but the position is completely different, it seems to have experienced space disorder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"How come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I obviously fell from the sky, but when I got back to God, my body was in a closet Inside, the wardrobe seemed to be some kind of living thing, ready to eat me, and then I was dismembered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same is true of other people who have come all the way. Some people are in the trash, some are in the sewer, and even I see a person, half of the body stuck in the wall, very strange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge immediately thought of the two clerics who had just drained the water, and his heart was in utter disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t walk in, they weren’t dragged in by anything, but they fell straight into the sewer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this Su Ge’s heart was more cautious, turned around and looked around, and then the eyes suddenly fell on the jars that were crushed by the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These jars are pottery fired in clay. The interior is relatively rough, and the dusty outside is very smooth. There are also fine and delicate lines on it. When the original porcelain was fired, the author was very careful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge bent down and picked up a fairly complete porcelain bottle bottom. After a careful look, I found that this method of firing porcelain has never been seen, and The technique and the fire are very backward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These things should be a long time away from modern times," said Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher bent down and took a bottle and looked at it. He said directly: "This is the method of firing in the period of the gods. It is made of earthen kiln. The method."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Clay kiln firing? You know this very well?" Su Ge stood up. Butcher faintly said: "I like to carve porcelain, so I have some understanding of this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"These jars are at least 8,000 years old. Just take out one of the treasures that are worth the price. The top should draw the mainstream patterns and words at the time, you can know the social situation at that time. I don't know who is going to break it. It’s a pity.” The butcher took the shards and looked sorry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, I leaned against Su Ge and leaned my head to look outside the church, indicating that it had nothing to do with myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes twitched slightly, and the heart was filled with regret and sorrow: “What clues can you draw?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s broken, and it’s completely messed up. It’s at least a dozen hours, or even longer, and it’s a waste of time to restore it.” Butcher said that putting the pieces in his hands on his body is counted as a memorial. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge looked down at the second ha, and then he shrank his head and hid behind the black cloak, his face innocent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher said at this time: "If there is no clue on your side, then come back to me with me. I found a pass on the bridge. The passage to other places, but there are a group of hills on the top, I can't get through."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Qiuqiu!?" Su Ge immediately thought of falling, The monsters that are seen by the dwarf clowns,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Qiuqiu people are lower-level Yi people, and they need 28 sights to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average height of these guys is about one meter two, the whole body is red, and they live in groups, with similar wisdom to humans, but they are even more crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are extremely cruel, and they are loyal followers of the black blood, they are always eager for the blood, and when they encounter the enemy, they will tore the enemy. Kill all the blood before killing the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Qiuqiu people's physique is far beyond normal people, they have certain mysterious resistance, they are very powerful, they are very fast, they will use weapons, and they will be cruel. , equivalent to a professional-level fighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of Qiuqiu people are commanded by a Qiuqiu ritual. This ritual usually uses two to three spells, which is very difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people in the hills are around a hundred, and under normal circumstances they will not act alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge silently nodded and said: "Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two people followed the butcher The stairs that have just arrived are going down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tandem in the dark and damp corridor, the butcher said: "Since we have to fight together, we should be familiar with each other's knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Geen said: "I agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My knowledge is very simple, I only There will be a spell." The butcher said very generously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only one spell?" Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher continues: "I only have one basic spell: intensive surgery, this is the spell I have been using since I became a mystery."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you rely on the knowledge of this basic spell to go all the way to the master?" Su Ge was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher nodded: "Well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge returned and said: "I The knowledge is sound waves, you should know a little more. Through the vibration of the sound waves can form a shield, you can form a flying knife, you can also explore the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the introduction, the two had already followed the steps to a circular room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like a dungeon, rounded, about ten meters in diameter, surrounded by solid walls, with a chair on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a person sitting in the chair, this person is a hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His limbs were shackled and shackled in the chair, and the eyes did not know because there was nothing left, there were two blood holes left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood ran down the face to the chest, and there was no breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one around, according to the previous situation, it should have been put on a chair when he returned to God." Butcher said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger looked closely and found that it was full of dust and rust, and even the dust on the chain collar still existed, and the last time it was seen I should not know how many years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this hunter seems to suddenly appear here, the limbs just appear in the four squats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who was his eyes dug?" Su Ge had some doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher replied: "The hunter of the disaster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge did not continue to bar down, got up and saw the butcher climbed up the top of the ladder like the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge also followed up, and did not take two steps and suddenly thought of the underground two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two haha, the head is very chic, meaning you go up first, don't care about me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and shook his head and climbed up the ladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such a tragic and desperate place, Erha can always relax and soothe his trepidation and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When did the Tindaros hound have such a funny character." Su Ge couldn't help but think of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ladder is completely vertical and is about ten meters high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two people climbed up, Su Ge accidentally discovered that it was a small shack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house is made of wood and stone. The interior is very simple. There is no more than a bed, a desk and a chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no paving blocks on the ground, but uneven soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment a cold wind blew, and the shape of Erha appeared in the wind, stopping at the foot of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher saw some movement on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this creature, he has not seen it, and has never heard of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a room for the grave guard." The butcher said, go out along the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge just asked, he found himself asking There are a lot of words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this cottage is a very bleak cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cemetery is large, round and has a diameter of 50 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no regularity in the cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tombstones are cluttered together, and even in the middle are even a large number of coffins that have not been able to reach the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coffins are like abandoned building materials, and stacked with the tombstones, they are strange and give a kind of uncontrollable repression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tombstones around the cemetery are everywhere, weeds are overgrown, and the ground is wet and muddy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many long, crooked trees on the edge of the cemetery, and four gray stone sculptures stand at equal distances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stone sculpture is about five meters high and exquisite craftsmanship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only one stone sculpture that is human, and the remaining three are non-human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last side is a huge monster with a snake-like body and bivalves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a creature like a giant spider in front of it, with lots of legs and scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the left is a human like a robot with two giant pythons on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last person close to the two is a tall man in a robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the four statues are different in shape and lifelike, but there are no heads at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides no head, the rest of the statue is very neat and strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge looked at the four statues in confusion, thinking of the statue in the square before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statue has no head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does this mean? Why are all the statues without heads?" Su Ge asked. Butcher looked up at the statue and said calmly: "The world does not allow perfect things to exist, and people are not qualified to look directly at the gods, even God." The statue of 祗 is also not allowed.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart jumped: “You mean, these four statues are statues of gods?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher nodded and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has fallen into deep meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜呜呜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contemplation, the screaming screams ring again Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Suge listened more clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that two people are closer to the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher went out along the steps of the cemetery and said, "Let's go, our goal is the monster, but before that, we must deal with those Chuqiu people. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and followed him out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
