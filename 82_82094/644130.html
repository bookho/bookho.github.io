			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing on the edge of the crowd, Su Ge did not rush into the crowd and other people to mingle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of this group get together, and it’s all in one is to do things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now at the foot of the emperor, the church is still staring at itself, and Su Ge does not want to expose too much here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke is a young talent known as the emperor. He will be called away by other youths of similar ages and talk about the secret topics between these young people. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has a glass of wine, sitting on a bench next to him, watching the people who laugh and talk, and constantly releasing the night bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really not normal." After the night, Yu Bo released, and Su Ge did not feel any mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can such a big man sit here so coldly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some strangers, Some familiar voices suddenly came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned his head and turned his head, and his face was a bit brilliant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How? Don't you know me?" asked the young man with a gray hair and a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled and stood up and hugged him: "How can I not know? If it weren't for you, I guess I was already a group of cultists." It’s killing.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it’s not someone else, after the formal departure in Bain’s city, Bart has never met. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two years without seeing, Bart is still the same, but the chin has a tailored beard, the whole person's temperament is more calm and restrained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Su Ge think of a man in his memory who is elegant in his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bat smiled at Su Ge and sighed: "To tell the truth, I never dreamed that you have such a terrible background and connections."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know the things of the ancient city?" Su Ge was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart looked around and whispered: "Do you still remember Childe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge nodded: "Of course remember." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celde was the deputy bishop of the Nighthawk Church, the deputy of Sapir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is very inconspicuous, the weak sense of existence and the temperament of the wall is easy to ignore him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge just finished, and immediately became clear: "Your hands are really long enough."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad touched the chin of the chin: "The League of Legends is our base camp after all. Without a means, how can we stand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not afraid that I will go out?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will you?" Bar did not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old friends meet again, both are very happy, happy greetings After that, Su Ge whispered, "How come so many big people? Is there anything going to happen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know!? I thought You came because of this incident." Bart was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is speechless: "I actually want to track down a female ghoul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Two years have not seen, obviously become a party overlord, how are you still so ... ah ah ... so pure?" Bart can not think of a suitable adjective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"............" Pure Su Ge said nothing to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barthaha smiled and said: "You are still you, still so thorough and straightforward, it makes you feel at ease."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am so good like a good person?" Su Ge touched his face and said dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart went on to explain: "It is said that someone here holds a holy grail document."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then ?" Su Ge instinctively asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart’s eyes glimpse: “And? What more? Then the Holy Grail document is not attractive enough??”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge’s clothes angle lifted slightly, seeming to feel the confidence he was valued, but was directly pressed by Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! That's pretty appealing." Su Ge's tone of perfunctory answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad touched his chin and said: "It seems that you are really developed. Are the Grail documents not interested?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled: "Of course I am interested, but I don't have such a strong desire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conversation, Duke held a glass of wine Come over: "Mr. Bart knows Mr. Assassin!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad smiled and nodded: "I have known for a long time, old friends."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Duke’s heart was secretly surprised: “How much energy does this Mr. Black Mist have? Is this good friend a little too much?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart is a celebrity in the world of financial investment, and his family has a large number of shares in large companies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if their Haussmann family is in the clearing company of the Allied Empire, Bart holds a small stake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s understanding of two people is not unexpected. After all, two people are business people. After they are big enough, even if they don’t know, they should all hear about it. Pass the other person's name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now use the warmest applause to welcome our heroes!" At this moment, a cheer came from afar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge turned his head and saw that Drake was standing in the center of the crowd at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside him, there is a beautiful lady wearing a purple dress, a chestnut-colored hair on her head, a bodybuilder, and a charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She is Mrs. Merris," Duke said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge eyes staring at this beautiful lady, hoping to see some clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? Now like a mature woman?" Bart asked in a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge whispered: "This is a far cry from my family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Are you married?" Bart asked unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge casually said: " Engagement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really fast."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front, mature and beautiful Mrs. Merris said in a loud voice: "All of the glorious deeds of Mr. Drake’s heroes should be familiar, take the initiative to sacrifice, protect the weak, and finally lead others. The people fought back and not only repelled the cult, but also saved thousands of passengers on the Saroni."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is our true hero." Meri Mrs.’s voice was very inflammatory, and the people around him were enthusiastic and cheered loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a good time for Drake standing in the middle. He never thought that he had such a day, walked into the circle of nobles, got this. Admiration and welcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially those Miss Aristocrats look at their own adoration, he is already floating, and the heart has begun to calculate today to spend the night with that beautiful noble lady. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge noticed his illusion and his inner filthy thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the midst of it, Su Ge could feel a gaze looking at himself through Drake’s body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
