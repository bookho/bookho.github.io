			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Ada saw Su Ge's look, and his appearance was somewhat unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge took the pendant and looked at it carefully. "Can this show me? This thing seems to be the liar before me." The group has a certain relationship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has compiled a reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ida looked at Su Ge with a glance, and there was a trace of doubt in his eyes, but he refused, and said with a smile: "Take it quickly!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took the pendant and smiled at Ada: "I love you, Ada."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada smiled and said: "I love you too, kind little guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a pendant back to the bedroom, Su The grid immediately sat down and placed the pendant on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pendant is linked by a small metal chain with five pendants on top, namely the reverse cross, the pentagram, the sheep's head, the dragon, Minaret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The style is normal, the workmanship and materials are very mediocre, it is an ordinary pendant, it looks like there is no problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Su Ge knows that this thing is not ordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reverse cross, the five-pointed star, the sheep's head have always been the symbol of evil mystery, although in recent years with the relaxation of the policy, these signs can be civilians It's used as an ornament, but if you match this to the dragon and the minaret, it's a little different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, Su Ge also learned a lot in the death sect. Something is here, and these things are included. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In mystery, the dragon symbolizes power, and the minaret symbolizes theocracy. These two are most often found in certain runes and summons, as absolute The core of putting these five together will seduce some mysterious powers in the dark, causing some special reactions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And this special reaction is very concealed, he is not reflected in the materials and styles, but on the sound!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just heard these pendants at Su Ge When you hit the sound, you don't hear the crisp sound, but it is extremely unpleasant, like the harsh and horrible sound of stone grinding and bone friction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of voice, even the masters of Gerlos can't hear it, only those who know the sound-related knowledge, and those who have enough vision can hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These voices will subtly stimulate the soul and psionic power of the human being, causing arrogance when the subjectively unable to pay attention, and after the accumulation is sufficient, it will make people Going crazy, even the spirit will have some variation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's enough concealment and viciousness!" Su Ge carefully removed the pendant to prevent them from each other. Colliding again, making a bad voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all the accessories were wrapped in paper, Su Ge was lost in thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The circus, the magician of the climax... newcomer. Combined with the information of Bart before, it is very likely that this magician is in the Green Flame Brotherhood. Occupational magician. But this seems to be a bit wrong. The cultists can't hide, how can they be so bright and bright?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咦? No, maybe this group of guys will do the opposite?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge stood up from the chair: "First ask Ada The situation of the magician!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the bedroom, just to see Ada sitting on the sofa and touching the stomach of Erha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Erha was very comfortable to touch, lying there, and his face was comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge went over and asked seriously: "Ada, when the magician gave this pendant to you, did you say anything? For example Hang this pendant in a place with a lot of people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada licked his beautiful big eyes, then some confused said: " No, he didn't say much at the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Ada seems to think of something, and suddenly said: "Oh! Right. When he first opened, he seemed to want to say something, but later did not know why it was silent for a reason, then he said it was a souvenir and went home. Just put it up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;? ? ? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this black-faced question mark from Sugton, it’s no effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada’s face asked: “How do you reveal such a funny expression?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Ah! Nothing, it was infected by Luobo." Su Ge grinned and hurriedly waved his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luobo lying on the ground, he raised his head slightly, opened his eyes and looked at Su Ge in a way that looked down obliquely, revealing a "you Let me back the pot." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, did he still give others such a pendant?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada shook his head: "No, just this one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Su Ge did not ask too much about this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supper did not eat dinner, saying that he had already eaten outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After returning to the room and reading a book, Su Ge took the time to start a simple body training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ribs of the ribs, accompanied by the crisp bone friction, the fragile body of Suger was gradually stretched out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of stretching, Su Ge also carried out simple muscle training, at least to let himself be beyond the normal person's body, normal function Show it, you can't waste that drop of lion blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While active, Su Ge analyzes today's events while thinking about countermeasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From Ada’s conversation, I know that the magician really wanted to give this pendant to Ada and spread it to others. But when I was ready to speak, I suddenly changed my mind, but I still sent things over. What made him change his mind?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
