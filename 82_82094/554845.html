			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus followed the path he had discovered to the other side of the coalition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the dark wall in front of him, Gerlos slowly reached out and found that the eggs of the black goats that were harder than others were actually I have no obstacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what reason, he can generally know some. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he walked in with great confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This layer of black walls is very thick. He walked about five meters and found himself in the inner city of Yagu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their not far away, there is a huge mountain with a strange shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the mountain, the flash of the incomprehensible glory of the huge illusion seems to be calling him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is derived from the depths of the blood, the most primitive and impulsive and instinct of genes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect that this blood can still be used for a day." Gerlos said, his body was like a cold wind, and he quickly moved along the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the channel inside the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three men of Su Ge have now stepped out from the bottom of the underground palace and marched in the direction of the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This up and down and is completely two concepts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small plastic physique of Su Ge walked for about half an hour and was so tired that he could not walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angluhaha smiled, and very simply put Sug up and followed Randall all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The giant is the lord, with the strength of the three of us now, it’s OK to resist the escape, but to fight, I want to kill him. Maybe." Andrew said as he advanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge smiled calmly: "The problem is not big, our helper has come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, three people felt suddenly in front of the intersection Blowing in a cold cold wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Andrew was preparing for the alert, he found a man wearing a suit similar to Su Ge with a cold wind and they slammed into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is..." Although the dress is similar to Su Ge, Andrew did not relax his vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger said: "This is the war apostle who taught one of the four apocalyptic apostles in the evening bell."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus’s unique hoarse voice came out: “You call me a war.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Andrew carefully looked at this war The face exclaimed: "You are really talented in the evening church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge will certainly not say that his family is here, turning his head Asked Geros: "Can you feel the position of the Holy Grail?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss nodded and glanced at the huge skull behind Suge and turned to: " Come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then four people moved quickly under the leadership of Gerlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew looked at the steady, confident Jeroz in front of him and asked, "How do I feel a familiar atmosphere on his body." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge pointed to the skull behind him, and Andrew suddenly opened his eyes: "Is it!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sug nodded: "Yes, this is the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus has never said anything about his bloodline to Su Ge, and Su Ge has not asked . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Shirley hijacked Jerous, Su Ge felt some problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And before on the city wall, when Shirley said the three prerequisites of the Holy Grail, Su Ge basically confirmed that Gerlos has always been Hesitation, and the core reason for being hijacked by Shirley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the attraction of that blood, it was easy to get three people around, and spent a few hours of labyrinth. It took only fifteen minutes and four people came to their destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they walked in from a door and saw this huge twelve-sided space, they knew they had found the core of the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you look at it and see the most radiant thing in the middle, Su Ge’s brain is instantly filled with this magical and wonderful thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The speed of your coming is faster than I thought." The giant emperor sitting there did not move. The one who spoke to them was the left of the giant. face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg listened back to God, came down from Andrew and said as he advanced: "Oh? Do you know why you didn't get this holy grail?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant's face looked at Su Ge carefully, then saw the huge skull behind Su Ge, and finally locked his eyes on Gerlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An indescribable sense of oppression came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sense of oppression is not oppression, but from the instinct, the deep pressure of the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a civilian seeing an emperor, instinctively, he will bow down and bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, the giant emperor could not calm down, he slowly stood up, slowly turned his body and looked at Jellos with his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus slowly took off his mask and revealed a pair of golden eyes. He said hoarsely: "What do you want to say?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Giant Emperor slowly squeezed his fists with complexities and anger on his face: "Why! Why! Why are you here now!?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus calmly replied: "Things have passed. I thought the original landslide was true. Unfortunately, I was too naive. You and I are all survivors of the past. Belongs to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant emperor looked angry and asked: "You are a direct ancestor of the ancestors, so you are willing to be a dog for others!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss is very calm:" For the past 100 years, I have spent most of my time as a dog, but not now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Gerlos waved, The hoarfrost sword appeared in his hands and moved forward: "Abandoning resistance and becoming a deputy, you have tarnished the blood flowing in your body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "This blood itself is full of cursing and heavy smell!" The Giant Emperor was full of anger at this time, and roared loudly at Gerlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roaring sound echoes in the vast space, and it can't stop for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerez’s still-changing answer: “This is not a curse, but a gift. The taste is not stinking, but shelter. Your eagerness to make a quick profit. And narrow thinking makes your heart twisted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am twisted, but also for the revival of the great Byron! And you! Your prince again What have you done?? Help others to deal with their fellow citizens!?" Giants roared in anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus has come to a distance of less than five meters from him: "This is not a deal, but a salvation. The ancestors want to control the Holy Grail through the blood." In order to prevent it from appearing again, so as to avoid more catastrophe between people. For many years, our blood is like a jailer guarding the Holy Grail, preventing the Holy Grail from escaping from prison, while sheltering our ethnic groups through the Holy Grail, let us escape once. "Take it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, the opportunity to let our bloody liberation come. Today, the Holy Grail will come to the world again, under the control of my master's agent. We will free ourselves from these hundreds of thousands of years of responsibility and welcome our own lives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From now on, the whispers of the ancient gods will be thoroughly Stay away from my family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Gerlos had a comfortable and happy face: "Do you have anything else to say?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant heard this and heard his own prince say the truth for many years. He opened his mouth several times, but speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence for a long time, the giant whispered: "If this is the case, then these human beings should give us enough compensation to give us the Holy Grail and the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Whether it is a good person or a bad person, doing things is a matter of righteousness, or peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This self-convincing is very important to the mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious people who struggled on the edge of madness must have a firm and stable heart, so they must make their inner self firm enough without any hesitation and disturbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant is now, he is convincing himself for this reason, everything he does is right! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Gerlos already knew that this guy was crazy, his desire for the Holy Grail of the Soul and his desire for power had swallowed his last sensibility. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold wind blew, Geros’s eyes burned From the ghosts and ghosts, I said coldly: "In this case, you can only let you die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abandon! I really thought you were suppressing me on the blood. You can beat me!? You are just a master!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant screamed, and the majesty of the heavy horror emperor came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger could even see the air flowing around and began to flow quickly, surrendering to the lord-level emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this situation, everyone can stay without any hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shark potion that Su Ge directly took, the psionic spirit that had been consumed before was instantly filled up and tripled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss drank four potions in succession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Includes senior lions, senior sharks, senior irons, and intermediate cheetahs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This series of potent potions under the belly, suddenly Jelos's entire face was filled with black blood vessels, and soon became a black man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be able to see it, the muscles of Jerous’s whole body are constantly squirming, and the blood vessels on the forehead are gradually bulging, like a devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the overall momentum of Gerlos has been forced to lead the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugello looked at Jellos with envy, and he also wanted to use so many potions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a shark potion, or an inferior entry level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Andrew tightened the sword and shouted, a burst of white light appeared, and the milky wolf soul appeared again beside him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall took out his own storm glove and turned the whole body into a black and foggy state of half-real and half-virtuality, floating in midair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant saw the change of the four people at this time, and his face suddenly sank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially the improvement of Gerlos and Su Ge, he even felt that these two people could threaten their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss is very hoarse at this time, like the voice of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last time, 乖乖 surrender."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dream!" The giant snorted and lifted Take a foot and step on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, countless brilliance emerged from the ground, forming a powerful humanoid warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he not only controls the air, but even controls the psionic power that is spread in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, dozens of such air warriors appeared, holding the giant emperor in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four men fought side by side, and Su Ge took a deep breath: "Up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
