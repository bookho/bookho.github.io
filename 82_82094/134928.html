			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up, Aideline looked at Su Ge, and couldn’t re-examine this very simple little guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge’s brow furrows, counting how to bring these people together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adeline suddenly asked: "If I can help you bring these people together and pull them into your dreams, can you help me with some things in the future?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened for a moment, and his heart was filled with happiness, but he still calmly thought about it and said: "The things you can do are definitely help." But beyond the strength, after all, your own life is the most important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline smiled and said: "Of course, I don't have the hobby of letting people die." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no problem." Su Ge measured the pros and cons of this, and said refreshingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aideline nodded slightly and did not have too much discussion about the one that Su Ge had just mentioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First confirm, how do you summon it when you arrive? Do you want to summon your Lord directly into my dreams? I am afraid it will not work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of characters that pass through will leave a tragic remnant that cannot be described, even in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aideline is a master-level nightmare warlock, but she knows that she can’t carry that horror in terms of her current intellectual and spiritual vision. presence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you let that one appear in your own dreams, then waiting for yourself is not the joy of glimpsing new knowledge, but the abyss of broken souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge shook his head: "Of course you can't take this risk, your task is very simple. After pulling them all into the dream, I will let me The Lord descended in my dreams, and then “invited” them into my dreams through the messengers of my Lord.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When saying “invitation”, Su The mouth of the mouth has a faint smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this smile, Adeline’s heart was tight, because this smile was not revealed by normal people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, there is nothing to continue to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will consider first, if you can, I will give you the answer tonight." Aideline did not rush to promise, said directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge knows that this kind of thing is not going to come, he nodded slightly and said, "Okay, I am waiting for your good news!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Su Ge will still wake up the two witches in fantasy, put on shoes and leave here under the stewardship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing in front of the window, just through the glass Adeline just saw a few people from Su Ge going out along the path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The one should not be an ancient god, but it has the power and power of a god. The master of dreams... the master of death and storm... Even if the gods are multi-faceted, the difference between the two sides is too big.” Aideline frowned and fell into deep thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether it’s a true god or a false god is still unclear. But what is certain is that if I have the opportunity to reach out to him, just rely on breath and Sound can get a lot of dream-related knowledge. This should be a great help to my current bottleneck. Because the existence itself is an aggregate of knowledge, and the message is full of messages."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The benefit of oneself is on the one hand, on the other hand, I can determine exactly what his power is. Over the illusion of dreams, he can transform the witch to hide his identity, then his Power should not be limited to this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is the case, can you help Geros recover his feelings?" Aideline thought of the palm of her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Adeline, Su Ge’s heart was suddenly stable : "From what she just said, I should not refuse me. If it is really as expected, this matter is very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp On one side, Bernice suddenly asked: "Apostle... Su Ge, why did you just want to let other people enter the dream through the female warlock?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Su Geyi said: "Is there any other way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British with a weird look on his face: "In my mind, My lord has the initiative to convey the dream consciousness of others to himself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sighed and said: "It is ok, but only if I need it. There are related coordinates of that person, or there is a connection between them, knowing the nature and smell of that person's psionic energy. But now I don't know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course, these words will not be said by Su Ge, after all, this is detrimental to the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the face of these ants, I have to personally take the shot, which is simply defiled by my Lord!" Su Ge said in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Bernice was shocked and pale, almost squatting on the floor and saying, "Sorry! Sorry! It’s really disrespectful!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge puts his hand and says, "Nothing, this little thing, my Lord will not blame you. But this thing gives us a wake up, that is us. The people and servants who are the main people should think about themselves when doing things. Don't always rely on the infinite power of my Lord, but think more about whether this matter can be solved through their own abilities and relationships. Not only will it not bother me, but I will also spread the power of my Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills and Bernice suddenly looked at each other. The eyes are full of admiration and look at Su Ge, and the inner secret: "It is an apostle, the whole mode of thinking and thoughts are completely different from us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After accepting the teachings of Su Ge, Hills asked: "You just said that we belong to the church of the late bell, is not "Our church has been established?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough!" Su Ge coughed and whispered: "Because it is a special case, the church is now three of us. Personal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills nodded. After all, she just heard the apostle adults say that this church is dedicated to the poor people who are persecuted like themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is the Pope?" asked Bernice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
