			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not everyone is walking into the city, Horace leads about twenty people to stay at the door as a gateway to the gatekeeper, after all, if this fan The door suddenly closed, but it was a very desperate thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the preparations for the troops were completed, the large units did not go directly, but sent some scouts to conduct in-depth exploration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large force conducted a simple search in the building near the gate of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding buildings are empty and there are many living facilities. Judging by dust, there is no one living for about a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood at the gate of the city and looked around. The lingering waves of the late bell spread around and explored the surroundings and even the underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a weird underground." There was no problem in finding out around, but the aftermath of the late bell could not be passed on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Sapir came over and said coldly: "Is the Sotos Bishop not planning to do something? Many people around the world still want to see you." The means of the legendary bishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger listened around and found that many people were looking at themselves, curious, disdainful, gloomy. Suddenly...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "The believer who is the goddess should take the glory of the goddess as the mission. Since the bishop of Horace guards the gate, Bishop Sapir is leading the church, so I naturally can't stand like this. I will be the pioneer of the goddess to explore the situation in this city!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Su Ge’s cloak of arrogance turned and walked alone in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, many of the clergy around me were a little moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How dangerous the city is, they are not clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is full of unknowns, and often unknown is the most fearful existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this rumor, the waste of the relationship is so free and easy to walk into the unknown city, which has caused many people to make new changes to his evaluation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking forward to Su Ge, Moore made a look, Serena suddenly nodded and said: "Bishop Sotos, mind that I am with you. Exploring?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at her and nodded slightly, and the two disappeared into the street under the gaze of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the departure of Su Ge, Moore’s stalwart squad and the elf sect are together, and the formation is very tightly located not far from the gate. The place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those scattered mysteries have begun to walk in from the gate, and then they are very bold, or they are very desperate to go to the city, seems to want Looking for something treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything seems normal and calm, yet they have not noticed that something invisible on the ground is quietly approaching them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking on the retro streets of the city, Su Ge did not enter the interest in the surrounding buildings, because he already knew that there was nothing inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina quietly followed him, full of vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did you come over?" Su Ge asked as he looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina pinches her hand with a special pistol and says, "I have had the experience of fighting a hunter, and the captain is more worried about your safety."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!? Can't see it, Moore is still a very good man." Sug smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina snorted: "Cumati, can you not say so disgusting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge said with a smile: "Sure enough, there are always some messy things in my heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When talking, there was a sudden scream in front. Screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s body rushed out instantly. After running for 30 meters, he turned left at a T-junction, just to see that the thief who had just cured the church had a scary black gas, his eyes were red and a lot of hair. Growing rapidly from his body, several breaths became a savage savage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the clergyman suddenly turned back, a pair of blood red eyes saw their moment, the body suddenly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful, the core spell of the thief, refraction." Serena immediately reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge faintly said: "I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflection is the core skill of thieves, In fact, it is through the control of the light of its own psionic energy to create a visual illusion, so that the user enters the stealth state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a relatively advanced technique that requires professional thieves to be skilled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aftermath of the night clock found his position in an instant, and then Su Ge lifted his cane and pulled it directly to his left front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, the cane was easily blocked by an arm with a hand in a blurred light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the next second, just as the thief was preparing for action, the body began to tremble violently like an electric shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, the body fell weakly on the ground and could not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method of Su Ge today is not the same as yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the analysis and summary of the divine body, Su Ge’s mastery of this vibration resonance has come to the culmination of this knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The psionic energy he just consumed is only one-twentieth of the same blow of yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the one hand, the control is more elaborate, on the other hand, the amplitude of resonance has also been significantly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, you can see that the thieves are not flying like the eyes of yesterday, the internal organs are broken, and the bones are broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only the violent vibration that caused him to suffer paralysis and temporarily lost his ability to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked down at the crazy thief, and then the night of the soul of the soul passed on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as before, the night of the town has no effect on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Retreat!" Su Ge suddenly screamed, pulling Serena and then retreating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the thief was actually struggling with a whole body twist, and then a lot of black smoke suddenly burst around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a smoke bomb? Not quite like it." Serena frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly said: "He is not a variation of self, he is possessed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Attachment? Is that kind of possession of the spirit of the spirit?" Serena is not very familiar with the word possession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because possession is a relatively advanced vocabulary and skill throughout the mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the lord level, regardless of any occupation, even including all known secretarial professions, it is impossible to possess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "Some similar, but there is still a part of the parasitic effect. Something has entered his body, polluting his spirit." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know?" Serena had some surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t understand why Su Ge’s only a glance at it was that the thief was possessed, not self-mad, or some other reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly replied: "Only two people can't understand the night clock of this town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Which two?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One is a dead person, and the other is "not a person.""<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge just finished, an eccentric black shadow instantly rushed to Su Ge, like a flying worm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge snorted and his cane slammed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instant, an indescribable thick, low, like a flood of sound waves from the body of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time is very different from before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Suger, you can clearly see countless ripples like water waves, with Su Ge as the center of the stream, with a kind of Like a beastly terrorist power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow disappeared instantly, and the next second suddenly appeared behind Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what it didn’t expect was that the Suge’s bell was three hundred and sixty degrees without a dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arriving at Su Ge, I thought that the shadow of this attack was instantly hit by a powerful sound wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the arrival of the sound wave caused a fine ripple in his own shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cane in Su Ge’s hand was turned into a long gun, thrown out in an instant, and pinned precisely to the shadowed body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;叮! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clear sound, the rifle descended from the sky, and the shadow was firmly nailed to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge walked over at this moment and looked down at the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a black material of the size of a human head. It is very difficult to distinguish between it and the shadow of a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the thing is struggling desperately, trying to escape from the gunpoint of the Great God's Declaration, but it has no effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selena ran two steps and came over. She looked down curiously and asked, "What is this!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge touched his chin and said, "It should be Parasites of certain energy substances can attach to other people and affect the will of the host. They have no substantial combat power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this This shadow seems to have been stimulated and provocative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second was a slap in the face of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only seeing this shadow suddenly and rapidly rose, almost instantly became a dark quirky monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks like a huge black slime, but it’s more embarrassing than slime, not only with a lot of tentacles like spine bones, but also A lot of weird eyes, if seen in intensive phobia, will be instantly uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's relax." Su Ge said faintly, only to see that the monster just got bigger and ready to attack, its body began to become stiff, and then The speed visible to the naked eye quickly freezes and turns into a quirky ice sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serena saw this big eyes, and the incredible voice asked: "How did you do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the voice just fell, she instinctively fell on the long gun on the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This gun can not only become a variety of forms, but even have such a terrible chill!!" Serena's heart thumped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the last time, when the pistol was free to deform and returned automatically, they gave this weapon a rating of five top secrets, which is now all Know the most practical of the five-level secret treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this time, Selena found that they still underestimated the level of the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has the inhuman ability to instantly freeze such a weird monster into an ice sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This speed, this level has even reached the level of the six-level secret treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
