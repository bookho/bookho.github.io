			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, Jerous’s golden erect seems to have seen something, without any hesitation, picking up the potion and drinking two bottles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, his entire face turned black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put out the silver-white giant sword behind you. Such a huge sword is like a tree branch and he is waved twice and said: "Sure enough, it still appears."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Anthony stared at the sky, pinching his hand The guns said: "This is a giant grievance!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The top battle of the sequence three, giant grievances." Gerlos said, his left hand was A few weird symbols were drawn in the air, and then there was a flash of electric spark between his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then knock on the sword, the giant sword has been covered by lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the basic skills of the Demon Hunter: Thunderbolt mastery. After the bioelectricity in the body is strengthened by the potion, a substantial lightning is formed according to the mysterious law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The giant grievances belong to the imaginary physique, the weak thunder, the upper thunder." Gerlos said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five fighting priests heard this and pulled out a piece of paper with a strange text, like a Taoist spell, directly from his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they squeeze the paper, inject psionic power, and rub hard on their weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噼里啪! The glaring thunderbolt covered their weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘎嘣! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While others were watching the sky with nothing to do, and the whole body was taut and ready to fight, Su Ge’s face was so aggressive that he did not see anything. Only the ear heard the sound of the splint depression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down, it was just as if there were two sunken footprints on the deck full of blood, as if by a huge monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Su Ge could not see anything, even if it was a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The monster of sequence three, at least 30 points to see, can not see. I can't see the strange." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Block the scope of action with blood and silver bullets, don't let it devour other souls to strengthen yourself." Gerlos said, the body rushed quickly Go up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are seven exorcist nuns, six of whom took out their own guns and fired at the sky, and the remaining nuns of the pair also The weapon was attached with lightning and began to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Su Ge’s gaze, he saw a lot of blue smoke that was constantly corroding in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while Jerouss went down here, the horrible thunder and lightning were transmitted on the invisible body, and Sug saw a huge arm at least three meters long under the lightning. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Day, how big is this guy?" Sug's eyes widened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss is fighting very seriously at this time, while cutting, while dexterous dodging, while constantly pulling out from the waist what bombs, darts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the monster seemed to be very powerful. Suddenly, Gerlos’s body was suddenly blown out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big..." Su Ge was just preparing to scream, but he heard a broken glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss flying out did not seem to be hurt, but the layer of invisible shield around him was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This should be a psionic shield?" Su Ge knows this skill, and the priest will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus’s hand once again, the new psionic shield appeared, while rushing to the side and said to Su Ge: “Don’t lie, continue to do yours. Work, as long as I am still alive, it won't touch you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Sugerton returned to God and felt that the psionics had recovered. After that, continue to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Gerlos's attack was even more fierce, and the giant sword in his hand flew up and down, constantly attacking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!" The double-edged nun yelled at Father Anthony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she saw this monster suddenly turned, the huge claws were caught by Father Anthony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Father Anthony saw it, his body suddenly slammed back three meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tail!" Another nun yells! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Anthony turned his head and suddenly found out that this grievance actually had a tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tail goes down, and Father Anthony is also seriously injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the crucial moment, the hand of Gerlos's palm quickly drew a group in the air, and then a burst of white light appeared on his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the palm suddenly pushed forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗡嗡嗡...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a burst of sound like a vibrating air, strong air The gun directly pushed the tail of the wraith away and saved Anthony's life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hugh! Thank you!" Father Anthony said quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss made that hoarse, faintly said: "Continue to attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Father listens The hands crossed a sign like a triangle on the chest, and a whispered verse was sent in a low voice, and then a slight mist appeared on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, his physical strength suddenly rose to a grade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Use belief to increase!" Anthony said and rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other priests finished their nod and immediately used the same skills and rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There can be seen, the squeaking on the deck, the masts are constantly broken, the lightning and thunder, the battlefield of the bullets, the little gods are serious and will A poor soul is super-existent, completely ignoring the fiery battlefield behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This giant grievance is really very powerful. Under the leadership of Jellos, it took nearly forty minutes for the thirteen people to be under siege. The two priests were seriously wounded, and finally they won this monster that did not know what it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after the fall of the monster, everyone did not have much happiness, because all of them had a good eye and went up two points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not something to be happy about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the root cause of all people who are afraid of mystery. When you defeat the enemy here, you will not get rich loot and self-challenge like other worlds. The sense of accomplishment is only the helplessness and despair that gradually approach the abyss and cannot resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After solving the grievances, the people gasped with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss also has some breathing, but his attitude is still calm and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge squatted on the floor with his stomach at the same time, his face was pale, and his forehead continued to stick out the sweat of the beans. The side effects of the potion are very strong, and after the nausea, the abdomen is as painful as a knife. At the same time, Su Ge felt that his mouth had lost consciousness, and the throat and esophagus were full of intense heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Drink the second drop of potion," said Gerlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened to the pain and drank the second drop of the potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the pain was relieved a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much is left?" Gerlos asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugna took a look at Chahan water and said: "There are a total of 36 souls at the beginning, and now it has exceeded 23. It’s just because of the giant appearance, suddenly Seven souls have disappeared, and now there are six."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
