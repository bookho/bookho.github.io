			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the gods?" Duke, Steven, Iyeta and other six people stunned, eyes and expressions full of horror and... admiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm that just destroyed the earth has fallen from the sky, and all the cults who are ready to kill themselves are crushed, like the indifference of a wheel crushing a worm. And the destruction of efficiency, let them redefine what is killing in their own worldview, what is destruction, what is crushing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemies who just made them feel fear are now dying out under the prestige of the Great Lord, and several people look up with incomparable lofty piety and respect. It’s all in the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time they have no distractions in their hearts, no hesitation, they are extremely fanatical and want to admire under this horrible god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm and the thunder gradually dissipated. Surprisingly, the people opposite did not die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty people died almost half, and all of them were surviving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time these female warlocks were kneeling on the ground, their whole body trembled violently, their faces were pale, and their hearts were on the verge of being overwhelmed by fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment, they experienced the most horrible and desperate situation since they were young. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the storm descended from the sky, they felt that the entire sky had collapsed and turned to themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, their brains were blank, not even knowing to dodge, resist, fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s so dull to watch the “sky” fall down. Afterwards, they witnessed the instant evaporation of the fierce and horrible cultists beside them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, not cutting, not crushing, nor any other means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But evaporate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the indescribable storm has shattered all their organizations, even the spirit and mind, into the world in the moment they act on these people. The smallest particles on the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, they felt that it was not killing, but that a sacred and great existence was purifying the pollution of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have never seen such a murder, and they did not even think that they could completely evaporate so many people in such a way that they approached the sacred and magnificent way. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief instructor of their female warlock's combat power is the master's secret law profession, shadow mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is an invincible presence in the eyes of a female warlock, no matter what mysterious person can face it, it can be easily killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, such an invincible existence, still can not withstand the horrible storm, even 0.1 seconds did not insist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grande standing beside her witnessed the destruction of this powerful being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before blinking, that person is still standing there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the blink of an eye opens again, the person has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very clear that the black-spotted warlock did not escape, but was evaporated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That does not require any evidence and deduction, because her inspiration tells her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Grande closed her eyes desperately, thinking: "If you can die without pain, it might be a good choice."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Gran has a similar idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds of closing their eyes, they did not wait for their own destruction, but instead felt a very powerful presence from the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who exists as the master of the world, omnipotent and omnipotent, looks at everything in the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His power is boundless, His power is omnipotent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This storm is just a corner of his face. Even the breath that comes to this place is nothing but one of his inadvertent thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The momentum is really terrifying and too powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment of feeling, all the female warlocks did not hesitate, the whole body trembled on the ground, and the heart was full of jealousy and caution, for fear of causing the great existence. Yue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t know why the great existence killed those people and left themselves, they didn’t dare to think about it, fearing that their ignorant speculation would cause more horror. Disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warlock on the ground keeps one and uses all his thoughts and will to express his respect and respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if they don’t know if there are others other than themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass, not far from them, is full of red light and excitement. He is also the first time to witness the corner of the great master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights who are serious and solemn are very friendly to these believers on weekdays, and they do not see the power of these knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today at this time and here, Kas saw it, and he also learned more intuitively about the infinite power of the Great Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Test the mysterious power of my Lord! Then fear it! Pay attention!" Kass suddenly opened his arms and his face was full of enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sounds like Iyeta, Duke and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they know clearly, Kas is not lying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the fog in the sky rolls over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke and others saw that the mighty wolf knights of the martial arts took off from the battleships with a stream of blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost wolf stepped on the air and ran to the ground in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance is getting closer and closer, and everyone on the ground feels that the pressure of terror is getting bigger and bigger and more and more horrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment when the knights landed, even Iyeta, Duke and others could not help but kneel on the ground and worship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that still stands is Kas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass came forward with devoutness and nodded slightly toward the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights know Kas, and when they summon, they already know the cause and effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cas, you are doing very well!" A knight turned and walked down with a thumbs up and affirmation in his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is the greatest honour of my life to be able to preach the power of my Lord," Kass said earnestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a false one, but a sincere heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, on who you have, you have a god as a patron, that sense of security and glory, almost can not wait to be in front of all human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white-haired knight nodded affirmatively and then solemnly said: "You can go back first. My Lord and the Pope are very satisfied with your performance. The Pope is ready to reward you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass did not quit after listening, but accepted the ceremony and accepted it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the doctrine of the church of the late bell, and all hypocritical resignations are awkward to the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Kas’s body disappeared into the fog, Iyeta and Duke and others were uneasy, after all, they were not familiar with these knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
