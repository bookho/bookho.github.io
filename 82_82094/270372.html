			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, this question is over, my thoughts have been missed by you." Su Ge sighed helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina is a little embarrassed, she now feels that she just thought more, Su Ge did not mean that to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My meaning is very simple. I came here for the first time. I am not very clear about the situation here, so I want you to tell me about the situation in the capital city. After all, I am planning to rush to the capital city today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are going to the capital?" Elena sneaked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and asked: "How? Is the city completely blocked by the Duke of the Mountain? Or is it very dangerous now?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina immediately shook her head: "Of course not, the city is much safer than the outside, and the Queen's rule is much higher than the Duke of the Mountain."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for the road, the Duke of the Mountain can not block the road of trade. The World Trade Act is protected by the Steam Association, the World Business Coalition, and the world's three major international banks, even if there is any contradiction in any war. It can't stop the innocent merchants' business, otherwise they will be sanctioned by the most terrible economic, scientific, and financial aspects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Elena added: " At least they didn’t dare on the surface.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shu’s eyes flashed a glimmer of light, and asked casually: “So, are you coming out of the capital?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina is not concealing, generous little "Yes, I came out to investigate the evidence of collusion between the Duke of the Mountain and the Institute of Polar Studies and find out how they made the werewolves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! Can't see it, you are still a police detective." Su Ge said with a blank face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina does not explain, the topic of conversion: "If you want to go to the capital, then I am ready to return to the capital. If you don't mind, we Can be peered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge was very happy after listening to nature. He smiled and said: "Beautiful and kind ladies, the goddess will shelter you safely and illuminate the path you sneak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I don't believe in the goddess of March, thank you." Elena said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that she has a very serious prejudice against the March church. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two people cleaned up and left the hotel to get out of town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way to the peer, two people briefly introduced each other, Su Ge said his real name, and preached that he was a businessman, and the rest did not say much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina’s full name is Jelena Fu Gesen, not a native of Guinness, but actually from the Belland Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina’s past she did not say, but Suge looked out, she is completely different from the little girl like Hills and Bernice, she is Real old rivers and lakes, and have a very deep mystery experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked side by side on the street and could see soldiers patrolling everywhere on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because according to official preaching, four unscrupulous researchers were brutally killed by a witch lurking in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The damn witch! Why is this animal still alive in the world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flame The god is on, burn the world's witch with flames!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the lost soul be redeemed, may all the witches die, die After being sent to hell, eternal suffering from endless flames"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the road, while the contents of the pedestrian discussion are vicious, it is also extremely harsh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of these curses, Elena looks as usual, as if they are not talking about themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, she looked relaxed and looked at her in front of her lips and said, "Some of the memories are in the city, and I must drink enough this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge The heart secretly admire her heart, and asked: "Why should you go out of town next? If the Institute of Polar Studies and the Duke of the Mountain collude, you will know your attire and look."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene’s mysterious smile said: “Go out along the gates, I have my own way.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart Some curious, but didn't ask much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After about ten minutes of advancement, the two men quietly separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge first found the team yesterday, hiding the equipment again, sitting in the carriage and following the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The main reason for the witch's loss of control should be because of the sarcoma of their chest. From the point of view, the sarcoma seems to control all parts of the witch's body, no Allow any outsider. Once there is any outsider entering, there will be a huge reaction and get out of control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this Suge leaning on the back of the back:" What exactly is that thing?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, the group walked out of the city with no danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inspection out of the city is no simpler than when entering the city, and even the prosecutor will check the odds of entering the city yesterday to determine if you have anything to carry out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going out of Yumu City, walking along the big river, the tall capital city wall can already be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, it is clearer that the smoke of war is scattered around the city, but there are not many soldiers around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war here is not like the ancient attack and defense warfare that guards the gates of the city, but is close to the current small-scale battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including penetration, street fighting, information, assassination, etc., and the few soldiers around are just proclaiming their own advantages and people in the city. Deterrence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
