			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of mystery, even if there is a holy grail, Su Ge can not communicate with the Holy Grail and thus the ability to launch the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he is in his own identity, the original appearance, and everything belonging to Suger Sotos is in this dangerous city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunshine and ambiguous, the weather is pleasant, Sug walks on the wide and bustling street, looks up at the cloudless sky, squints, like the whole person They are all catering to the sun and enjoying the sunshine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now look at yourself, the sky of this world is not the blue of the earth, there is a touch of light green in the blue." Find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, even if he was flying in the air with an immortal dragon, he did not pay careful attention to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, just like a child who only knows the secrets that he knows, Su Ge laughs very purely and satisfactorily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedestrian passing by looked at the smirking Su Ge brows in the sky, and muttered in his mouth: "Whose silly boy is this?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug does not care about these things, he put his hands behind him, and he walks on the streets that have been going many times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While walking, Su Ge savors the world's grass and trees, one brick and one tile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that the street paving slate has a special wavy texture and the material is as solid as marble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also found that the buildings around the street are very neat, just south and north, east and west, two intersecting crossroads, absolutely perpendicular to each other, no A slight deviation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also found that the trees on both sides of the road are roughly the same, but they are two varieties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only difference between the two trees is the root of the leaves, one is the vein with a triangle, which is called the March tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is very similar to the March sunflower tree, but the root of the book is not a triangle, but a diamond. This book is called Si Ling Kui. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two books are mixed together, and if you don’t calm yourself, you can’t see any difference at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The details determine success or failure, rushing to deal with the matter, what is the point?" Su Ge squat under a tree, gently put down a leaf, just to be A passing ant saw, happy to pick up this piece of crisp and complete leaves, moved to his own nest, dedicated to his own queen, dedicated to his own ethnic group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March Kwai is known as the goddess for the gift of the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the four spirits of the sunflower tree is artificially the goddess of the embarrassing thing, is the immortal existence of mimicking the gift of the goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this planting of so many March trees, the Church of the Holy Blood must have a deep meaning, and it is very likely that some forms of surgery will be formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no one thought that this cup, as the key to the pattern, contained small cracks that they did not notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these, Su Ge has no interest in managing, he is now immersed in his own small world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is here smiling at the ants who are slowly drifting away, muttering: "Even if the population is weaker, then vulnerable, and have a living Qualifications and values, ants, humans, too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After half an hour, Suge knocked on his legs and stood up, sitting aside On the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mysterious departure, the magic potion has also dissipated the body, and the strong body of the past has returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, his two legs are unconscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong? Young man?" The sound of an old man sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked up and saw a blue trousers, an old plaid shirt, a visor on his head, and a bucket in his hand. The old man with a fishing rod in his hand looked at himself with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man seems to have seventy or eighty, and must have white hair, wrinkles on his face, and a large skeleton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s very old, it’s a good spirit, and it looks good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said, "I'm fine, sir. I just stayed there for a long time, my legs were numb."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man snorted and sat down beside Suge and said with a smile: "You young people, you really don't understand and cherish your body. In a few years, you young people. It’s not like the old guys of us.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and looked at the young men and women on the street who were neat and tidy, and said: This is a fast time, and people are quick to take care of other things. Or money, or knowledge, or status, or rights. People only have these eyes, so they ignore many other things, even including Your own body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man followed and smiled: "Maybe like this old thing, nothing, there is this aging body left, so Cherish it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugyang raised his chin and looked at his fisherman and said: Less you still have it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man looked at the fish in his hand and laughed: "Yeah, I still have it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, he looked at his favorite fish that looked old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not rush to bid farewell to the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he believes that all causes will result in all the industry will be repaid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are you going to go fishing?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man turned his head and pointed to the old moat not far away and said: "On that piece, this year's tides are relatively early, and a large number of sea fish swim along the port. Inland rivers, the old moats and rivers opened a few days ago, and the stagnant water in the inner circulation finally has a new life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge follows the fingers of the old man Looking at it, the result did not see the sight that I hoped to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was dumb and laughed, and he was far from being mysterious. He could not strengthen his body function with intensive techniques. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let’s see it together?" The old man stood up and sent an invitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge quickly nodded and asked, "I will help you with your bucket!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old man smiled and shook his head: "I haven't gotten to the declining appearance, but you are a young man. I see that your face is a little white, your body is weak, don't let the wine color hollow out, or you will get old, bitter. It is yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has some unexpected questions: "Are you a doctor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Just as the old man said, Su Ge had just been hollowed out by a monk's goblin yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man stepped forward and said: "I am just a retired old watchmaker. Now there are too many young people like you who don’t know how to control. I know it when I see more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sighed: "Not every young person has such good self-control ability. If people can If you control your own desires, this day is too peaceful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man listened to some accidents and carefully looked at Su Ge for a while, watching Suger slow The posture of pacing, the calm manner, the deep eyes, how to look is not like a normal young man, but like an old man who is almost the same age as himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Young people, have you failed to do business? Or have you been hit hard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Su Ge's appearance at this time gives the old man a feeling of self-destruction after suffering setbacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and replied: "You can understand this too. On the night before, I lost everything I once proud of."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at Su Ge’s appearance at this time, the old man estimated that: “I can see that you should have been a very famous person.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and didn't talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time can't go backwards, and life can't come back. Since it has already happened, there is no need to continue to entangle, and it is the key to welcoming a new life." The old man said with a strong heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge walked with the old man and said with a smile: "I am already welcoming a new life."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man heard a glimpse and smiled: "Today's weather is good, it is a good day for fishing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What? Adults go out?" Cass heard Betty's words and was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty yelled: "Is there any problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." With Betty's cute hair, Kas swearing stuck in his throat and swallowed back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a deep breath, Cass explained: "The portrait of an adult is widely circulated in the Church of the Holy Blood. It is a wanted criminal. The adult who lost the mysterious means has lost. With the method of disguise, it is very easy for him to go out like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before hearing this, Betty blinked and opened her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are here, I am going to find it now." Kass finished, turned and ran out like a gust of wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Kas was looking for Su Ge, Su Ge was leisurely fishing for the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is a complete novice, and has no tools. At this time, sitting on a small bench, listening to the old man’s embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two people and clerics are looking at this side of the scene, not far from the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be him, is it right?" A strong, bearded policeman looked down at the photo in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a portrait of Su Ge or the bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although there have been some changes, it is true," said the companion on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clergyman whispered: "This traitor who joins the cult is very dangerous. You two don't want to act rashly. I will inform the headquarters now."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good! Even if I give my life, I will not let this guy continue to go unpunished." Jian Shuo police are full of determination and determination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church gave them the information that Su Ge was a traitor to the Church of the Holy Blood, and then joined the cult without evil, and the animals were not as good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing these, the two upright and dedicated police officers naturally hated Su Ge, and wished to rush to shoot Su Ge directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clergy here quietly ran out of the distance, releasing the secret connection to make the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the release, he also carefully watched Su Ge, for fear of any confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, Su Ge’s “fierce name” was demonized in this group of clerics who did not know the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, if you look crazy, you can kill people and even kill your family from your dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These constantly distorted rumors make these clergy very scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if they don’t know that Su Ge’s mystery has dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Discovered! Found! Found his trace of Suger Sotos!" After confirming that Su Ge has lost mystery, the church has already The shield of Su Ge’s name was revoked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The busy Laurie suddenly reacted and turned and rushed out: "Where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "An old moat, is fishing with an old man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is that old man?" Laurie picked up his secret treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clergy have already investigated: "The old man is Charlie Zhuo, a retired watchmaker, and his father is also a watchmaker..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The staff introduced it in detail. In the end, Laurie found that the old man had nothing to do with Su Ge. He was an ordinary person who could not be ordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Becoming an ordinary person is like being in the crowd?" Laurie took the cold light in his eyes and took him away quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the church, looking at the direction in which Laurie left, more than a dozen clergymen gathered together and looked down at each other and bowed their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They couldn’t connect that majestic, steadfast and kind person to the person described by the church that night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true Suger Sotos they know is completely different from what the church has advocated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional to their idols, the words that Father Sini had said at the time, caused some steadiness in their long-standing beliefs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We, is this really right?" A dozen people asked themselves at this time, and their hearts were full of uneasiness and self-blame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others don't know what to do, they can only fall into silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One side is the church that supports them all, one side is to save them, and to give up everything of their own, to defeat the "evil heresy" of the evil spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to ask Father Sini." A hunter said, turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just have no feelings, not the standard of black and white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the beginning, almost everyone else is like a savior, and ran out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old moat, Su Ge is smiling at the old man and picking up a sea fish with silver scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, today is really a good day, this second shot has caught this silver 鲢." Looking at the silver-white fish that keeps licking its tail in the air The old man is overjoyed and will soon pick up the fish and put it into the bucket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
