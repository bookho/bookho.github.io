			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After surpassing the three souls, Sugg sat on the bed and sorted out the message he just got. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It can be seen now, there is no plague of the werewolf. All people are injected with a potion to become a werewolf."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, they took a needle of blood after the werewolf turned, called the breath of death. Combined with the breath of the god of death before, these two There is either the same thing or some relationship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are two possibilities for attacking the palace. One is something special in the palace, and On the one hand, I want to catch Vanas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Finally, let the child be born..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; tidy up all the circumstances, Su Ge has some embryos in mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Guinness's people should have a breath of death in their bodies, but this breath can't be extracted under normal circumstances. But turning them into werewolves, concept The sneak can be used to extract this breath. Gather enough breath of death, and finally rush into the palace, through some means to let something come out as a baby."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This baby is not surprising and extremely troublesome." Su Ge thought about getting out of the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just out of the tent, just happened to meet two middle-aged people passing by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg looked up at the moment of the middle-aged man opposite, and immediately appeared fear and panic on his face, hurriedly lowered his hat and quickly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man across the street saw this, his eyes filled with doubts, shocks and incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is naturally a teacher before Su Ge, John Ross. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point he turned around with Su Ge’s figure and watched Su Ge leave in the direction of returning to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"John, you know!?" The fat middle-aged man frowned slightly, and the small eyes in the middle of the fat were a little puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John then returned to God and quickly sorted out his mentality to return to calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First to the middle-aged man nodded slightly, his face was a little cold and stared at Su Ge’s back and said: "He was one of my apprentices in the Berant Empire. But I remember that he was dead at the time, and I was still in the wilderness by my own hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man heard a flash of cold in his eyes: "Since he appeared Here, it shows that he is a royal family. If you know it, it is very likely to be a bad thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John nodded slightly, pinching the cane in his hand: "Can't let it go "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is afraid of you when he sees it, and he should have a very strong fear for you. If this is the case, then catch up and deal with him." Let's go." The middle-aged man said casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John agrees: "But you can't kill, grab it first. I want to study how he survived. At the time, I checked very carefully. He definitely already Dead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two people left here, far behind Su Ge quickly moved forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former Sug saw a sneer in the corners of his two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"John's status is similar to that of Pete, and even if he is caught and tortured, he will not get any useful information. If this is the case, then put a long line and catch a big fish. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge thought, passing through a junction and quickly turned into a small alley, and then the bells in his mind spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The precise radar with a radius of 20 meters accurately presents all the buildings and passages around it in the mind of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge travels flexibly along the complex and winding alley path, while sensing something through the bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about five minutes, Su Ge seems to have sensed something, and his mouth slightly curled up with a smile: "Ready to end."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After turning around, Su Ge walked into a dead end full of ruin tiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing here for three minutes, John's two talents are catching up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing the footsteps, Su Ge turned around with a hurried turn to go out, but once again hit the two men who were slightly gasping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Su Ge took a few steps back and panicked, his face pale, his mouth flustered and said: "Teacher! Teacher, don't kill me! I don't know anything!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This expression, tone and movement is incomparably vivid, just like he once again returned to the ordinary person who was scared every day and could not do anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Su Ge look like this, John’s mouth is a little smirk: “Sug, it’s almost half a year gone, why didn’t you escape from my hand? A little progress?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's body is constantly retreating, sticking to the wall and speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power of our death sect is beyond your imagination. I am an ignorant student. Do you think that you can escape from the northeastern province and escape our control?" At this time, the face is proud, high above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road, he made up his own state of Suge for a few months based on Su Ge’s appearance and demeanor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After pretending to escape, he feared the strength of the death sect in Bain City. He did not dare to survive. He fled to the Guinness Kingdom to escape, but today he accidentally crashed. I am here. At this moment, John thought that Su Ge didn't know anything. In a few words, he described the death sect as a behemoth of sphere of influence covering the entire northeastern province and the kingdom of Guinness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man on the side looked at John and his face flashed a sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is not attached to our research institute, your death sect has already collapsed!" Middle-aged people thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that John is scaring Su Ge, but he sees the proud expression of John’s face as if he is real, only feeling deep irony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
