			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mind, the black big clock slowly made a thick bell, and these bells continually echoed in the mind, forming a loop of circles. He is endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time doesn't know how long it has been, suddenly screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg seems to feel something broken, and the special ripples of the bell actually blend into his own psionic power, giving his psionics a special Variety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knowledge is integrated into the psionics to form the realization of knowledge. This is a sign that the apprentice enters the profession." Su Ge is full of surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending on the rating level, each promotion is an iconic event, or a change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire apprenticeship is a process of accumulating knowledge and psionic power. When this process is sufficient, the apprentice begins to gradually master the knowledge, and when the knowledge is controlled, it is the embodiment of the knowledge. At this time, the apprentice will enter the field of occupation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The notes and experience of the predecessors really do more with less, the priest has not yet moved, this night's prisoner took the lead to enter the professional level." Su Ge opened his eyes The state of mind is full of happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the professional level means having enough fighting means and capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, apprenticeships and careers vary greatly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pick up the cane and mix it with the bell to inject it into the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the whole cane began to vibrate violently, as if it was covered with a layer of frosted glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vibration is the rhythm of the late bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Transformation!" Su Ge said, suddenly the vibration began to change into a large number of invisible sound waves, making the cane become a handful of sharp blades Mace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissipating the psionic power, the vibration of the cane gradually stopped, and Sug licked some of the numb hands and spit out a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this case, the next step is more emboldened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;叮叮叮... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorbell suddenly rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug quickly walked downstairs to open the door and found that standing at the door was a young woman who was full of youthful vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? How can our busy people suddenly appear in front of my house?" Su Ge let the body open to welcome Sister Julie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;佘丽尔 smiled and revealed two beautiful dimples: "I am very busy, there is time to come to you to play. Today I am in the mission department. When it’s bad, the church has just officially assigned you a mysterious mission.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Julie took a good texture from the black backpack at the waist. Envelope with dark red shades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The envelope is sealed with a lacquer, engraved with the coat of arms of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took the channel thanks: "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry up! Don't lose face to me in this issue!" After that, Julie turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close the door, Sug took the knife and cut the lacquer, and took out a gray stationery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not much content inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Sug Sotos, Hello, the Purple Moon Walker of the Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a pleasure to inform you that the goddess’ people need your help to solve this problem, and you will probably win the favor of the goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Location: Seven kilometers northeast of the city, Laihua Village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time: At 8:00 tomorrow morning, take the church carriage and depart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mission Description: With the advent of the Spring Festival, the sleeping beasts gradually wake up, and there are some low-level monsters that wake up. Recently, Laihua Village was attacked by small blood bats. It seems that there are still water ghosts around. Please be careful after arrival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task Objective 1: Help the villagers to dispose of the nearby dens of the small blood bat and bring back the corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task Objective 2: Determine the location and habits of the water ghosts, and cruelly bring them back to the water ghost ears when they are sure. If you are not sure, please ask the headquarters for assistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking forward to your good news, the goddess of devout believers, may the light of the goddess illuminate the path of your journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payment is the bishop of the Church of the Holy Blood, Bain City: Laurin Kenan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Putting the letter back in the envelope, Su Ge said in a wave: "It’s finally my turn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;With no time left, Sug turned his head and began preparing the props that he had used in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small blood bat, first-class monster, very aggressive, sucking human blood, the main spreader of the plague, only three fingers in size, night action Digging a cave to build a nest, usually about a nest of about 50, ruled by a bat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The small blood bat is very demanding for oxygen Big, so very afraid of smoke. Do not like vinegar, soft body, very afraid of physical cutting attacks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the mind about small blood bats Information, Su Ge first prepared five fire charms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The water ghost belongs to the second-level mysterious creature, and it needs to be a sight of 21 points. A few mysterious creatures who ignore the rules of fearlessness, non-beasts, eat people, can't grow Time is out of the water, often appearing along the river, the body is slightly smaller than humans, but the muscle strength is higher than that of humans. Generally, five groups live in groups, nesting in the ground, and the territory is very strong and can understand the human language."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Weak mine, fear of mercury, weak parts similar to humans, low IQ, water ghost brain, liver, and eyeballs are secondary mysterious materials with high value." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most effective means for the water ghost is the mercury potion." Su Ge thought of taking two bottles from the side, with silvery white weird liquid inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the weak thunder is carried, a few bonuses can have a miraculous effect. Then, with a bunch of black wool, the lizard blood is used to make a temporary magic for the investigation. The ceremonial material only needs to bring the core bull horn and a bottle of night vanilla, and the remaining common materials can be taken from there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning what he needs into the backpack, Su Ge nodded with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next, let's practice the use of the sound of the late bell! Don't drop the chain at the crucial moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Sug wore a relatively light and thin white shirt with a robes on the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being backpacked, with two haes came to the east gate of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black wagon with a badge of the Holy Blood Church has been waiting there quietly, and the uncle’s enthusiasm for Su Ge wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long breath, Sug quickly took the carriage and went to his mission location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, it was very calm. The carriage was the official road. Although it was muddy and muddy, it was still flat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the window, I couldn’t see any scenery except the melting snow. Su Ge looked at his eyes and regained his eyes and closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hour later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage stopped at a village near the foot of a low hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The village is not small, it seems that there should be more than one hundred families. The houses are made of stone and formed into small buildings. The internal roads are criss-crossed. Although the road surface is very muddy, it is generally very neat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road, many villagers have now moved back and forth, and they generally hold or carry some heavy things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
