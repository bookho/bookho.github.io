			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church of the Holy Blood Church is very large, 40 meters high from the ground to the dome. The space is cylindrical and the inside is at least fifty meters in diameter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a neat shelf around the vast space with books full of books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These books are new and old, they are big and small. At this time, they are neatly placed in different categories, which makes people look very comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large pillar with a straight through the dome in the middle of the space. The pillar is surrounded by a spiral wide staircase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stairs 蜿蜒 upward, extending about thirty suspended steel escalators leading to the hanging gallery in front of the high-altitude bookshelf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge looked up and saw this scene, suddenly shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this intricate and exquisite library, Su Ge exclaimed: "It’s awesome!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Anthony smiled and said: "This is not just a library. The pillar in the middle is a huge organ. When it is dangerous, you can turn it directly and send the person above to the top of the dome. The stairs below will not let the things below come up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Things!" Su Ge heard a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that this defensive measure is not for people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time in the library There are quite a few people who seem to have twenty or thirty people. Most of them are wearing white coats of medical staff, and the rest are clergymen wearing robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the future, you can freely enter and exit here 24 hours a day. No one is qualified to stop you from reading here," Anthony said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge regained his gaze and temporarily suppressed his inner desire to say, "Where are we going next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "First look at the entire church road and some iconic buildings, they can make you get lost as little as possible, then take you to the logistics department to do the equipment collection and registration, go to the finance department to fill out the salary Account and collect your salary as a police detective. Of course, you can also pay half a month's salary to solve the urgent need. Finally, go to the battle field to register, in the future you need high-intensity combat training or shooting training. Finally, go to your future office area and the introduction is complete."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded. "That is really bothering you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the library, two people bent around and came to the backyard of the cathedral. Three-story building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This building is indeed some, because Su Ge is completely circumscribed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the logistics department. It’s a hall. There are very few people inside. Only two middle-aged nuns bow their heads to sort out something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no mention after the two people came. After registering, Su Ge got two silver-gray suitcases with relevant equipment in them. There is not much difference between the last box and the overall identity of the clothes, tokens, pendants, weapons, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving here, two people circled three small squares in the direction of the sun and came to a two-story building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The layout here is somewhat like a bank, surrounded by counters, with iron fences in the middle, only a small window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nun who works inside has been instructed to register and record the information related to Su Ge’s proficiency, and at the same time generously gave Su Ge a detective. Half-monthly wages, as well as half-monthly wages that are required to be advanced at Soge, total: 28 francs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s smile puts this banknote in his arms, like a child who eats sugar, and smiles very brightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving here, the two continued to follow the direction of the sun for about ten minutes and came to a prototype building like a small stadium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building looks like a flat prototype pie, three layers up and down. The whole body is made of solid bluestone and is very strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here is the training ground, you can exercise here, practice shooting and other related techniques." Anthony said, with Su Ge ready to go in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked up at the time and smiled and said: "Since I know the location, I have time to come by myself. I am familiar with my future. Work area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, it's OK. As long as you hold an identity card, you can always do all the training here for free." Anthony said, with Su Ge turning around and turning around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The area where you work is close to the east gate of the Church of the Holy Blood, and is closer to the Holy Blood Library." Two people pass through the winding road. Four small squares and five stone arches came to the chapel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This church is small and simple, with a gray rock. It looks like only three stories high, and the top spire height is about ten meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chapel has only one small main entrance and only six windows on the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony took out a black key full of complicated lines and grooves and inserted it into the door, silently opening the ironwood door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a mysterious workshop for the work of the purple moon travellers. Since many purple moon travellers like to study technology and mystery, so need sufficient The instruments and spaces carry out related experiments and exercises."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge followed and walked in. The first thing I saw was a very empty hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neat workbench around the hall is covered with a curtain, and the open space gives a trace of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This has been abandoned for two years, and no one has been used. The instruments and related things inside have been removed, leaving only ordinary furniture. If you If you need any instrument, you can apply to the Holy See, usually it will be delivered the next day." Anthony sighed with a slight emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg nodded and walked along and looked around. The first floor had a total of five rooms, the second floor was four rooms, and the single floor area. About three hundred pings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is ruined, the overall facilities are very comprehensive. If it is not a church, it is a delicate villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This key is for you, don't lose it." Father Anthony handed over the key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took the key and said seriously: "I will not live up to the expectations of the bishop and master Geros."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
