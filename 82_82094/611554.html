			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the posture of Iyeta and hearing her eager voice, Shirley said indifferently: "This is what the worm should behave." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing this utter disdain, the words of anger, Ieta was deeply relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she knew that she had seized the hope of living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Su Ge’s voice came: "I like to talk to real smart people. And true smart people can recognize their essence." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Ieta lowered her head and said with a serious tone: "Please expressly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg spread his arms on the back of the sofa and said casually: "First of all, you need to recognize that you can live to the present is not how good and important you are. Just because I have some female warlocks Subordinates, so the impression of the female warlock is not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Iyeta’s eyes are slightly enlarged: "One...some!?"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her impression, no female warlock is willing to accept a man to control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not say much: "If you perform well enough, you may have the chance to see my loyal, a lord-level warlock." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Ieta’s eyes tightened like nails, and my heart began to fall into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord's Warlock! ? What is that concept? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a female warlock in her teens to the current thirty-six years of mysterious career, she has never seen a lord-level warlock, only seen a small amount Master level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not give her too much time to think, faintly asked: "What is your purpose for this time?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta answered honestly and earnestly: "To meet with the legendary Admiral, we need to ship a special batch of goods to the north wind continent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge thought quickly Rotate, the tone said casually: "Prepare for the restoration of the country!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Iyerta suddenly trembled, whispering: "You know clearly "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart move: "I didn’t expect it to be true. Then the female warlock on the emperor’s side has a certain relationship with her. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also had some female warlocks who were not allowed to belong to what faction, and the situation in the country was only heard by Albert and Bernice. been. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just intended to swindle, I didn’t expect it to be true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that the things of the ancient city, so many small bugs saw hope." Xue Lier on the side of the cold inserted a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta did not dare to answer, bowed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continues to ask: "What is your relationship with Harriman May?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen To Su Ge’s precise mention of the name, Ieta’s heart is more awe-inspiring and hurriedly said: “She is my boss, and we have been working for the resurrection of the female warlock for many years.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop, Iyeta tempted: "Do you know Ms. Mei?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge casually said: "I don't know." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just a disgusting little bug." Shelly said disgustedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge picked up the coffee: "It’s unfortunate that she provoked us a few days ago."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this Yeta, I was full of horror, and my lips were trembling and I couldn’t speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge's dark eyes carry a kind of high indifference: "So, in the future, your dreams will come to an end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;吱呀......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta leaned on the sofa with a weak body, and the whole person seemed to lose the support of the bones, and the softness could not move there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug does not want to say more, stand up and say: "Your life, I accepted. I hope you do not make some unreasonable things. If there are things that make me not very happy, the result is not just as simple as your dreams are broken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, smart people, don't be confused Oh!" Finally, Sug glanced at her and walked out of the private room with Shelly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta’s sluggishness is there, and the whole body is soft and loses control of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has experienced countless catastrophes, lost hope, lost her dreams, and even lost everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Iyeta was able to return to the private room, walked out of the private room, and came to the deck, watching the sea mutter: If I lose those, do I still have the meaning to continue to live?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, her heart suddenly produced some special thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I advise you not to move those bad ideas." A voice suddenly came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this voice, she turned her head and saw Albert standing beside her, some old faces with some warnings. mean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta sorted out his own look and said with a deep breath: "Hello, Mr. Albert."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last time I met was ten years ago!" Albert said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta nodded: "Yeah, thank you for your help, let me and my students escape the healing of the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert looked at the sea with his hands on the railing and said with a slight emotion: "A decade has passed, and you should come out of that ridiculous mission."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp I&#;&nbsp;Iyeta said bitterly: "I was instilled in this thought since I was a child. Although I am afraid of death, if we really don't have that kind of mission, do we still have the meaning of living?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert did not answer: "Who knows, it depends on yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yetta silently said: "You seem to be very familiar with that one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not familiar, but has seen his heroic attitude." Specially said, he looked up slightly and looked at the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year and a half passed, and he still can’t forget the cool back of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell is he? He actually said...he wants to control the integration of the female warlocks." Ieta voice asked with prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert looked at her and answered seriously: "This is also the reason why I came here. As an old knowledge, I don't want you to die." So unclear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta answered seriously: "Please enlighten me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Albert said with deep awe: "He is who I can't say, I can only say that what he said is true. And his real power is far beyond the limits of your imagination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Ieta’s eyes are getting bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things you hear from Albert's mouth are completely different from the concepts and meanings you hear from Suge's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very aware of Albert’s personality and is well aware of Albert’s status and strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is not your enemy, you have to remember this deeply." Albert seriously warned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
