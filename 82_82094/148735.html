			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running forward quickly, in less than two minutes, the group came to the street outside the farm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point you can see that the entire farm is wrapped in a weird green mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of these green fogs, all life dies and the land withers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't go in, don't get close! These are the fuels of the original fire, and once we get close we will be quickly sucked up by these fuels." Bart stepped forward, Advance in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Save...Save..." At this time an obese figure crawled hard on the ground and wanted to climb out of the strange fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s Morgan!" Sug recognized the obese man as the head of the circus, Mr. Morgan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state of Morgan is very bad at this time, the clothes and skin of the whole body are very corroded, and the obese body is broken down into green particles at the speed visible to the naked eye. in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Save me, beg you to save me..." Morgan climbed and pleaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stood outside and was unmoved, sighing: "Sorry, save your life before you save your life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morgan has not heard it. At this time, the two eyes fall out of the eyelids and break down into green particles without falling, and dissipate in the air, which looks very scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug found that his vision had risen a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Betray the heresy of my Lord, do you still dare to destroy the Lord's coming ritual with the infidels?" The gloomy voice sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned his head and saw an old man with seven or eight people staring blankly at this side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Tyran? Are you a traitor who dares to appear in front of me?" Bart’s face was also very gloomy, and he took out his mysterious gift cane. Staring at Tyran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The one who killed us and brought the police over is also you?" On the other side, three people with three strange necks with a weird bronze medal and a gloomy face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge naturally recognizes this bronze medal, which is the symbol of the Institute of Polar Studies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are really ready." Su Ge squeezed his hand and said lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tylan stared at Su Ge: "Since the female warlock suddenly turned against water to help you kill Glyman, I naturally have to be prepared."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you let those ghouls lead her away?" Su Ge whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tylan is not going to waste time, no answer, raises his hand and says to the six people behind him: "Kill them!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Tyran put his hands on his chest and whispered two sentences, and suddenly a gust of wind blew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, Sugton felt the hair behind his neck slowly erect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he feels an invisible force blowing in his neck behind his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like being followed by a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be careful, he is a spiritist, good at using the soul to fight." Bart's hands burned a green flame and strode over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the momentum, it seems that one person must kill all eight people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge’s momentary opening of the vision suddenly turned, and the next second he suddenly saw a phantom, and the horrible evil spirit was staring at him. Be yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I fuck!" In an instant, Su Ge was scared and completely frowned, and the body suddenly stepped back two steps, while reading the quiet rumors to calm down the spirit of panic. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Apostle!" Two of the Hills ran over and held Su Ge around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the two people did not fully perceive the scary evil spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the evil spirits easily passed through the bodies of the two witches, and once again came to the front of Su Ge, raised his claws and grabbed the head of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" At this time, the spirit of Su Ge calmed down a lot, suddenly snorted through the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the sound waves formed by the psionic energy are rippled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After being hit by these sharp ripples, the evil spirit suddenly made a miserable scream and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!" Hilles screamed and his body turned and held Sug in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is a little embarrassed to ask: "What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedicts With the fingers, two steel marbles embedded in the scales behind Hills were flying into her hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Arms!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, Su Ge suddenly figured it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that now everyone is eager to go on, and I am now the common enemy of these four cult organizations!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge turned his head and looked at the dark night: "The three assassins are now two, Sears, Bernice, to find the two assassins Come out and kill!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two witches nodded immediately after listening, turned and rushed straight out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning your attention to the people in front of the three polar institutes, Su Ge said faintly: "Your ignorance and ignorance make me very upset. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three listened to the open mouth, and two of them took out the bone-shaped knife made of human bones from their arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the body quickly rushed to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be a mysterious person who is good at body skills." Seeing this Su Ge pinching his cane tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the three people took out a flute made of a human leg bone and put it on the mouth and gently blew it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Musician!?" It sounded like a melodious song, and immediately into the ear of Su Ge turned into an indescribable thorn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of 嘶吼 sounds very horrible, and the spirit of listening makes people feel trembling and uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quiet!" Su Ge opened his mouth and said to the man who played the flute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two words mobilize most of Suge's psionic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of these psionics is to produce special sound fluctuations that pass through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing Su Ge, this is like a teacher teaching the voice of a student, this The musicians of the Institute of Polar Studies suddenly sounded an indescribable harsh sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This harsh sound is very strange and ugly, as if countless weird and squeezing things are squeezing together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, this strange voice is extremely fearful and irritating, as it is behind what represents something unspeakable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the musician found that his vision suddenly rose by nine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music came to an abrupt end, a heartbreaking scream, full of horrified screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music, temporarily caught in a state of mental frenzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!?" The two people who were already close to Su Ge heard the screams of their companions suddenly, and they completely wondered what happened. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
