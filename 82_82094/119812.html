			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two-step squatting Su Ge, who felt his head burst, almost sat down on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the imaginary hypnotist like a ghost looks at Su Ge in a cold manner: "I won’t let you go so easily, little guy. I want to take you The pain that has just caused me is back to you thousands of times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the hypnotist did not continue nonsense, and there was no stop, the green short knife in the hand was inserted again. To the chest of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Geqiang endured severe pain and shouted: "Luobo!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜呜......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the scream of Su Ge, the dark fog does not know where the wolf is coming from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"?" The hypnotist looked awkward, but his hands were not idle, and the knife was inserted directly into the chest of Sug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grass! How is it different from the animation!" Su Ge felt that he had two sweats all over his body, sitting on the ground with powerlessness, standing for a while Not up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, two dark blue wildfires gradually appeared in the dark fog. The two wildfires held a cold stream of light under high-speed movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How does it appear in your consciousness!?" The hypnotist was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the nightmare of the world who controls the world, which is invisible to the naked eye, but he can see through consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing that runs in the fog is the dog that has been with this apprentice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This guy, weird!" The hypnotist thought, raising the knife again, ready to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green short knife is raised high, this time it is not the chest of Su Ge, but the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This knife went down and absolutely pierced the brain of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far from Loboton, I felt the danger of my master. The hair on my body turned into a cold wind, and the whole body flew completely in the fog. Like the arrow of the string, in the blink of an eye, it was in front of the hypnotist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the lobo’s mouth bite the hand of the hypnotist holding the weapon, then the head twists and the body turns in a circle, actually it will The hypnotist gave him a break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is guarded by Su Ge, open his mouth, revealing awkward The teeth, the hair that is full of cold wind, dance like a flame in the air, looks very handsome and majestic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hypnotist who was thrown out floated in midair, watching the icy right arm, and his face was ugly, and immediately closed his eyes and read words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Invincible, I am invincible, my god of the world, I am the nightmare of this world... Now I command this world and heal my wounds!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With constant psychological cues and hypnosis, professional-level hypnotists show their powerful mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, the ice disappeared and his arm returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up at Su Ge, who was protected by Lobo, the hypnotist’s face was even more ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My psionics are almost exhausted, and I can only launch a privilege. The whole nightmare world has the possibility of collapse. It must be quick!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, the hypnotist fell on Lobo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The apprentice is not worth mentioning, the real trouble is this dog, then the dog will be exiled first!" The hypnotist thought, launching again Your own hypnotic suggestive ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I commanded the world to expel this dog!" The hypnotist was hysterical at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the whole foggy world began to tumbling rapidly, and then suddenly formed a big hand and grabbed Luobo suddenly. Actually, I suddenly took out Luobo and didn't know where I went. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, with the advancement of knowledge, the consumption of this exile is much smaller than imagined." The hypnotist feels that he is now more comfortable and calm. Quite a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge reluctantly returned to God at this time, watching Luo Bo’s heart disappearing into the bottom of the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This feeling of distortion is like a twisted nightmare," Suge murmured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hypnotist flew over at this moment, his face proudly said: "It is not like, but the fact. Your consciousness is now immersed in the nightmare I created, and I It is the ruler here! God here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug struggled to raise his head and looked at the hypnotist, asking weakly: "That is to say I am now Are you dreaming? Are you hypnotized in your dreams?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hypnotist came over and pinched Suger’s neck and said, “You can understand this too, now surrender Let me have a strong knowledge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge’s mouth curled up and suddenly a laugh came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you laughing at?" The hypnotist said, and it was a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger completely ignored the knife at this time, and said plainly: "Thank you for reminding me, 蝼 ants."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"蝼蚁!?" Hearing the word, the hypnotist's face suddenly distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he feels that Su Ge is defying himself, this is a huge humiliation for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know what you are doing now??" The hypnotist struggled with his face and began to madly slam the body of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg seems to be completely afraid of this pain, and calmly said: "Your hypnosis is very successful, let me think that I am still in reality, not In my dreams, your hints and hypnosis have affected my judgment and even suppressed some of my instinctive memories."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you are still too confident, and actually told me that this is a dream world." Su Ge said, raising his hand and holding the hypnotist's wrist with a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"!!!" The hypnotist suddenly opened his eyes and was incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can he reach me!??"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a stop for Su Ge Just weak and wilting, some are a kind of high indifference and the dissatisfaction of the superior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You seem to claim that you are the master of this world, the god of this world, I really don't know how high!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is getting colder and the tone is getting worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point the hypnotist has felt the pressure and clenched his teeth: "What the hell are you? You are definitely not an ordinary apprentice!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the hypnotist finally realized that something was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s mouth tilted slightly, and the chin was slightly indifferent and said: “You are not qualified to know what kind of existence I am.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Su Ge raised his hand and said faintly: "The soldiers from the Abyss Valley, come on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;呼呼呼......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the passage of this sentence, the whole fog has blown the cold wind, and the sky has snowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distant bell does not know where it came from, and suddenly it sounds in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the horror, the hypnotist seemed to feel something through mastery of the world, so he instinctively looked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is!!!" The hypnotist's eyes widened, his mouth instinct rose, and his spirit was completely stunned, as stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
