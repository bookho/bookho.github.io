			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when the rain in the sky has stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tick! Tick! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water on the eaves descended on the deck along the eaves, making a crisp sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood still in the same place, at this time he looked calm and elegant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the black suit has been wet, it does not affect his mystery and power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain has stopped, but the air is still wet, and numerous tiny water molecules are floating in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the secret peeping, at this time fuzzy seeing there are more than a dozen very blurred traces in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trace seems to be the trace of something flying at a very fast speed, and it seems to be a crack in the cutting space of some sharp thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter what, everyone realizes a cruel fact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the mysterious person who has terrorist fighting power in the true sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They used to think that the masters of the demon hunters were. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, right here, they think they are so naive, so naive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge has no limits, knowledge has countless possibilities, no one can think of it, it seems very simple vibration knowledge, can develop to such a horrible, even It is incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class opened their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert blinked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta blinked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moss also blinked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as an ordinary person, Macock blinked, for fear that he had just seen the illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he obviously sees it, here Su Ge wields his long sword, and with the sword waving, more than a dozen invisible sharp edges are like cutting The space is average. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sound of subtle vibrations, the invisible sharp edge cuts the falling rain, cuts the damp air, sweeps at a very fast speed However, it disappeared and disappeared, leaving only the shallow traces of today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that?" asked Macock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ban mutter said: "It’s Jianguang... No... No... Accurately, it should be Jianqi.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sword, this word is very appropriate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What ordinary people can't see, these mysterious people see very clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, on the deck a few meters away from Su Ge, the bodies of more than a dozen sirens fell there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Krakens have no wounds on their bodies, but they have all died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Albert clearly knows that the internal organs of these Krakens have been completely shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword that Sug fired out was not sharp enough to cut the power of steel, but the sigh of sighs with horror and vibration can be transmitted to the body through scales. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amplitude and volatility reach a horrible wave that can instantly shatter those fragile internal organs after passing through the scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His knowledge is actually a shock? But this level of vibration knowledge is too horrible!" Moss eyes widened at this time, feeling the scalp for a while Hemp, a violent sense of crisis is filled with his spirit, because this swordsman master is really terrible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't understand the principles and just the swordsmanship, but the efficiency of this killing alone has left 90% of the mysterious people in the mysterious world behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This guy is simply killing the machine!" Moss's hand holding the pen was a little trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert’s face is incredible, he is a senior master, so he can understand the whole process of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of attack is simply impossible!" Albert murmured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can clearly feel that the whole vibration is emitted from the body of Su Ge and transmitted to the sword through the arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible kinetic energy then accumulates on the sword, and the sword that keeps shaking is starting to shake the surrounding air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the adjustment of the psionic energy, when the kinetic energy is sufficient, the body, the long sword, and the amplitude of the air reach the same, Su Ge suddenly waved, and that appeared. It is full of swords of terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword is not flying forward, but passing forward through the transmission of vibration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air left is not the trace of the sword, but the aftermath of the vibration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process not only requires a lot of psionic power, but also absolutely fine control of vibration and psionic power, and even the movement of the body, the quality of the sword, Speed, precision and many other elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most crucial thing is that after he was ready, Su Ge swung a dozen times in a row and completely killed all the Krakens. This horrible control, This horrible precision, and the horrible spirit, made Albert feel unbelievable, and there is such a terrible existence in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ordinary vibrations can't have such a strong transitivity and persistence, and more kinetic energy savings will be consumed quickly in the transmission, let alone through this A variety of means of transmitting media that simultaneously resonate. Normal vibration, no matter how you save, it is impossible to form such a terrible attack, perhaps it may form a similar sword, but the effect on others, and blowing on him There is no difference in one breath. It is absolutely impossible to have such a terrible shock and penetration!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has studied academics for many years and has absolute confidence in these things. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does it mean that the vibration he produces is not an ordinary vibration!?" Albert suddenly thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone is deeply shocked and contemplative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;叮! A crisp sound sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people suddenly returned to God and turned their attention back to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, it was just that Su Ge had a long sword on the deck, and the sword became a silver-gray cane, looking ordinary. There is no difference in the cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s actually a cane in his hand!" Seeing this transformation, everyone was even more shocked, and deeply felt the unfathomableness of Su Ge. terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the metamorphosis of the sword, or the knowledge of vibration, or the powerful weapon that has never been seen before, everyone has made a deep impression on Su Ge. Fear, even fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, all the information is ready, Moss sighs with relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire information is divided into four pages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first page is the basic situation of Su Ge, the second page is the character and action mode of Su Ge, the third page is the knowledge of Su Ge, and the fourth page is the focus. Introducing the weapons of Sugna’s horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tonight, after sending these things out, start my plan!" Moss said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect him to be so strong, then he will definitely interfere with the plan of the Cthulhu Order. At that time, I only need to watch the movie in secret and give him Some little help is just fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is in his grasp these days, and now the victory is in sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the deck, Suge patted the rain on his body and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is exhausted now, and just the swords that look so handsome and mysterious consume all his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
