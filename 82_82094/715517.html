			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green General. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two pillars of the empire, by making the devil see the situation inside, leaned back on the chair, holding the coffee in his hand, but the heat It has dissipated, indicating that two people have kept this action for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statue-like action lasted for a dozen or more seconds, and the two players seemed to be back again, and the coffee that was delivered to the mouth I continued to take a sip and did not notice that the coffee was cold and hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mechanical put the cup down, the two looked at each other and saw that the other person’s expression was full of sluggishness and frightened horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The series of flips, a series of secrets, a series of violent materials made two people urinating (funny). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want to say?" Coase looked at Green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green shook his head: "The brain is blank, I don't know what to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coase nodded dullly: "Me too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two suddenly fell silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dozen seconds, the two people raised their heads with a tacit understanding, and at the same time said: "How is this tm possible??"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the voice of the other party, the two people are silent for a second, it is a bitter smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't think of dreams, the power of the church in the late hours will develop so much. In the case of no one knows, not only will a country completely penetrate, Even the anticoagulation has been Jerez.” Green took another sip of coffee and did not notice that he was drinking the most annoying cold coffee on weekdays. Cos sighed: "Who can think of it? I feel that except those who can predict the future, no one can think of it."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They can break the Church of the Holy Blood and have always been proud of their solid beliefs and turned them into fanatics on their own side. This brainwashing ability has gone far beyond humans." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green replied: "This is certainly not human ability, it is God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kos Turned to look at Green, did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green continues: "I have felt the power of terror. Su Ge has crossed thousands of kilometers with his own ability, ignoring my own will, God. Unconsciously invaded into my dreams."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Across thousands of kilometers? Ignore your wishes and perceptions!?" Coase heard this big Eyes, I feel that I have heard an unreal ghost story. Greener nodded seriously: "But this is not the most critical. The most important thing is that he is completely in control of my dreams. Killing me is just a matter of raising his hands. He You can even create the world in my dreams. With a wave of hands to change the structure of dreams, even a single finger can create many lifelike humans, wines and objects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My God, this ability has entered the level of the Great Sage, is the performance of the power of the rules!" Coase expression is full of shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green nodded: "But you and I are very clear, Su Ge is very powerful, but he is only a master, so..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are signs that a true God who can interfere with the real world is helping him." Coase said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Green nodded hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that all this will eventually become a battle between gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Two people are more clear about the means of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Elf Order and the Fortress, which have been closely related to the Church of the Night, have seen the ghosts at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They certainly have a good relationship with the late bell church, but they don’t know it for the members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, when I heard these messages, the only thing that made them figure out was why the late church taught the members’ confidentiality to such an extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of those core people, each one is likely to be the absolute core of the big organization today! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills and Vegniya are leaning on the chair with their legs crossed, and they have a small mouthful of wine, temperament and confidence, and their faces are full of pride. With pride, like two proud peacocks with open screens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...should not be a dream." The people of the Glorious Church muttered at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stand on the same line as the Church of the Holy Blood, which is a glory and a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight, the church is in the middle of most of the mysterious people, and hit the Church of the Holy Blood, and interrupted two important teeth. This level of embarrassment has even surpassed the consequences of the failure of the emperor of the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This group of guys will take too much time." The people of the Glorious Church felt a trace of fear inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening church attack time is too precise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the true core and main force of the Church of the Holy Blood has been isolated from the abyss, no matter what happens here, there will be no back defense. possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, with those elite sacred swords, these werewolves and vampires are not opponents at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the Holy Swords are for war forces dedicated to slaughtering these alien monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone fell into silence, the voice of Hills continued: "All eyes are open to me, and the really wonderful place has just begun. The glory of the Lord will break this desperate world, and the infinite gods will turn into the sun and shine through the whole world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What other means are you!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who watch the lively are roaring in their hearts. Just a series of ups and downs have made them somewhat unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle has started again on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not good! One hundred elite demon hunters under Jelos have all been rebellious and are attacking from the periphery!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time as the clergyman, the stray bullets, shells, poisonous gas, darts, forbidden magic bullets, and flash bombs were all thrown over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, the sluggish clergy did not even react, and was completely divided into lambs to be slaughtered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, the effect of Mil's top dragon potion has declined, but he can also take some other low-level potions, and the fighting power is still much more than the ordinary lords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the demon hunter Jackos, who has just arrived, is gaining momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He brought a mask of ghosts and gods symbolizing war, and drank a bottle of dark top dragon potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a lap of the whole body muscles, Gerlos’s mouth suddenly spit out a horrible chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These colds quickly fell, and actually formed a layer of hoarfrost on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not good! There is a special power in his body, his knowledge is already... close to the dominator!" The one-eyed archbishop is very keen, immediately Big shout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugrand said: "Jerousus is one of the most trusted people of my family, so he is qualified to be one of the four apostles under my command. Accepting the gift of Apocalypse, you are now no longer a lord of the lordship, but the lord of our Lord who symbolizes war and hunter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accompanied by the icy sound that came from the dark winter, just hearing it makes people feel cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, along with a fierce blizzard, Gerlos has appeared in the presence of three bishops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." The three men turned back in a very difficult time, staring at Jerez, who was close at hand, but completely fainted but not completely . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was a defeated man...this is impossible!" Laurie's eyes were full of bloodshot eyes, and his expression was abnormal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time in the ancient city, he pressed Jelos. If he takes it seriously, he can play three Gerlos at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, the situation has completely turned over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White Cream!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Gerlos only said two words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whistling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible ice aura with a weird frozen power It broke out instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than a second, the three lords have already felt that their body has been frozen halfway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of freezing is not a cold freezing, but the special aura gives them the concept of permanent freezing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half a second, they know that they will become ice sculptures and die for the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the critical moment, three people shouted at the same time: "Sky!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, a burst of dark blue light flashed through, and three strange meteors suddenly appeared in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes! It is a real meteor, and Su Ge can even see it clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with the three meteors, a special rhythm that Su Ge could feel from the sky appeared on the three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge realized his recovery from the sky, he found that the three bishops had disappeared in the same place, and came ten meters away, and looked at this with a shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the position of three people, left three blue stones full of pits and fists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the three stones have been completely frozen, and then cracked and cracked quickly, turning into ice slag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These three things... are somewhat similar to meteorites, but it's more like an amygdala." Sug touched his chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amygdala is an organ in the human head that primarily controls emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you use this world, human fear comes from this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three archbishops who were ten meters away were also frozen enough to tremble with each other and were very miserable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this another ability of the sky? Is this the replacement of the sky equal to the second life?" Su Ge found the sky mark The second is the ability to be abnormal. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Gerlos handled the three lords, Milton was liberated and turned to start his amazingly horrific killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a burst of poisonous tongue, more than a dozen members of the Holy See lost their fighting power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black pharaoh who looked at the situation in the distance said faintly: "Get it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When he heard the command of Black Pharaoh, the other two black figures around him appeared directly and rushed to the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Breaking!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Walter sheltered the next person, the flame dominator sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter’s right arm with a sickle slammed into a horrible flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a second, Father Water’s right arm disappeared completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, two attacks that people could not describe were offset by black fog, and only the people in the church at night felt a stinging sensation and no injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Father Water’s actions are not meaningless, and his dark fog protects his compatriots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who have not stopped to see their hands and see two other old men calmly blocking themselves between the two armies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are two dominators!" Mil's face is extremely dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are still ordinary old men, but one is wearing a luxurious silk robes, a well-dressed black suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are really idle, nothing, sensory dominator, airflow dominator." Walter said dignifiedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out, both of them know each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people nodded slightly and looked at Walter: "Long time no see, coagulation. You are still so dirty and boring."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fr. Watt, who lost his right arm, fell from the sky, bent over and picked up the sickle in the dust, and said with a smile: "If you have fun, it has nothing to do with me. I just need to feel interesting. "That's fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if you believe in abandonment? Give up your organization and raise the knife to your compatriots?" The balloon dominator asked sharply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fr. Watt was a bit sloppy and murmured: "When you are killing your classmates for many years, we are no longer compatriots." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, he stood up and said: "I have guarded the bloody maze for decades, secretly helping the church to deal with countless dirty things, even when being chased." I am still helping you clean up the mess in Bain City. I have already paid off the church's kindness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really an unfamiliar white-eyed wolf." Two people sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Su Ge can’t listen, sneer: “It’s your arrogance and stupidity, and some precious people are forced into the so-called white-eyed wolf in your eyes. Now, is there still a face here to say someone else? First look at the mouth that is full of dirty and bloody, and are not qualified to say such things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After waiting for the two to finish, Su Ge looked at the flame dominator and said: "Do these two wastes also dominate? How to think and realm Are you at a level with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame dominator snorted and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Less nonsense, kill them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly came two more dominators The situation is extremely harsh for the church in the late bells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the churches of the late bell church are very powerful for ordinary mystery, they are tied together and are not opponents of a dominator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now from a size perspective, this is a must-do battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing support arrived, the three archbishops took the hemorrhagic remedy again, and then rushed to the battle to continue fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time you will die." Laurie's tone is extremely determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug's eyelids drooped slightly and said casually: "Is it? This can be said no."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
