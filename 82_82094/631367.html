			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Duke’s demands and desires, Su Ge still did not agree to rashly, saying calmly: “For our church, and the existence of my Lord, now It’s not convenient to say because the teachings of our church are completely different from the teachings of traditional religion.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Duketon is more curious and eager, tempted Asked: "So, can you briefly talk about the teachings of your church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is silent, then says: "This can, but you want Make sure that all the conversations between you and me today can't let the third person know. If you break your promise..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge’s eyes It’s full of coldness: “At that time, you were not facing me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, I felt the powerful atmosphere of Sugna. The two people who were scared trembled, and then the chicken glutinous rice nodded and said, "I swear by the reputation of our Hausmann family!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "I will not be surprised when I hear it, because our teachings are completely different from the teachings of the false deceit in March."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Su Ge briefly introduced the teachings of the Church of the Late Bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Duke and Stephen heard the doctrine of safety and cleanliness, the expression was full of shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This deviant doctrine can be said to be completely contrary to the current mainstream doctrine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is precisely because of this that Duke’s inner desire is even stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this doctrine, this liberal system makes Duke think that it is very suitable for his family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...this is really shocking." Duke said after listening to silence for a long time, murmured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stepne nodded and said: "If this doctrine is seen by the church in March, it will definitely be a heresy, but it is this kind of doctrine. It is really true." The kindness and compassion of the manifestation of the gods allows us to find the home of peace of mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Compared with the teachings of your church, the teachings of other churches are simply the dogmas of slaves and fools," Duke said shockally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugar’s sarcasm with a sneer: “The false teachings are deliberately ignorant, let people think rigidly, settle in the status quo, suppress freedom, and control the people. Thoughts. This also proves that the gods they believe in are nothing but false gods. The worship and beliefs of the poor believers are not given to God, but to those who are corrupt and corrupt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the various missionaries he met from childhood to small, Duke recognized these words by Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hausmann family is a famous family in the world. It has always been the object of competition among major religions, and the missionaries sent are even above the level of the Archbishop. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the mission is more like a copper-smelling negotiation, and the core of the middle is always the distribution of interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today’s what he heard, refreshed Duke’s perception of religion and his beliefs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge’s calmly reaching out, picking up the blood wine in front of him, and taking a small sip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a smooth, cool liquid circulates in the mouth of Su Ge, and the aroma of the heart bursts out of the mouth, even in the breath of Su Ge. All have a touch of aroma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the blood wine is swallowed, a burst of fragrance flows through the mouth, and then Su Ge feels that his mental state and consciousness have entered a very special state. It seems to be a blank, it seems to be ethereal, anyway, the whole person becomes full of vitality while maintaining a special calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood wine enters the abdomen, and the cold and comfortable feeling gradually spreads to the whole body, giving people a smooth and relaxed time to get up and stretch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is beyond the scope of the wine." After a few minutes, Su Ge looked at the glass of his hand and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not bad." Shelly's voice full of satisfaction came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge turned to look at it and found that Shirley’s bloody wine had already been drunk by her, and it seemed that it was still unfinished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, she set her sights on the glass of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled with a sly love and handed the blood wine directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley’s mouth was filled with a happy smile, and he took the cup very rudely, drinking a small mouthful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite Duke saw this heart full of shock, not shocking Su Ge's favor for his fiancee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, he has such a perfect and charming woman, he will also hold it in his hand, and he will love it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shocked by Su Ge’s resistance and self-control ability to blood wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of high blood alcohol drink a sip of wine, it will produce a desire and obsession, like a person who is thirsty in the desert, sees a glass of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he did not expect that Su Ge sent his blood wine so easily and calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it’s all said. I can handle your uncle's things, but you need to prepare some materials. It will take a few days to prepare." Su Ge’s voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke tempted and asked: "These days... should my uncle be safe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"It's very safe, rest assured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge looked at the time and said: "Time is not too early, we should go home. I have eaten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke hurriedly got up: "It’s a pity to not eat together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge smiled slightly: "There is still time in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... Mr. Black Mist, the matter of your church..." Duke asked temptedly. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge said: "I need trust in you. Now you are not worthy of my trust. I naturally will not rush into the church. Our church is absolutely pure, there is no traitor, false believer. ,亵渎者.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duke nodded quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, the two men took the sage and respectfully sent Su Ge and Shirley to the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Duke also gave four bottles of unicorn blood wine to Su Ge in a dark iron box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a small amount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the unintentional conversation between two people, the value of this bottle of blood wine is one thousand francs, and there is no market price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on the carriage back, Shirley looked at the wooden box beside him, and the eyebrows were full of happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the blood wine feeling?" Su Ge asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley nodded with satisfaction: "The taste is very good, and it does have what he said, you can drink more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke said that this wine can make kidney and impotence, and Su Ge nodded slightly, and indeed can drink more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about side effects?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl said casually: "There is no side effect to me, my body is completely different from your inferior form."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug sighed: "I know that the side effects are still my own."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The one just in you What is the cool air behind the neck?” Xue Lier asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can be called a god, it is estimated that only Xue Lier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge explained: "If nothing unexpected, it should be Mordiquian."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
