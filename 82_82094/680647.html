			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving Mary’s home, Sug took a second sandwich that he had not had time to eat, and returned home with meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the house, I heard a hearty smile and Betty’s crisp laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the living room, just to see the ancient sensation leaning on the chair, laughing haha ​​and Betty talking about something, giving Betty a giggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that today’s ancient senses seem to be a little different from the previous ones, giving Sug a feeling of incomprehensibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but let Su Ge feel, but there is nothing to feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This old boy, will you be a sister?" Su Ge had a lot of things in his heart. He didn't think much, muttered in his mouth and walked over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Sugg coming back, Betty hurriedly smiled and stood up: "Adult, I am going to prepare tea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded, sat down and ate a second sandwich, and asked: "How do you have time to come to me today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;古觉笑呵呵说说: "I feel the smell of 嫉妒."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge snorted: "I have something to say." The women around you are not as good as the hair of my fiancee."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no opinion that Su Ge exaggerated his words and said with approval: "Of course, The existence of the sage is the independence of the world. The flower of glory standing in the clouds is not comparable to those of the mud."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge sighs: "Sheryl is not the one you said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient sense still shook his head firmly and said: "I will not read the mistake, it is you who is wrong. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge does not intend to continue to argue with him here, and asks: "Now the city is very messy, what are the plans for this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gu Jue sighed: "I am leaving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where? Where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Go home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two words are very concise, but Su Ge seems to have a special meaning in the tone of the ancient sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go home? Don't tell me your home is in the abyss." Su Ge said half-jokingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gujue shook his head: "My family is on the other side of the abyss. If you want to go back, you must go through the abyss."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha!?" I heard this Su Ge a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the abyss? There should be no such world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world is a regular dodecahedron, which is still a ball in theory. In this case, no matter where you can reach through the surface, there is no need to go through the ghost place of the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a deep god in the eyes of the ancient saying: "I can see it, you know a lot about the truth of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge has some vigilance. At this time, the insights revealed by Gu Jue made him feel vigilant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have noticed Su Ge’s vigilance and said with a smile: “Don’t worry, I have no hostility to you.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gujue laughed and said a word, let Su Ge tremble suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you and I are the same. You and I are descendants of Pangu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;! ! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, Su Ge’s body is stiff, his eyes are wide, and he’s incredulously looking at the ancient senses, as if he heard the most incredible words in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gu Ju did not continue to say, smiled and looked out the window, calm and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg feels confused at this moment, he came to the world for two years, and the accumulated memory before, at this moment was completely disrupted . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly discovered that the truth in this world is far beyond his imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes passed, Sug reluctantly smoothed down his thoughts and asked a little hoarse voice: "How are you sure?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sense of violation." Gu Ju said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gu Jue continues to say: "You have something similar to me in your body, that is, to distort yourself into a strange world. You try to adapt The tone of the world's speech, try to adapt to the customs here. However, inadvertently, you will still say something that does not conform to this era, and some idioms that are not commonly used here."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge opened his mouth and then sighed: "So obvious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not obvious, people in this world pay attention Not enough, but I have a deep understanding of it, I noticed it when I met you." Guju smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge’s heart was full of complex sighs, and then he tempted to ask: “The Pangu giant... is it still alive?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's already dead." Guyu said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sighed: "Sure enough, this is the case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gujue looking at Su Ge Looks like, "I don't know if I have the memory of my previous hometown. But it doesn't matter, just need to determine your roots, I will be very reassured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Anyone has a bad person," said Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guju laughed: "Of course, my hometown bastard still has a lot. But I know that you are a good person."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The beginning of man..." Gujue said three words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge almost instinctively responded: "Sex is good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silence for two seconds, two people At the same time, I laughed and looked very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After each other, Su Ge asked: "Where is your hometown? The whole world is a sphere. Why do you have to cross the abyss to reach?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this ancient feeling, Su Ge did not hide too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gujue first answered Su Ge’s first question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The skull of the ancient god, you should have heard it." Gu Ju said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "I heard it is a very mysterious place. The world is rumored to be isolated from the world. People there claim to be descendants of the ancient gods. Everyone is very powerful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient sense said: "The skull of the ancient god is where my hometown is."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The skull of the ancient god is? It seems that it is not too mysterious, even there are many people who will appear frequently and walk around the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the original information of Bart, when the Maze guard was tracked in Bain City, the skull of the ancient god also came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guju smiled: "That is just the edge. You know the skull of the ancient god, why should you teach this name?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug shakes his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is because the place we live in is a huge skull." Gu Jue said a secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The huge skull? The skull that holds a world? Where is the world..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halfway through the words, Su Ge suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guju smiled: "It seems that you are still clear about the legend of Pangu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you say..." Su Ge heard this and felt the spirit in Trembling, the entire world view has been subverted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gujue gives a positive nod: "The skull of the ancient god is the skull of the Pangu giant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Su Ge blinked and didn't know what to say for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gujue turned a topic: "Okay, now is not the time, so you are not suitable for knowing too much. I know that you are at this moment." Shocked and unbelievable. But I have not had much time left, so let's make a long story short."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge hears the tone of the ancient sense of urgency, nod : "Please say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First of all, the skull of the ancient god is located in the inner world, that is, the inner world. Its passage connecting the world is the abyss. There is a piece of pure land, a pure land that has not been polluted by the March goddess, and it is also the last hope of the world's redemption."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded hard, remember Come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gujue looked at Su Ge’s gloves and continued: “You carry too many things on the body, so much that I can’t understand. But from you I can guess something in the Holy Grail. I can't help you in the next road because I have been eyeing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is it? Su Ge whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient face is dignified and said: "An immortal who has lived for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The Holy See?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient sense nodded: "This time it is not my body, but the phantom demon. The reason for coming over is mainly to tell you Some secrets about the abyss, and the way you travel through the abyss to reach the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Sugton found the reason why he felt very weird. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please!" Su Ge did not delay the time, succinctly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First of all, the abyss is alive. He is known in our literature as the dragon that opens up the world and engulfs the world."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Opening the world and engulfing the world's dragon?" Su Ge brows slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gujue continues to say: "Don’t entangle the name. According to the legend, He is a true God. After the death of the Pangu Giants, the dissipated soul combines with some things and condenses again. The god of the day. It can be understood as the son and avatar of the Pangu giant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge feels the stimuli he is getting today is sharper than when he was crossing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gujue continues: "The abyss has buried too many human filths, which has polluted the abyss. That is hidden in the nightmare, Byron City has already It has been found by the great god of the eye, so you have to be careful. It is very likely that the great god of the eye will get the knowledge left by Byron the Great in Byron, thus touching the human dream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge instantly thought of those inhuman terrorist hunters, frowning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, what you need to pay attention to is that the abyss has three ports. One link side, one link inside. There is also a link star. It is not only the Yi people but also the foreign gods who enter the world. The position of the Wolf Blood Legion is very important, you must take good care of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge seriously nodded, indicating understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the body of Gujue has begun to become distorted, emitting a burst of black mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, the old immortal began to attack me." Gu Jue's face suddenly became very ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge hurriedly asked: "The way to enter the world!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Going to the abyss of devour........."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
