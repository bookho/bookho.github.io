			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly and said, "It’s very good, but now there is nothing in the world worth hunting and conquering."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuck listened to the knock on the chest, and stepped back without talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing this, Su Ge looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the storm is a completely distorted gray world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is very weird, up and down, left and right, six directions, five of which are covered by the gray twisted world, only the dark abyss below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This warship is sailing on this abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those occasional souls emerge from the abyss and disappear after passing the big clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg looks to this gray world, and now you can see the gray world around it is very distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be composed of countless gray bubbles, which are constantly twisting, expanding, shrinking, and even not knowing for what reason In various forms, Su Ge can even see some large gray tentacles extending from some places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These tentacles swing in all directions, and the instinct continues to extend into the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Su Ge is very disgusting with these tentacles, his body gives him the knowledge to tell him that these tentacles are not disgusting things, but human dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision of the gods is very clear, the bubbles in the gray world, each bubble is a dream of a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dreams of countless people gather here to form a world like the world of dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world of dreams...the master of dreams...the master...I seem to be able to control the world." Su Ge looked at the world of dreams, instinctively Shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly the gray tentacles that extended out were like the traction of the unknown forces, and suddenly they extended toward the battleship. The eager look was like seeing the mother's child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, I can control these dreams." Su Ge thought suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the upcoming contact with these dreams, Su Ge’s big hand waved, and the invisible power isolated these dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not ready to enter other people’s dreams yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dreams are always incomparably messy and distorted. These twists into tentacles that want to link the abyss will definitely be more frantic, and rash contact is not wise. And wait and see for a while to make a decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge is very cautious, familiar with the myth of Cthulhu, very jealous of things in the dream. After all, Cthulhu itself is the sleeping god who controls the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The degree of control of dreams is mostly subjective, and the actual effect needs to be tested. This is not an urgent matter, anyway, there is time, first look through the present This complete body can not find other things on this battleship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge thought of this and turned into the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a complete body of God, sitting back on the throne, looking down, Su Ge really found something new and different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, overlooking the twenty-four statues on either side of the stairs, above them, Sug saw something illusory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a unique badge. A badge is floating above each statue to connect with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another section of this badge directly relates to the body of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge can clearly sense these badges and control these badges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s big hand, these twenty-four badges were summoned by the invisible force and flew to the front of Su Ge, neatly arranged into one piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The badges are divided into three types depending on the type of statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the silver-gray ghost wolf badge, a total of twelve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the ice blue skull badge, a total of eight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third three, but each badge is completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above are engraved with: flame, sickle, scepter, giant sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's about the same as the outside. My strength and vision are not enough before the body is complete. I can't see these things even if they exist there. Now the body is complete. Not only can you see, but even know the relationship or even the name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said that the knowledge resolved in his eyes quickly appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The storm hunting, once a forgotten king gave him the imprint of the most powerful and loyal servant. With these imprints can be connected to each other Not only can the physical quality of the journalist be reinstated, but the servant can also rely on the power of the king. When the servant who receives the imprint dies, the imprint will automatically detach and return to the throne before waiting for its next master. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After analyzing the information, Su Ge looked at these marks and continued to analyze the intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The storm hunting is divided into three levels. The lowest level is the fog fog hunting. Up to twelve can be distributed. The fog fog hunting will change the host. Physical state, stimulating potential, giving the host the ability to atomize. You can listen to the owner's voice through hunting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second level is called Frost Cold Conquest Hunting Print. Up to eight can be issued. Frost and Cold Conquest prints the ability to lose atomization on the basis of fog hunting, but you can choose a frost weapon and be qualified to choose your own mount from the wolves. India actively reports to the owner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third level is called Apocalypse Storm Hunting. There are only four. The Apocalypse Storm Hunting allows the host to inherit the owner. One aspect of endless power, and become the embodiment of this aspect, to reach the ultimate in one field. The owner of the Apocalypse Storm Hunting is the apostle of the king, who can take the initiative to return to the battleship and see him."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
