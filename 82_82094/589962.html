			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three-story cabin, room 3440. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moss was lying on the bed, his body was constantly struggling, his face was twisted, as if he had a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huh! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly he sat up suddenly and saw that his body was gradually twisting, and even some strange green scales appeared on his skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s eyes turned black in a moment, and a strange symbol like a shofar appeared on his forehead, then he turned and fell from the bed to the ground, rushing to the side Grab a lot of weird yellow sand and put it in your mouth. The whole body kneels on the ground and begins to pray quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With constant prayer, the invisible tattoo on his body squirmed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a very large presence, a little activity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see the green scales on his body quickly fade away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten seconds, he was unable to lie on the carpet, his face was pale and low: "Csuluru! You are really deceiving too much!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hours ago, he calmed down after meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the failure of the previous few days has caused him to lose half of his arm, he still has confidence in his skills, and he has gradually mastered the information about the rescue. And reported to his organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn’t dreamed for a long time, even if he was attacked by that horrible presence, he didn’t have a nightmare because he believed that the great shepherd’s god was sheltering Be yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he saw a sea in a dream, he felt something was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that he was attacked by a dreamer, or a more terrifying nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a mysterious man who fought a battle, he quickly responded by using the special methods of their organization to wake him up through the power of great gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the horror of this dream is far beyond his imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just before he had time to pray, there was a huge octopus that was terrible from the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark tentacles of the octopus directly entangled his body, and there was no effect on how he broke free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, he felt that he was gradually pulled into the sea by the octopus. The place where the octopus was entangled quickly grew strange green scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, Moss felt his inspiration directly blown up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that he is not far from death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as his body is covered by such scales, or is completely dragged into the sea, he is no longer himself, but becomes so horrible Monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, he knows where this attack comes from and how it resolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because all the people who join their organization must understand the most difficult rivals in their organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he used the secrets that the organization gave them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in his own dreams, so he uses his own psionic and subconscious minds and begins to quickly transform his dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, just as he was about to enter the sea, he created a ship that was not too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the ship slammed into the head of the octopus, and the octopus was hit hard and gradually returned to the sea, and he woke up from the dream. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a deep breath, Moss quickly calmed down, first on the ground, praying and grateful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the great god of the shepherd saved him again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great yellow seal has always sheltered himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chululu, do you really think that our brothers of the Yellow Emperor will be afraid of you? Originally intended to be low-key, since you are looking for death, then don't blame me. You are welcome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moss's face is extremely embarrassing and gloomy, and his heart has made up his mind, and must give a lesson to this horrible enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moss is affiliated with the Brotherhood of the King of the Yellow Emperor, whose ancestors were the third dynasty, the great aristocrat of the Calding dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the demise of the dynasty, the great aristocrats changed their names to become ordinary people in order to avoid the pursuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they did not intend to continue to be mediocre, although the kingdom is gone, but their faith is still there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great king of yellow clothes, the master of the sand, the god of the shepherd has always existed in their hearts, and has become a beacon to guide them to continue living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moss joined the Brotherhood of the Yellow King from the age of fifteen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the Brotherhood was still in the dark development stage. He went to school and accepted the education of the Brotherhood. Later he entered the college league and became a world in the world. Deacon who ran on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the time is ripe, they don’t need to continue to be patient, they want to win their country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their country has risen secretly among the four colleges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, like fate, they once again met their dead rivals: Cthulhu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roots of this unknown organization are no longer inspectable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Moss, this weird organization gave birth to a lot of crazy cult organizations, and according to history, in the early days of the establishment of the Third Dynasty, Cthulhu The Order and the King of the Yellow Emperor were hostile to each other and a large number of large-scale battles took place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They seem to be born enemies, combined with the long-term accumulation of hatred, so that after they meet each other, the results are almost never endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the peak of the Third Dynasty, they carried out a crazy slaughter of the Cthulhu Order, but still did not let the Order completely extinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the destruction of the Third Dynasty, this organization found the Brotherhood of the King of the Yellow Emperor like a skeleton, and the battle between them has continued until now. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that the two organizations are deadly enemies for thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When performing the task, Moss got some news from the Cthulhu Order and knew they were ready for the coming ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, investigating the actions of the Cthulhu Order has become the instinct of the Brotherhood of the King of Yellow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Moss’s focus is not here, because he has more important things to do, and he is relatively restrained throughout the journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that this restraint could be understood by the opposite side, after all, there are other purposes on the opposite side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he did not expect that his restraint was actually understood by the other party as weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really think that the master's secret profession can only cover the sky? Want to kill me before the ceremony? Very good, I will let you I know that I am irritated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moss is indifferent and cruel in both eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His task has been basically completed, just need to know the career of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that Su Ge has been launched, it is a matter of time to expose the profession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can now turn more attention to his enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Compared with the great god of the Yellow Emperor, my life is not worth mentioning, the Cthulhu Order, I will let you know, The horror of the great king of yellow clothes and the gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
