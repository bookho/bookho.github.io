			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the battle is still in the mountains, the camp on the ground is also fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, you can see why there are more than a dozen giant ghouls around the church territory in March. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant ghouls are each elephant-sized, and the sharp claws are half a meter long, like a steel knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;狰狞The teeth are each one inch long and can easily bite a horse in half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body of the heavy resistant carapace has a strong mysterious resistance and physical resistance, comparable to a tank car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the rampage of these ghouls, the entire camp was a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a mess does not mean that the church has been defeated in March. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden smooth battle that just happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I don’t know why, a master clerk suddenly appeared in the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This priest is silent and ugly, but his fighting power is terrifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His occupation is a butcher, belonging to the Nighthawk Church ruling, he has no name, others call him a butcher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One-handed sawtooth chopper can easily tear the body of a giant ghoul, and the other hand carries a sturdy metal glove full of blood, which is owned by a huge human palm. The destructive power and attack power of terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of this action, the bishop of the cold-stricken church, Sheridan, seems to have known the existence of the butcher, and he easily killed five giant foods. The ghoul didn't care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roll." The butcher's thin body stood there, his mouth full of yellow teeth, and a low, hoarse voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheridan stared at him faintly and said: "I know you, butcher. I know your knowledge, my ghoul does take you no way." Your defense power, your attack power can indeed be called the strongest of all the masters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I know your weaknesses very well," Sheridan said, putting his hands in front of him and whispering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Looking for death!" The butcher took a jagged chopper and stepped forward. He walked slowly, but no one could stop in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that he doesn’t want to go fast, but that his knowledge is like this, he’s not going fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chopper passed by, and the giant ghoul that rushed over instantly fell to the ground and was dismembered in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step on the internal organs and blood to move on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side, a large number of people who are cold-hearted churches attack other people in a domineering manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes people feel weird is that they are not attacking the people of the Nighthawk Church, but Jenny who is healing the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there are still some other mysterious people who have suddenly inserted a hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was just a mysterious person who suddenly threw in a dozen grenade and bombed Jenny into a serious injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, she is a master priest, simple treatment, not fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This consumes a lot of her psionic power, and the battle is very difficult at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, their goal is not the Frost Witch? How have you been attacking me?" Jenny was very gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny’s state is very bad at this time, the whole body is blood, the robes are attached to the body, the shoulders, the abdomen, and the legs have many wounds, not even Less shrapnel is too late to be taken out of the flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forehead is full of sweat, and the messy hair is very embarrassing on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Psionic Shield blocked several attacks, and she looked around and immediately found some problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She found that the church members she had left belonged to the Department of Horace, and her subordinates had followed Horace up the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, these people are fighting casually, not only do not have the full force, but even faintly take the initiative to stay away from her priest who should have stood at the end, expose her . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Horace!" At this time, Jenny was filled with anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, she has figured out some clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holas, wants her to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh oh! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle was tough, and there was a sudden burst of cheers from far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny turned his head and looked pale, his face suddenly sinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, I didn’t know where the ice came, and I formed a huge ice block, and I actually frozen the butcher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pillars of the butcher are lost, the masters are the cold-binding, and Sheridan is the overlord on this battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celde looks very afraid of death, seeing the situation is not good, immediately gathered the few remaining clergyman: "Retreat!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, the group of people hugged into a group, actually ... ran, the big camp was given to the cold church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheridan sneered and did not pursue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came here for two purposes, one is to take away the Frost Witch, the other is to honor the promise, kill the female priest, as he gets enough information The price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take this woman out, you can roll." Sheridan said a faint voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The healing of the surrounding church seems to have already had a tacit understanding. Actually, the words are turned around and run, leaving only one person Jenny alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny stood up in a difficult way and asked indifferently: "Is Horace telling you the card of the Nighthawk Church? The butcher's knowledge is intensified, but the weakness is that the spiritual space and physical activity are not enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "By reducing the activity, you can tell that the butcher who is not bad is frozen directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheridan laughs : "Nature, and you are the reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, the cleansing body that is nourished by the light of the goddess, the master priest, the well-trained body, full of Fresh and elastic, your taste will be very good." Sheridan finished, raised his hand, a cold ice gun condensed, shot to Jenny's chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it really going to die?" Jenny was very reluctant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the attack, Alger quickly returned, leaving the people of the Church of the Holy Blood directly, not knowing where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, she really didn't have any backhands and helpers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this critical moment, a shadow flashed past, and Jenny suddenly felt that she was wrapped in a gentle force and then moved quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slowly raised her head and saw a handsome face under the mask, feeling the elegance and maturity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Archbishop!?" she asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mature gentleman bowed his head and smiled: "It is heartbreaking to let such a beautiful woman suffer such a wound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Jenny’s face is reddish: “The Archbishop can really speak.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall reaches out Touching her face, the tone is full of magneticity: "I can say it is true!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! Jenny suddenly beats the heart uncontrollably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old gentleman who hasn’t known how many years has passed has been very successful in recruiting women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, now is not the time to take the girl!" Hills, who also took the mask of the church in the evening, walked over and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall coughed and put down Jenny and said, "Hills, you have matured a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cold Church? When is it so annoying!" A knight with a big sword and the same mask came over, it was the news from Hills, just wandering here today. The second female knight, Vegniya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a change of head, Alger with a mask came with five tall werewolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nine people are now very arrogantly lined up, standing on a slightly higher stone, looking down at the cold-hearted church in the camp, full of A powerful gas field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you?" Sheridan saw the sudden appearance of these people, and asked with a brow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, several werewolves retreat slightly, and Jeros with a wolf head mask walked over, and it sounded from a special magnetic hoarse voice: "The evening clock Church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The evening church?" Sheridan thought in his heart and had never heard of this organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss continues: "Frost is ours, you can roll."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your people? Jokes!" Sheridan sneered, and an ice gun shot like a bullet to Gerlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus raised his hand and grasped the ice cone with a bare hand when the ice gun was less than five centimeters away from his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheridan saw this moment of binocular tightening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are in a hurry, if we don't plan to go, then die." Gerlos said, throwing away the ice cone and pulling out the white frost sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a person rushed over and whispered in Sheridan’s ear to say a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheridan listened to some irritability in his heart, looked up at Gerlos and Randall, whose atmosphere was completely unknown, and bit his teeth: "The church in the late hours, we are cold and the church remembers you!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, take people and leave quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they have a number of advantages, his inspiration tells him that if they dare to fight these few people, they will die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the two people, he could not see through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unseen means the unknown, the unknown represents the horror! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the most important thing is that he did not expect that the Nighthawk Church used that kind of strong cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their current strength, they can’t open at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The damn Horace, actually put me here!" Sheridan was full of anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound waves hiding behind say: "It’s gone, there are no people left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Jerlos nodded: "Alger, with the werewolf to guard, do not show their true identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Gerlos took Randall, Sonic and others quickly into the camp and found the frost in the cave below the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frost! Frost! Are you okay?" Sonic waved and saw the sisters who were tied into the cage in the cage hurriedly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frosty mouth was blocked and could not speak, but the heart was full of shock and happiness, nodded hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills pushed forward with a force, and some helplessly said: "As the adults said, this cage can not be destroyed by conventional means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall touched his chin and said, "I can go in, but people can't bring it out. Can you take the cage directly?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
