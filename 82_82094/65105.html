			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Suge is awake, this body will fall asleep on the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, Su Ge couldn’t know what was going on here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now it’s different, after having fourteen warriors, they will be here forever, and record everything that happened here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As just as Chuck said, they heard the believers’ prayers for Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge nodded with satisfaction and turned to look at the long gun in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lances are still silver-gray, with fine lines on them, which is no different from what they were before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the inner, Su Ge clearly feels that he has a tighter relationship with this spear, and he has a deeper grasp of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I don’t know what this pike is, but now it seems to be very powerful as my weapon, and it is the only one that can be used by me. Bringing into the real world. It can easily cross reality and dreams, and even let me cross the world, it is not a product."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palm slowly squeezes the rifle The gun body gradually emits a blue mist, and there are countless storms and lightning flashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retracting the line of sight, Su Ge quickly dealt with what happened today through this sacred body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way you talk, the details of your actions, and the knowledge you've seen are quickly digested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the deep learning of the legendary dream? After deep learning, people will remember for a long time and can't forget." Su Ge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daytime message is sorted out, and Su Ge’s only invisible is the green flame in Bart’s hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think that the flame is what I can understand now. I know that too much will only die faster." Su Ge thought about standing up and walking out of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ice Warship is still driving in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge faintly asked: "Do you see anything else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuck Shaking his head: "Returning to my master, except that the souls can't see anything else after entering the fog through the fog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not speak, standing on the battleship Look at the fog around the edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has an urge at this time to jump from this battleship and see what is outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this impulse was suppressed by Su Ge, and he does not have this courage now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this fog can be spread out," Su Ge held his rifle and whispered to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, and Sog’s stunned fog saw the violent boiling around the battleship, as if it were being boiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the instant, the weapons in the hands of the fourteen soldiers suddenly pointed forward, and the whole body tightened to protect Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, retreat." Su Ge said indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the soldiers listened to the moment, they stepped back and retracted their rifles and chests, just like the guards of the military parade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside, those fogs suddenly huddled and gathered after boiling to a certain extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray fog gradually turned into a solitary blue aura, which turned into five large tornadoes that fell into the armor of Su Ge and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After these fogs returned, the sturdy body of Su Ge was suddenly illusory, and the whole person was surrounded by the aura of blue, only to see A long gun in the hand, a fuzzy ghost mask, and a pair of eyes burning with an ice blue flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Su Ge feels that he suddenly grasps a huge force. This power is unclear, as if he can grasp all the existence here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of the movement, his body flew lightly, off the deck of the battleship, and came to the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the flow of new power, Su Ge feels perfect, and an indescribable sense of fullness emerges in the depths of his soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turned out that these fogs are not a surrounding scene, but part of myself, and contain a lot of power, which has been wrapped around the battleship." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked down at his body and analyzed himself through the vision of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the current situation, it can be judged that this body is indeed the body of God, but the form that was originally summoned is not complete, so it can be used by Hills. The two are looking directly. These fogs are an important part of the body. Now, after the return of the fog, this is a complete body of gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simplify handling In the physical situation, Su Ge looked at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog around it completely dissipated, and Su Ge had seen the full look of the warship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a huge battleship with a length of 100 meters. It is covered with ice. Although it is broken, it is very magnificent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment it floats in the air and is slowly advancing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power to let the warship advance is not the vain energy, but the inexhaustible ghost wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of these ghost wolves is huge and numerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are each at least three meters high and five meters long. The whole body consists of a translucent ghost light that forms a transparent body, sparkling with a icy, cold blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they are ghosts, they are covered in silver-gray armor and have a strong body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, these ghost wolves are at the forefront of the entire battleship and continue to advance the battleship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the middle of this group of ghost wolves is a wolf king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wolf king is extremely large, it looks at least ten meters high and fifteen meters long. It is different from other wolves. He has real hair, dark back, white and white limbs, black and white, with towering ears and a pair of burning eyes, full of martial arts and majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a long hair, and each hair is like a wind, floating lightly in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough!" At the moment of seeing this "Wolf King", Su Ge felt a bit tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this guy is simply a magnified version + a high version of the second ha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My Lord, remove the fog of the valley, are you ready to go out?" Chuck and others were excited and excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exit?" Su Ge listened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuck squeezed the weapon and said, "Well, you gave me the qualification to wait for the servant to become a warrior. We put it on the armor and gave it a huge Strength and new savvy knowledge, and know your habits and orders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啥?啥啥?啥Command!?" Hey, he looked awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sight looked at everyone, Su Ge’s eyes faintly said: "Oh? Since you mentioned it, then talk about everything you have been perfused, don't Let me down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuck excitedly nodded and said, "Yes! My lord. But please understand, because we are only the lowest level fighters, I don’t know much.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it’s no problem, as your master, my capacity is tolerant of all of you." Su Ge said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone listened, they were excited and screamed on the floor: "Thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
