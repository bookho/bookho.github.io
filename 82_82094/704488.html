			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Emilia, Su Ge did not feel the accident, because he has now generally thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After three nights, people will usher in a true new life, the world will usher in a change, and the glory will flash in the sky with thunder, hope is like a wind As the world comes down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looks at the words on paper, this sentence is the core of this big paragraph. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this sentence heralds hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s fingers knocked on this sentence a few times, and whispered the following words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you wish,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he thinks, < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all things are returned, one is also everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Normalized..." Su Ge understands the meaning of this sentence with awkward human thinking and even dull human thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia’s arm is placed on the table, palm rest on the chin, and Su Ge, who seems to be a lot older, has gradually become a golden vertical His eyes are filled with the incomprehensible eyes of ordinary people: "You are so clean now, it is really enviable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug returned to God and smiled and said: "All things are so deserved, the price is relative. I have now abandoned all mysterious possibilities, in exchange for this ideal state away from mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, Su Ge suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emeria's body leans forward slightly: "What did you think of?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge I went back to God and said, "I suddenly remembered the Elf Order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elves' mission?" Emilia is somewhat puzzled. What does Su Ge have to do with the Elves? It is clear that the "sacred mark of the lake" has been repaid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly said: "After the Lake of the Elves, it is the desert of the stars. The desert is home to the ideal town far from the world: Safiro. Known as the ideal township away from human disputes, its nature is very similar to what I am now. After I suddenly thought of it, I was thinking about what the world had repaid? Or, what did they abandon?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emilia listened to silence, although her mysterious knowledge has reached an unmeasurable level, but she still can not understand the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a moment of contemplation, Su Ge returned to Shinto: "Forget it, this matter will be known later."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing his eyes on Emilia, he carefully looked at Emilia's skin whiter, while the body surrounded a strong sense of strangeness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is your current status?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emeria looked down at the palm with her fine white scales and said, "Good, very powerful. I even feel free to be in the air." Soaring, you can break the mountains with a wave of your hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After all, it's a dragon!" Sug smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emeria seems to be unhappy with the current situation, with a deep-eyed saying: "Know why I can become the current level?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where do I know." Su Ge said casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of you." Emilia said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge licked his eyes and was a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Three nights ago, you repelled the king of yellow clothes," Emilia said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and admitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The structure of the king of yellow clothes after the serious injury collapsed, and the mela as a container recovered consciousness for a short time." Emilia said The face is heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge had some accidents, and he was completely unclear about these situations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After that, she repaid my kindness to her, and inspired the dragon blood that has been in my hidden state with the power of the gods. Not only did it turn me into The real dragon, I also know a lot from the blood of the knowledge that our dragons have inherited in countless years. Through this knowledge, I have read these gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suge silences: "What does she want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In mystery, repayment is a good act, but this behavior is often Both the purpose and the behavior are completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of reimbursement is to cut off causality, and those who want to cut off cause and effect are often accompanied by infinite loneliness and tragedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She wants to cut off all the causes and effects of this world, completely seal the king of yellow clothes on the border of old dreams." Speaking of this, Emilia's face is exposed A trace of pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug squeezed his fist and then lowered it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not have the ability to save the poor man now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The so-called spiritual world, it is the boundary of the old dreams of the past." Su Ge sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before in Myra’s clinic, he heard that Father Sini called the world a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Su Ge felt faintly wrong, but then there was too much to think about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After careful consideration, Su Ge also faintly discovered some problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, he always feels that there are three behemoths on his head in the world of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time he even felt that seven lines of sight across the space were staring at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling is not in the real world and fantasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emeria said: "The old dreams of the past are the weird worlds of the gods and thoughts that have passed away in the past. Because of this, there are also all the Yi and the gods. The best buffer zone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge recalled the situation there, and ironically said: "It is indeed the best buffer zone. It is really perfect to imprison the ancient gods and the Yi and the gods outside the prison." The idea is really perfect."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amilya flashed a glimmer of light in his eyes, not much to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden silence in the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, Emilia asked: "Is there anything going on here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge thought of his purpose, and said: "This time I will come to see you, because the Holy Blood Church is about to undergo a huge change, I don't want to see you in this change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emeria binoculars will take a new look at Su Ge and whispered: "You should be clear about what the consequences of doing this are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, but I am not the kind of person who can't end the war, and everything is always, I have already decided when I first entered this glory city." Slow, articulate, giving an unspeakable leisure and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emilia brows slightly wrinkled, seems to have to study the content of Su Ge’s words one word at a time, and immediately said: "However, that's it, You still have no chance of winning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not, our purpose is not to destroy the Church of the Holy Blood." Su Ge explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My trial is just the beginning. It is not those of us who are really able to judge them, but those "people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia looked at Su Ge calmly: "I know you are asking me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few seconds of pause, she stood up and turned to look at the sunny window: "I should go out and go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her previous obsession has been in the church She seems to be trying to reintegrate the church and form a new church by her own methods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that Su Ge wants to start with the Church of the Holy Blood, naturally ask her what she means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, Emilia's help to Su Ge is indeed huge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Gehe smiled, followed up, hands behind him, slowly said: "There is really a lot of fun outside, by the way, take me to the storm emperor Say hello."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emilia nodded after listening and said: "Don't think that I gave up my dreams before, I just want to rebuild my ideals in the ruins. Church. If you don't leave me with the ruins, then I will chase you to the ends of the earth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiles bigger, turns and walks Go to the door: "Reassured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, the figure slowly disappeared into Emilia's field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the daytime, Su Ge still seems to be aimlessly strolling through the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At seven o'clock in the evening, the dusty and tired Su Ge returned home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can feel the tension between Bernice and Betty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adults, the clerics around are increasing geometrically, the news from Cass, the Hausmann family is also completely surrounded by a large number of clergy "Bennis said incomparably dignified." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge changed his clothes and nodded slightly: "After knowing my true identity, I can naturally find them along my previous communication." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should we do? They seem to be ready to do it." Bernice asked temptedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took off his shirt and revealed some thin upper body: "They are blocking the nearby neighborhood, and they won’t do it before the blockade is completed. We should still have Two hours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard... there are some big people that we don't even know, and even the mystery at the dominator level." Bernice's temptation to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and touched her head: "Reassured, this battle is an alarm for the world to awaken, but also to those who are filthy The things are sent to the funeral of the earth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Bernice’s inexplicable peace of mind came first. After all, the great monk was never miscalculated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will take a shower first and prepare my clothes." Sug said, walking into the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis nodded and turned to walk upstairs to Su Ge’s bedroom. Just opened the bedroom door and saw that the black robe was a bit lonely. The folded clothes on the bed seemed like a puppy that was left out by the owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robes that can be moved need 8 points to see, and now the soul is regarded as zero, and the black robes are no longer visible in front of them. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lost contact with the owner, making the black robe very lonely, and even a little confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis looked at this lonely black robe, wondering why he cried silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While crying and walking to the bed, she saw that the black robe had prepared the clothes that Su Ge needed, and finally it was gently on the hand of Bernice. After two squirming, he folded into a sleeveless trench coat of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; looks like saying: Tell the owner, I am always by his side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things are spiritual, even if the master can't see himself, can't feel himself, for the black robe, it is already very good to be with the owner. Happy things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a silent beggar at the bedside, and Bernice whispered with tears in her eyes...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After an hour, Su Ge came out of the bathroom. Before the messy hair, the unmanned beard had been taken care of for a few days. It seems that Su Ge has become the master of the previous, powerful and reliable master. Level mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict walked silently and said, "Adult, clothes are ready."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge nodded slightly, but found that Bernice's eyes were reddish: "What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict whispered the scene he had just seen in the bedroom Say it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge smiled and smiled, but this smile had a feeling of incomprehension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be awkward, it seems a pity, and it seems to be happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the bedroom to take off the bathrobe, Su Ge looked at the bed without any unusual clothes, slowly put on a white shirt, fasten the button, then put on black straight Pants, dark and shiny leather shoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie your shoelaces, put on the coat of arms with the evening bell, and finally wear the sleeveless trench coat that turned into a black robe, and stretch your hand slowly. Gently touching on the clothes, Su Ge’s face is full of nostalgia and happy saying: “Thank you... thank you for your company, little guy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not Knowing the reaction of the black robe, I don't know if it is heard, he can't feel anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, put a black leather glove on his right hand, pick up his cane in his left hand, and wear a high dome hat with a special sign on the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everything is ready, Su Ge looks at the three rounds of the moon in the night sky along the bedroom window, with a calm tone, but with an indescribable arrogance: It’s been there for so many years, and it’s time to fall.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight, the night of the glory city is extra quiet, especially in the southeastern city, bar nightclubs It has been closed, and even the lights of every household have not been opened, as if it has become a ghost town with no residents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gas light of the street has also lost its light, and the big city is dark, the only light is the moonlight pouring down from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are also a few household lights on. Such as Su Ge's home, such as Hausmann Manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two light sources are like the bloody smell of the beast, and the huge church in the dark has begun to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tokachi Gate is not too far from here, the residence of the Duke of Grasse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory Admiral did not have any drowsiness, but was fully armed, and there seemed to be any fighting waiting for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
