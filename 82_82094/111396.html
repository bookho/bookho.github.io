			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard this seemingly random unintentional discourse, Gerlos suddenly caught the point that made him feel uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Warren, go find Orson and make sure the position of the circus and magician." Gerlos said immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warren listened and nodded and said: "Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerce stood up here Putting on his own hunting demon uniform, he looked at Su Ge with a deep look and said: "Your thinking is much more agile than I thought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Suddenly, Su Ge took a jump and didn't know how to answer it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still good that Gerlos didn’t plan to go deeper and asked the topic: “Is there any other arrangements in a few days?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and asked: "Is there any work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is asking your tenant." Gerlos I said while I put my equipment on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ada?" Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus nodded slightly: "I don't know what she is thinking, idle and nothing to do with the humanitarian organization." It is relatively large, and the public is more responsive to this matter. Mayor Arno has agreed to her request to accept the tramp and give them a new identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge laughed and said: "This is not very good, not all tramps are lazy people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss looked at Su Ge A smile on the face said faintly: "For you, it is the expression of inner good thoughts, but for us it is boring and cumbersome work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"What is the relationship with you?" Su Ge stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss finally hung the sword behind his back and said something full of complaints in that calm and scary tone: "Do you really use the government church as a decoration?" There is a lot of danger in accepting those unidentified tramps. To minimize this danger, the church and the government also require us to conduct a rigorous inspection of every registered tramp. Ensuring mental problems, second ensuring beliefs, and third, ensuring that there are other mysteries. This kind of thing is super troublesome and boring, it is a waste of time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of Su Ge’s listeners were not able to return to God. The idea of ​​hope in the morning was not directly thought of being shattered here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Gerlos personally check? Also check the mind, faith and mystery? My day!" Su Ge felt very desperate in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Hills and Bernice are completely different, even if two people are likely to be covered by the storm, the original witch’s breath, but if It was Jeros personally checking, even if he gave Sug 10,000 courage, Su Ge did not dare to send the two witches to the master to check. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You seem to be upset?" Gerlos asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge converged on his emotions and scratched his head and said, "I feel that I will be gloomy after three days."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus patted him on the shoulder and said: "Those things are left behind. Go, go to the circus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Okay!" Sudden came to be interested when he heard that he had to deal with the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the office, Warren has already come with Ossen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Need police support?" Orson asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss thought and said, "Yes, to prevent accidents, try to separate the entire circus from the general public."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ossen listened and nodded: "Okay, I will arrange it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, turn around and arrange the manpower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos said: "Let's go through it first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looks at Gerlos The costume of that body, the heart secretly said: "Are you going to investigate the case? Is it so scary to wear the wind?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was quickly relieved, and this is the same as the police on TV, who have been driving sirens to arrest criminals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people just walked to the door of the police station, the door was suddenly opened, an obese, middle-aged man with a split head ran into the pale face: "Dead! Dead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aoson, who was just about to leave, said: "Mr. Morgan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus asked: "Do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is the owner of the circus, who came here four days ago to register and file." Orson said directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The northern suburb of Bain City has a poor performance farm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the benefits are not good, the scale is shrinking, so a lot of venues are vacant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here, gave the second spring of this farm. Because I don't know when it started, it became a good place for the mobile circus to station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside circus will choose this place to be temporarily stationed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sain Circus was stationed here four days ago with government approval. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four-day busy performance and numerous audiences made the entire circus people feel very full of joy and happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, today, everyone heard the bad news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The circus's Jacks magician was killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room on the second floor near the northwest corner is the room of Jakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the entire second floor was emptied, and other staff members were gathered on the first floor, and his face was pale and worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood at the door and looked inside, and the stomach began to churn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Jacks magician died very badly, very miserable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes were dug out, his ears were crushed by something, and his heart was leaking outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead body was forced by the external force to kneel on the ground and seemed to be praying for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body is as scared as it is drained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are blood everywhere on the ground, and the room is full of pungent smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus bent down and reached out and squeezed a drop of blood and said: "It’s a magician, there is nothing wrong with it."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magician is a mysterious profession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knowledge of the Master of the Demon Hunter is beyond the imagination of ordinary people, like Jerome is proficient in all potions. He only needs to lick the blood to distinguish the subtle taste of the potion that he has taken, thus distinguishing the real career. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance, language, and even thinking can lie, but the blood flowing in your body cannot lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Su Ge’s heart is deeper in awe, and his heart decides more, and he can’t let Sears meet Bernice and Jelos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leather boots stepped on the blood into the room, and Jerouss swept around his eyes, then keenly underneath a layer of blood on the ground and found a complete Transparent array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand with the black leather glove directly plucked the thick blood on the ground, and the other palm of Gerros painted a weird pattern in the air, then down A beat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hula ah......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of fire burns, and the target of flame burning is the ground On the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of flame is very special, they only burn blood, although it will slightly burn other things, but it does not hurt much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
