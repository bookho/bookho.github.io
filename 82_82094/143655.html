			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conference room, Sug saw Adeline holding his cockroach, cocking his legs and looking at his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to speak, but Randall stopped: "She just heard the voice of my master, it seems to have a deep feeling, has maintained this way An hour, this makes the disturbance very dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded, turned and looked at the four sitting in the corner, a dull face, saliva, nose Four people across the stream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What information can you ask?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall shook his head: "No, their spirit has completely collapsed. Memory and reason are engulfed by fear and madness. It is memory loss." + Stupid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugton fell silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can't release it, they have serious remnants. If you see it at a high level, it's easy to find us troubles and even find clues." Can't stay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge's eyes gradually cooled down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes slowly swept over Gryman’s old face and said: “When you decide to kill others, you must also be ready to be killed. Preparation for death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Randall’s face flashed a slight approval: "Then I will deal with them!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it's best not to stay with your body." Su Ge screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard this Randall is a bit embarrassed: "This is really sorry, I have a lot of ways to kill. But I don’t leave the body, I will not "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looks awkward and curiously asks: "Would you not have that kind of green flame? You can burn all the tissues of the human body." "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall shook his head and then said with a hint of dignity on his face: "Apostle, if you have seen such a flame, be careful. The flame itself is a kind of original fire. This level of flame can only be used by the Green Flame Brotherhood bishop level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop!? One of the original fires?" Su Ge listened, and suddenly re-examined Bart's position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall asks: "What about the four apostles?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge waved his hand: "Prevent accidents, kill first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall's elegant nuances, turned and waved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his sleeve, he flew out four bats and dark bats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four bats are dark, if not the scarlet eyes, they think it is a black piece of paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four bats squatted on the necks of four people, and took a quick bite and quickly flew back to Randall's sleeves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this finished?" Su Ge saw this look unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, the four people's body began to violently twitch, and then the mouth was wide as if breathing was very difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than ten seconds, the four people’s bodies glimpsed, and they were so dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge didn’t ask much, didn’t even take a look, turned and sat down: “I will handle the body, then we should discuss how to deal with the remaining invasion. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the description of the intruder, Randall thinks it is quite appropriate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is now the territory of my lord, anyone who enters without permission to sneak in and engage in things is an intruder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Adelin on the side seemed to suddenly feel something, and returned to the face of his face was not very good, said: "Sug, the situation is not very good." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Su Ge hurriedly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adeline’s face was dignified: “I’m on the north side of the farm and the demon is wiped out.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chengbei Farm!?" Hearing this sensitive vocabulary, Sugton looked very ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This side, a dark bat flew back along the cracks in the side, Randall listened to his face and suddenly his face was very angry and said: "This Group of damn guys! I want to smash you all!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Landall Sug, who suddenly saw such anger, hurriedly asked: "What happened? ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall took a deep breath and angered and said: "The group of Green Flame Brotherhood and the madman of the Institute of Polar Studies actually carry us. Suddenly opened the sacrifice ceremony on the north side of the farm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!?" When he heard this, Suger was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall opened his mouth to reveal his fangs, and his black robes were filled with black mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The lord of my Lord is not tarnished, I will kill all of this scum now!" After that, Randall will fly out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, don't worry!" Su Ge seems to feel something here and stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, the door of the conference room was suddenly pushed open, and Hills and Bonice rushed in: "Apostle, not good." !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind the two people is a gloomy and anxious Bart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bat strode in, his eyes suddenly see a nail as the nail shrinks after seeing Randall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the quality of his heart made him instantly return to normal, quickly said: "We immediately rushed to the north of the farm, the call of the original fire has begun!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Su Ge’s most trusted people in the entire city are all there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall stared at Bart, full of threats: "Do you dare to come here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Suger raised his hand and said: "Don't misunderstand, Bart is my partner. He is the head of the Green Flame Brotherhood headquarters to stop the call of this rebellious branch."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no time to explain! Get on the bus first, we will say on the road in detail!" Bart is even more anxious than Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall spreads his wings: "I don't have to, go first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; , turned into a black mist disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline pointed at the four bodies and asked, "What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I will come back to deal with it, go quickly!" Bart said quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group then quickly sat on the luxury carriage of Patna and rushed to the farm on the outskirts of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still good to be located in the northeast of the city, not far from the farm in the north of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running in the city, it is obvious that the whole city is stirred up by an invisible force and becomes very impetuous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The well-organized streets of the past are now in chaos, and the city’s police rushed back and forth, making traffic that was already blocked more congested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Bart is very prescient, and has prepared an alternate route early. Although everyone has spared some roads, they quickly rushed to the farm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the car, Su Ge quickly asked about the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart has a special feeling for the summoning array. After feeling a bit of a sign, he quickly ran out with two people from Hills, through the induction of two people. , directly found the Su Ge located here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now summons has entered the stage of sacrifice. We must stop it only at this stage, or we will have no way to wait until the coming stage!" Bart face Pale, sweat on his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s face is not very good, turn to ask Adeline: “Here should be the leader of the Green Flame Brotherhood and the Institute of Polar Research? Why is this?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline sighed: “The guys are a group of mad believers, I can’t use common sense to measure their habits. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
