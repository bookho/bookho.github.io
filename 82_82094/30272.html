			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After breakfast, the two sisters rushed to clean up and put on the school uniform and quickly rushed to the college. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing the table, Su Ge opened the closet and took out his second set, which was also the last clean and tidy suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rough shirt made of linen is not very good to wear on the body. At this time, Su Ge misses his own clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing a shirt and suit, Su Ge nodded in the mirror and looked satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth in the mirror have dark blond hair and fair skin, dark eyebrows and a pair of gods with double eyelids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cheeks are a little thin, the nose is tall, and the chin's beard is clean, although not handsome, but it is not annoying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect to look the same as I used to, that is, hair color and skin color have changed. It seems that crossing him is not random and accidental. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pick up the black bowler hat on the coat rack, put on the black coat, put on the glove and put the cane, Su Ge looks in this mirror This mysterious and elegant gentleman sighed: "Sure enough, people rely on clothes and horses to lean on the saddle. This dress is worn, I feel a lot of handsome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ready for the clothes, Su Ge grabbed a change from the drawer of the desk and put it in his pocket. Once again, check that the gas in the room is all closed, then smash it and lock the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow under last night was very big, and it is still falling apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing I feel when I walk out of the house is a cold chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow in the front yard has been cleaned up by someone, and there is a path that can be taken away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the street, you can see that people are coming and going on the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s half past seven, it’s the peak time for people to go to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on the side of the road, Su Ge looked into the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streets are covered with snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are pedestrians on foot, there are nobles in carriages, and even steam locomotives with steam and black smoke are driving along the railroad tracks on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjust the angle of the top hat so that the hat can cover the falling snow, and Sug walks toward the Bain police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where Su Ge lived was not far from the police station. After three streets, he saw a gray-white five-story building at a wide intersection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the plaque at the gate of the first floor, the words "Bern West City Police Station"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; However, what really makes people eye-catching is not the handsome building, but the two huge steam robots under the doorstep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two robots are tall and at least four meters high. The body is covered with silver metal armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two gemstones with red light on the head of the humanoid. With the rotation of the head, they watched the situation with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the back, from time to time, hot steam is sprayed, two-meter-long giant steam gear rifles are held in both hands, and the two small six-tube Gatlings are on the shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the steam robot, it is simply a warrior! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is incredible, Su Ge has to admit that these even in the electronic information age can not complete the precision machinery, indeed through the steam engine to provide power. ·<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The science and technology talent tree of this world is completely biased." Su Ge sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steam robot is just the tip of the iceberg. In his memory, Su Ge also saw the steamship that was more than 70 meters long and made of steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was really a black technology, and the shocking effect of Su Ge even exceeded the Sky Mothership that appeared in the Avengers 1. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Converging in the heart, Su Gemai went to the police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This crossroads is very crowded, and due to the early peaks, the concentration of people is called the Imperial Capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the traffic police here is very professional and dedicated. Under the dredge of the three traffic police, there is no blockage at the intersection. People are methodical. go ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge mixed in the flow of people slowly, while the eyes looked at the people of this era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clothing of the people here is the style of the early industrial revolution, ordinary workers wearing overalls of rough canvas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle class with some technology wears more ordinary suits and thin coats, just like Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those who have real money and knowledge are generally wearing silk hats, wearing good cotton suits or tuxedos, and wearing beautifully outside. The plush coat, holding a sandalwood cane inlaid with extravagant gold, is full of brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the flow of people across the road, Su Ge stood under the steps of the police station and carefully glanced at the two robots and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just stepping up the steps, Su Ge happened to see a middle-aged man in a blue police uniform wearing a blue police uniform, two people Sai Pei’s courtesy after seeing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment Su Ge took off his hat, two people simultaneously stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because two people know each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge looked at the middle-aged people with some tension and fear, and the middle-aged people looked at Su Ge's expression full of shock and horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two seconds later, Sugge smiled and took the hat and turned and left quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is called Jess Pisco. According to the memory of Suger Sotos, this person is a middle-level member of the death sect. He already possesses the mysterious power. Legend has it that he has the ability to control the body of the deceased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the church, Su Ge and he have seen a lot of times, because he and Su Ge's teacher: John Ross is better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the most important thing is that when he killed Su Ge and wanted to make Su Ge a soulless warrior, Jess was there and helped. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! This guy is actually a policeman in the police station!" Su Ge never dreamed that he thought he could break away from death through death and death. The next day I met the people of the death sect and killed the accomplice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Ge quickly left, Jess had reacted from the horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No mistakes, no mistakes, this person is definitely Suger Sotos. Why he didn't die!? It was already drowned. Is our method successful!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! There should be no success. He didn't have his own consciousness after success. I just saw his fear and nervousness. This guy is not dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! He must have come to the police, no! Never let him continue to live!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Jess’s eyes flashed with sinister poison: “You must get rid of you!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pistol at his waist, staring at the back of Su Ge's departure, quickly followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Su Ge, who walked to the street, felt that Jess was quietly following himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do? Calmly think about it, the police can't go. Who knows how many other accomplices there are there? Go in and get me a crime that I don't have. Shooting, I can't run without it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Su Ge’s heart is full of anxiety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s already been stared, and it’s impossible to escape. He holds the information from my family. Even if I ran, he might attack me. Family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge suddenly flashed a cold and anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
