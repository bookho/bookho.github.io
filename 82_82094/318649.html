			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At nine o'clock in the evening, Su Ge blurred his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headache has subsided with the recovery of the psionics, getting up from the bed, undressing and walking into the spa bathroom next door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the warm and comfortable hot spring bath, Su Ge is a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today's battle is somewhat thrilling, but it is really very exciting and exciting." Recalling the battle during the day, Su Ge was very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now my short board is mainly in the aspect of psionics."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Su Ge has completely entered this system and has begun to touch deep things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially this battle, let him have a deep understanding of the profession of the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They can transform their bodies into corpses, and the most important things in the body can be eliminated through necromantics. This ability is really tricky." Hayden picked up his arm and his throat was broken and he was still alive and kicking. Su Ge paid more attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ability of the night-time prisoner should not only be so, but also have time to look at "The Evening Clock of the Glen" to explore deep knowledge." Su Ge Close your eyes and lie in the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the shower, Su Ge came back in a bathrobe and saw a cute white little sheep standing on his bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly ran over and pinched it, entered his own psionic power, and Emilia’s voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sug, it’s been four days since the last report, how is the situation there?" Emilia’s voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge organized the language here, and then said the situation here truthfully, of course, will not say Randall, but emphasizes I am working with Mill's work and have gained their trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side, in the Bishop's room in Bain City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to Emilia wearing pink silk pajamas, she was satisfied with her eyebrows: "This time people's choices are very correct. Four days have not only won trust, but also investigated the distribution and scope of power in the city. The ability has been quite good in this generation, and there are not many such talents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After this incident, his merits are enough to be competent bishops. If they are distributed inside the empire, those old guys will definitely not agree and will suppress. If so, then assign him there and let him supervise the Guinness Kingdom is the most appropriate."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Emilia responded with some encouraging words, and hinted at Su Ge's future position, while letting him continue his efforts, if you need help, you can always contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Su Ge listened to his mouth slightly tilted up: "Sure enough, since you cooperate, then I am welcome."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, Su Ge did not sleep. Instead, sit cross-legged and improve your psionic power through meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, after Su Ge had finished eating breakfast and put his own cumbersome equipment on his body, Hills ran over: "Mr. The assassin woke up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg nodded his cuffs, put on his hat, picked up his cane, and looked at the precision and elegance in the mirror. The young man nodded with satisfaction: "Go, go see!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Hills looked at the Pope’s heart, because she suddenly It has been found that His Majesty the Pope seems to pay great attention to his grooming today. In short, he is paying more and more attention to dressing up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Do you have a girl you like?" asked Hills tempted in the hallway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was the first person to follow Su Ge, and she was not afraid of Su Ge, so she was more open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened, then smiled: "Not yet, how did you suddenly ask this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just feel that you seem to be paying more and more attention to your instrument today." Hills answered truthfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge silenced and smiled slightly: "As the identity changes, the person's mentality will change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills heard this somewhat deep words meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here Su Ge thought about it carefully, and he found that he really paid more attention to his own appearance than in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it because of the influence of the gods?" Su Ge thought in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thinking of the gods is very particular about the face, appearance and momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't think about it, it's not a bad thing to pay attention to appearance." Su Ge adjusted his mind and focused on the assassin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Suge came to the ward, she saw Elena sitting next to her bed, and Connor, who was pale on the bed, sat up slightly and leaned on the bed, her lips pale Chapped, gray skin with some sallow, standard patient appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing Su Ge, Connor first thanked: "Thank you for your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge smiled and said directly: "The situation is more urgent, I will not deny it, accept your gratitude. Then Mr. Assassin, can you tell us why the people of the Institute of Polar Research are going to kill you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found them a major evil plan." With that in mind, Connor looked positive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squinted and asked: "What evil plan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connor is not directly Answer, facing Elena: "Since this is the palace, I hope this thing can be described in person and by the Queen, because this matter is related to the life of the entire Guinness Kingdom."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina immediately got up: "No problem, wait a moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, turn and leave quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connor looked at Su Ge and explained: "Sorry, this matter is very important. I must say to my Majesty the Queen."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
