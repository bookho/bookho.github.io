			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two did not stop in the lobby, but walked along the corridor on the west side of the building to the warehouse where Joseph was being held. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would it be okay to walk in such a bright light?" Walking in the hallway, Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart looked at the front and asked, "What? Feeling that we have invested in the net?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It's a bit like this." Su Ge nodded bluntly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart asked: "Have you ever experienced the battle between mysteries?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge stunned and then nodded truthfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is now setting himself to be a devout believer who gains knowledge directly through the gods, and is not proficient in human occultism, and does not need it in this regard. Deliberate concealment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart explained: "The battle between mystery is different from ordinary people. The ordinary people will destroy the body, while the mystery focuses on destroying the spirit and will. For the mystery The flesh is just a container. Although the most effective way to kill a person is to destroy the flesh, for the mysterious person, destroying his flesh does not mean that he is victorious and safe. Through the curse of the soul after death, or entanglement Even turning into a nightmare can be very troublesome, so the mysterious battle will try to destroy his spirit or soul before others die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge finished Nod in my heart, those who have become cursed and cursed. He has seen many in the movie. The intangible and intangible things are the most difficult. Now, under this world view, this situation is even more intensified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So people who have become official mysteries never pay attention to physical attacks, focusing on the collision of knowledge. I have checked it before I came in, here and There are no psionic traps, and mysterious workshops, some are just mysterious people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Bart’s face flashed a self-channel: "And Me, they are their natural enemies!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the confident Bart, Su Ge has a little peace and moves on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, the two returned to the previous warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, however, the warehouse has been gone to the building, and even a trace of blood and traces on the ground have not been left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough." Sug sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not stupid. After knowing that they have not killed Su Ge, they will definitely not continue here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it really gone?" Bart’s voice was so cold that he turned and suddenly burned a green flame in his hand and slammed behind Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷嗷嗷嗷! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Su Ge suddenly uttered a scream of harsh bullying in the space behind nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s body stretched out in an instant, suddenly turned back and leaned against Bart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bad Inbass!" suddenly screamed and suddenly echoed throughout the warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this sound, a lot of reddish ripples appeared in Su Ge’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg instantly locks the direction of the ripples, eyes staring at the corner of the warehouse loudly: "Where!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart had some accidents, looking around Su Ge’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a glimpse of gray halo, a middle-aged man in a black tuxedo with a black top hat gradually appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart saw a faint saying: "Who I thought it was, it was Nielsen! The waste magician who was expelled by the Brotherhood actually joined the group of madmen. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man called Nelson slightly raised his head, a pair of bloody eyes staring at Bart, biting his teeth: "The old guy is really daring, actually dare Let you come over and investigate us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart doesn't want to talk nonsense, asks directly: "What about containers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Hey, the container is full, the original fire is coming!" Nielsen looked mad, then the hand in his hand waved forward, his mouth froze, and dozens of black-painted pigeons flew over here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cane in the hands of Bart skillfully rotated a circle, raised his hand and waved forward, and a large number of green flames appeared, burning most of these pigeons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't touch them!" Bart cautioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge cautiously asked: "Is the physical attack effective?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened to the cane in his hand and turned into a chain sword form, then the arm muscles squirmed, the chain sword instantly extended, and several slips The fish is shredded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪叽! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shredded pigeon fell on the ground like a pool of ink, and it also had a faint black mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bart on the side saw Suege’s weapon in his hand, and his expression suddenly shocked. Because the structure and principle of this weapon has gone far beyond the scope of his cognitive science. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The original, the last mad believer was like this weapon." Bart's heart flashed when he was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time he did not see how Su Ge killed the mad believers, when he arrived, Su Ge was watching the body in a daze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You really are not ordinary gods!!" Seeing this magical weapon, Nielsen's face was gloomy and gradually believed in the words of his companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squeezed the handle and asked, "What about your accomplices? The one who just attacked me? Is it because of fear of running?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is an apprentice too arrogant?" The voice didn't know where it was coming from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pigeons on the ground turned into ink and suddenly burned a black flame, and a massive black dense fog instantly flooded the warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bart!?" Deep in the fog, Su Ge screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, no one responded to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it illusion?" Su Ge whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really illusion?" The voice reappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sugg’s eyes again saw the ripples that belonged to the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it illusory? I will know if I try." After the previous attack, Su Ge has been much more stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running at a high speed in the direction of the ripples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fog, a young man in a white coat with a pale face holds a green knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, his face is not very good, and there are even two tiny curved wounds on his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the result of a previous attack on Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his spirit can make Sugg into the environment, his own spirit can be cut by the sudden emergence of the blade, not only his mental damage, but even It also deals damage to his skin through psionic energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what kind of knowledge, but the apprentice is an apprentice after all! Before I was hypnotized by some sounds, it was not thorough. This time I entered my Nightmare space, I want to unload your soul!" The young man said, very abnormally sticking out his tongue and licking the green knife in his hand, the body wanders like a ghost in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this level of consciousness, he is invincible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge, who was running in the fog, suddenly felt a gust of wind blowing, followed by a green dagger in his vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry!" Su Ge reacted instantly, and the chain sword in his hand suddenly rushed forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
