			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this growth of vision, Su Ge has now been relatively calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth of spiritual vision, while making people's spirits gradually non-human, will also enhance people's vision and tolerance for mysterious events. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a series of previous events, Sogge, who has already arrived at 20 o'clock, has had some patience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug disconnected the spiritual link and opened his eyes. Roland asked with a worried look: "How about Su Ge, Macock?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s calm explanation: “There is nothing wrong with you, and Macock’s appearance is indeed influenced by mystery.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this Roland is relieved because she is very afraid that this is the nature of Markock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is influenced by mystery, there is still the possibility of cure. If this is the nature, then her future can only choose one of the endless sufferings and escape marriage. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland gently grabbed Macock’s hand and asked, “Is there a possibility of healing?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Suge silenced: "I try my best, but first look at his clinic. I guess the core problem should be at the clinic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Roland whispered: "Is it related to the female body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The female body you mentioned before? Oh, yes, I forgot to ask, how can he have a female body in a private clinic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous focus was on Roland’s experience, this strange situation Forgot to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland explained: "The female body was the body that the police commissioned him to carry out a preliminary autopsy. You may not know that the police have fewer forensic doctors, our police station. The forensic doctor is one of Adam. So sometimes we will entrust some doctors with sufficient prestige and credibility to help us inspect the body, which is more costly and cost-effective. Macock is one of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before this, Macock had helped me to test the six bodies. They were all very accurate and there was no error."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "The female body Where is it now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still in Macock. This is a pregnant woman who died while producing, but the problem of death is rather odd and there is a larger The controversy, so stay here for the time being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and began to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sound that just squirmed should be the one that I can't see and the friction of the meat. I can't see it with my current vision, indicating the level of this thing. At least two, or even higher. This is a bit of a hassle, and this thing seems to be something that I can handle alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Su Ge falls into In a dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a long time, Su Ge got the conclusion: "Let's go through the situation first, if you can't solve it, go straight back to the rescue."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is the rescuer looking for?" This question is in a meditation. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the masters of Gerlos, today’s churches seem to have no more senior and reliable clergy than the bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;叮铃铃......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A carriage rides past the front, hanging in front The bell made a clear sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right! And Mr. Rogan!" When he heard the ringtone, Suggton thought of the leader of the night watchman Rogan Osman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, his knowledge is similar to that of Jeros Master. Just Bart said that the night watchman who survived two years ago is likely to be Mr. Rogan. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, the carriage has slowly stopped and arrived at the destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock’s private clinic is located in the middle of the wealthy and financial districts on the southwest side of the city. It can be said to be a land of gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Located at the intersection of Kaixuan Road and Sunshine Road, the clinic is an exquisite two-story building surrounded by a small circle surrounded by fences, exquisite and stylish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this small building, Su Ge finally knew that Roland was treated like this, and his parents were firmly on the side of the perpetrator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door outside the clinic is not locked, and there are several footprints in the snow in the side yard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong man on the side explained: "Mr. I have been here this morning, and then I went to Miss Bowman."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You two carry him!" Roland helped Macock walk down and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two brawny rushed past with a quick step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland came over and took out a bunch of keys, pushed the door open and followed the steps to the door to open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing you can see after entering is a relatively large hall with two rows of seats on either side, which should be the waiting position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a counter, it should be the ground of the registered nurse, there is a corridor leading to the inner side of the counter, and the end of the corridor is the staircase leading to the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, because there is no one, the house is quiet and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took the lead and went to see it and found that there was nothing wrong with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒,啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hard soles step on the floor and make a very harsh sound in the open clinic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge tightens his cane and walks slowly, constantly observing the situation around him, hoping to determine all the mysterious situations in this room in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Roland walked in with two bodyguards and Macock, he asked, "What should I do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge raised his hand to indicate that the four people were temporarily parked here: "Tell me the location of the female corpse. I will go through the situation first, and you will stand here, don't move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Roland listened to his solemn force and nodded, then followed and said: "Go along the corridor, turn left and enter the basement. After opening the basement door, there are three doors, the largest on the left hand side. That door is the door of the morgue, and I saw his anomaly there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Roland threw the keychain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge grabbed the keychain and nodded slightly, and stepped forward to follow the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While advancing, Su Ge squeezed his cane and said in his heart: "There was some recklessness coming over this time, and the silver blood medicines were not brought over."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver Blood Pharmacy is a commonly used exorcist for church clergy, similar to the rifles used by previous priests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary weapons have little effect on mystery, but if you apply a silver weapon to an ordinary weapon, you can attach a strong mystery. Force, thus causing effective attacks against ghosts that exceed natural phenomena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under normal circumstances, this medicine is always on the body, but today is the Crescent Moon Festival, and Su Ge, who has changed his clothes, has no body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the corridor, one staircase to the left and right, one to the upper floor and one to the underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the stairs leading to the ground is a thick black iron door that looks like a solid feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing in front of the door, Suge closed his eyes and used the psionics to call himself inspiration as a priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This inspiration is similar to the beast instinct, it can expand the human perception, telling yourself what is in front of you through the mysterious power of the underworld Causes a huge threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the simple test, Su Ge’s inspiration did not have the sense of acupuncture and tremor before being attacked. It was very smooth and not abnormal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
