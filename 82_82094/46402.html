			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After simply confirming the situation, Su Ge did not stay here for too long, and all caution would not be harmful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Lobo walking on the way back to the city, Su Ge thought of a possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two people today are completely different from the two before, and people will change with age. A few days ago I have seen the portraits of the two of them, and they are very young children. The appearance and gap are huge. But there will be three similarities. If you want to change the look of the two people slightly, they should be able to integrate. The life of a normal person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the way to meditation, Su Ge has unconsciously returned home with his feet full of snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as soon as he entered the house, he saw Black's brow looking at the drawings and thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger cleaned the snow on Luobo and changed shoes to take off his clothes and walk in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you thinking?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black held his chin and said: "The steam engine is too bloated now, there are a lot of useless materials and structures inside, I wonder if I can streamline it." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened to his head and looked at his drawings in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black unexpectedly looked at the serious Su Ge, curiously asked: "Detective adults are really interested in machinery?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squinted and said, "No way, your brother is now a church interns. If you don't want to be a police detective for a lifetime, you must join the church. The church encourages clergy to conduct science. Research, this can be promoted quickly, since there is a chance to seize the right, so I am also ready to study the knowledge of science and technology."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God! If the news is to be known by Winnie, it is expected to jump up with joy." Black said with amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wennie has always opposed the history of Su Ge to learn, she and her parents are more hope that Su Ge can learn some of the skills used, such as mechanical manufacturing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at that time, Su Ge was still based on his own interests and chose history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the structure of the steam engine on the drawing, similar to the steam engine drawings he had seen on the network before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of technology has been around for many years, and engineers have repeatedly improved the steam engine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is even a mysterious knowledge added to important machines to improve the quality of machine materials and reduce volume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger looked at the lap in detail and reluctantly wrote down most of the things, laughing haha: "Sure enough, this thing is not a look at it." Can learn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black heard the grin and said: "If you learn it when you see it, then our group of researchers can die." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled again and returned to his bedroom and said, "I decided to sleep for a while, these days I have to take the feeling that I am missing today. Make up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black nodded and continued to study his drawings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the world of dreams, Sug sat on the throne and quickly re-emerged the related machinery he had just seen in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, like the analytical form of a supercomputer, the structure diagram of the steam engine is instantaneously decomposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cylinders, condensers, pistons, flywheels, crankshafts, internal levers, gears, etc., incomparably detailed data form a large, very intuitive 3D stereo image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thin, I want to streamline the structure." Su Ge thought, the brain began to run at speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, through a high-level thinking far beyond humans, the structure in front of it quickly transforms the combination, the size of the gear, the device of the transmission, the way the piston works, etc. , have formed a new program. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these programs evolved again and again, the steam engine actually changed from a large volume of three people to only half a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structure has been greatly optimized, but the requirements for materials have also been greatly improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge returned to see the record of this road optimization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a total of seven optimizations from the beginning to reduce the crankshaft size, reduce the useless gear rotation, and finally adjust the position structure to the final overall configuration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting such a result, Su Ge nodded with satisfaction and recorded all seven of these results and he withdrew from the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These inventions appear too prominently out of me, but they will naturally appear from my highly skilled younger brother. From now to the seventh The ultimate form of evolution is too large, and I should remind him a little bit without a trace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Su Ge sat up and looked at the pocket watch and slept It was two hours and it is now lunch time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first optimization is to slightly reduce the volume, improve the efficiency of the steam engine and increase the power. The transformation is small, but the effect is good. Such progress There is no problem in Black's body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of Suger’s calculation, the door rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sug, have a meal." It was Winnie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put out the hair and go out and see that Black is still sitting on the couch and studying the drawings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eye turned and went over and asked: “Still studying?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I just drew a few optimized sketches, but it won't work. One less piece will cause some other troubles.” Black holds a pencil in his hand and his face is tangled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s casually bent over and looked at it, laughing and laughing: “This huge bearing is so stupid, these gears are also very inevitable. You can take these gears off and change the structure. It would be fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like a casual word from an outsider who doesn't understand anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black naturally did not take it seriously, thinking that his brother was just talking about it and continuing his drawing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not continue to say it, laughing: "Dinner, big inventor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When you are finished, sit at the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wennie rubbed her hand with her apron and sat down, watching Black smile and said: "Black will be an outstanding master of mechanics in the future."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took the fork and said, "I think so too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will take these two When the gear is finished, eat it. You should eat it first.” Black is now on the ground, drawing carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people know the serious character of the younger brother, not to mention starting to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Black draws the place that Su Ge just said, his mind can’t help but think of his brother’s casual words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How easy is this thing? Reduce a few gears? How...etc! Look, reduce these gears, turn that side The gears below the shaft are slightly enlarged, which seems to not only reduce the unnecessary power consumption, but also reduce the volume slightly. If you follow this line of thought, the distance around the entire crankshaft can be reduced after the reduction. And the diameter seems to have the possibility of optimization... The goddess is on, this is really ok!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people who are eating here suddenly heard an excitement Shouting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Winnie was shocked, and some blamed: "Black, what are you doing??"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This piece of Black's eyes, excitedly watching Su Ge said: "Brother! You are a genius! I thought of it! I thought of it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; At this time, he did not realize the hidden reminder of Su Ge, but thought he was inspired by Su Ge’s unintentional words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
