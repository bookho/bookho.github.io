			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the very comfortable lying of Su Ge, the fear of Duke and others has come to the extreme, even the three people faintly feel the strange things It seems to gradually come out of the darkness and come to the house through windows and walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;滋滋滋......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overhead light seems to be subject to interference, the current produces a sharp Stable, the light bulb began to flicker, and even the entire room was caught in a horrible environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assassin three people leaned together and looked pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, they feel the air becomes damp, and it seems that the space is becoming thicker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roof seems to have condensed drops of water falling on their heads and faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the beads are very viscous and carry a strange and unpleasant smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, three people thought that this was not a waterdrop at all, but the saliva of a certain monster,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the entire room is now surrounded by horrible monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blur, they feel that they are being squeezed in the middle of a group of humans, and the space becomes crowded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the space they can't see, there is a lot of greedy eyes watching themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind of greedy gaze is like a hungry butcher staring at three livestock to be slaughtered, thinking about how to kill, while still I think which part of their body tastes good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unspeakable in panic, Wright was the first to lose to reason Mastery, screaming and fainting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke’s heart is still pretty good, although the whole body is shaking, but the hand is still clenching his cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side of Stephen, the expression was sluggish, and his eyes looked straight ahead. He seemed to see some kind of horrible monster. He said in a mutter: "I finally know why so many people will take the initiative to give up their minds and devote themselves to madness. "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, his face was pale, like a dead man turning his head mechanically, and the eyes of a big man looked at Duke without a god: "Because For the existence of this horror, only by abandoning reason can you obtain salvation, in order to obtain peace, and to continue to survive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he gradually accelerated, double The eyes are faintly red, and there are signs of animalization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing two people around him fainted, one is about to fall into madness, and Duke, who lost his reliance, suddenly raised his cane and shouted: "I! Duke Hausman is a believer in the Lord of Great Death and Storm, a person of the Great Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His, his face is reddish, Almost hysterical swearing: "Monsters! God's believers will not be afraid of you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This snoring is full of sound, it seems that all the fears of Duke, all The anger, all the courage has come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound reverberates in the hall, giving people a feeling of sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it’s a pity that the monsters don’t seem to care about his howl and still stay close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after this scream, Duke’s whole person completely wilted, sitting on the sofa and muttering: “I’m really damn here. "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;滋滋滋......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light flashes faster and faster, the brighter The less you come, the more dark you are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stab! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sound of an electric spark, the living room instantly fell into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything was dark, and Duke was helpless and heard Steven’s gradual, heavy, non-human gasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of some flesh movements in the dark, the sound of scales rubbing, and the sound of low saliva. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Duke feels that the claws, fangs, and even the tongue are immediately attached to his face...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slow bell came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bell is completely different from the previous bell, because the bell is from the big clock of the Star Clock Tower in the city center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there was no special feeling in the past, but with a special rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the rhythm, desperate, helpless, and fearful Duke gradually calmed down, as if he had heard the sacred bell again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the bell came, Duke noticed that the monsters in the dark seemed to stop approaching themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Hausmann, your courage and piety are very moving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companion With the arrival of a steady male voice, the switch was turned on and the hall was restored to brightness again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke is just like climbing from hell to heaven, and the feeling of being saved in despair makes Duke cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head in tears and saw a man in a gray suit with a bloody red hair with four thirty or forty years old The female stood at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young man looks handsome, with gray moustaches and bloody red hair in the waves, giving a contradictory man who is both suffocating and elegant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man stood at the door, with a sultry smile on his face, with approval and appreciation on his face, continued: "The believers of God will not be afraid You, this sentence is very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm! The better the taste, the better!" The man nodded constantly and looked happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ieta, standing beside him, whispered, "What about the deputy bishops who are attracted to these people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man looked up, gray Look into the empty room and take out a small black clock with a palm-sized hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little bell is a mysterious costume that has been treated by Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect is to release his unique, divine night sound when the first sound is made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man clenched the little bell, his attitude with full respect and shouted: "Ugly monsters! Now feel the sacred night clock of this valley, experience the death Field!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three bursts of heavy, even spread a slower bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three bells spread rapidly along with three black ripples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the bulbs in the room are broken and the world is once again in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, Duke touched his tears, but he was full of pride and courage, like a child who was brought to his father after being bullied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;叽叽叽,嗷嗷,嘶嘶嘶...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Squeaky, various Unspeakable, unimaginable screams in the dark living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, the empty living room has become a zoo full of various animals, and there are all kinds of harsh and unpleasant sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke stood up and stood there proudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can still feel the monsters, the scales, the bones and the teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, he felt that these monsters were full of panic, as if they saw the most terrible existence, and were fleeing in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
