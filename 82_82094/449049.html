			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s voice echoed and dissipated, Randall’s squatting on the ground, his arrogance and enthusiasm: “This is the servant of my Lord, eternal enshrined Lord, my Lord shines forever!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The voice just fell, Randall felt an invisible force on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This power is terrifying and unfathomable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complex array appeared at Randall's side, an ice-blue seal descended from the sky and came to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Randall, your contribution will be rewarded today, and your achievements will be recognized. Now my Lord is about to give you one point of infinite power. This kind of power will make you become the knight of my Lord, out of the blood and embrace the new world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s voice came one after another, Randall listened More and more excited, but did not dare to look up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While being grateful to the Lord, he is even more awe and respectful to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, in the face of this situation, the Pope can still talk about it, and can even walk around the hall and look directly at the main form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not the person who bears the taboo family name. This kind of existence is far beyond my imagination." Randall wondered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, accept glory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s voice came again, the seal lived instantly The same, soaring directly printed on Randall's chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Randall felt that his soul was about to explode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...this is the Lord..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he feels A sea of ​​ocean water descends from the sky, pouring into the body with the power and momentum that can destroy the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a breathing room, he feels that his soul is filled and can explode at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Terror, it’s too horrible!" Randall couldn’t describe it with this power, couldn’t analyze it, and couldn’t think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he felt like he was going to die, a bell rang quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aftermath of the bell acts on his body and immediately calms him down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the horrible power of the ocean is like a reaction after the contact with the bell, quickly shrinking and purifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea becomes the essence of concentration, and they are like a myriad of elves swimming in Randall's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall’s eyes are on the ground, but the spirit is clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that the bondage in his soul is completely cut off, as if the weight of the soul that binds his soul is finally out of the ordinary, incomparably refreshing and comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, these elves are like crystal clear water, completely washing his soul, he can feel the stinking blood is quickly washed away by this water, Finally, the unrecognized power is integrated into the blood, and the filth of his fear and boredom finally disappears without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the power of the Lord? Too comfortable, I want to return to the embrace of the Lord. This is the most comfortable time from birth to the present." Del feels better than ever, and has never been better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the soul was washed clean, Randall immediately heard a scream of wind and howling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the gentle water in the blink of an eye turned into countless thousands of years of ice, they became spikes, connected to each other, piercing the soul of Randall . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Randall did not feel any pain, but there was an unspeakable comfort...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Su Ge tilted his legs against the throne and looked at Randall, who had become an ice sculpture, nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"High vampires, the ability to accept is much stronger than the original Hills and Bernice. The bloody holy pool is still a bit of something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge through God The body clearly saw Randall's body structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall is not a person, its body is a vampire bat. The red energy that sustains his body is the pool of bloody holy pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This pool of water is the result of the infinite dilution of the blood of a certain god. From this point of view, the bloody holy pool and Guinness should be almost They all have the sacredness of a certain god, or... curse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pool of bloody holy pool gives Randall a superb power. But it also erodes his soul like a skeleton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first time I met, Su Ge discovered that his soul was full of blood and was seriously corroded. This time it was even more serious and it began to corrode the soul. Heart and brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Surely enter the realm of the gods, all things are equal, people and animals are nourishment." Su Ge said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger can count, when the blood is completely occupied by the soul, it will completely erode Randall’s reason and transform him into a monster eager for blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monsters have no blood in their bodies, so they are eager for blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will suck the blood of all living things, and these blood will instantly drain and return to the hands of a certain existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue, these monsters will always craving blood, but they will never fill up, just like a bottomless pit, creating a loop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The so-called bloody holy pool, but a machine that produces slaves, and actually enshrine it?" Su Ge's tone with disdain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, the ice-blue statue gradually appeared a slight crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gradual cracks become larger and the entire ice sculpture is broken and collapses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Randall and the original Hills experienced a completely different process, and his form changed directly in his dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no change in his appearance, but the whole body has turned into ice blue, surrounded by the mist of the orchids, like the foggy elves, style and those The ghost wolf has a similar look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curse, the blood, has been cleaned up, Randall feels like a new life, into a new world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down at his misty hands, Randall squats on the ground again: "Thank you! Thank you for your kindness and reward, the great Lord." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisp footsteps sounded, and Randall knew that the footsteps were under the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not live up to the Lord's gift and expectation for you." Su Ge's calm voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall’s head hit the ground and said solemnly: "Life is not limited, faith does not go out. All of me, I exist for my Lord." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded with satisfaction: "Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall Instead of going straight up on the ground, I bowed down and bowed, and after switching in one direction, I quit and quit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, the temple door closed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher!" Hills was happy to come over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall stood up and looked at Su Ge without knowing what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such grace, even if he is erudite, he does not know what words to use to express his feelings at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Some words don't need to be said, in the heart, the Lord can feel it." Su Ge said to appease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall nodded hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The main storm hunting has a total of twenty-four, divided into three levels. The lowest level of fog hunting twelve, Hills and Cypress Niss belongs to this. You just got the Frost and Cold conquest, a total of eight. You are the first to get this qualification, one will go to the fog to pick a mount and choose your own weapon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall’s heart is so excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With two people walking in the middle of the fog, Su Ge asked: "What is the situation in the recent night?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills nodded slightly: "The mystery of the bottom layer seems to have received news, some commotion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall took the call: "Well, but we still can't find the source of these riots."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded and asked: "How is the distribution of the power of the night?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the Pope’s enthusiasm finally interested in the night, Randall was very happy and hurriedly told the information he had prepared for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The night is a land of three nostalgia, the hands of the three churches are not reachable here. So there are many organizations and cults that cannot be seen on weekdays. Today, in the night, there are five organizations with relatively large forces."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first nature of our Hearst family, our people are already here. Living for thousands of years, is a well-deserved king." Speaking of this, Randall's face is proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and motioned him to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall’s expression continues: “The second force is the homeland of the unnamed old king. There is a land of undead, a completely abandoned land. A lot of knights of the old king were stationed there, although the whole was very broken, but after all, it was something left over from ancient times. There are many mysterious people who will set foot there and seek some opportunities. The knights of the old kings have also opened up in recent years. It seems that he is planning something, so he has sheltered many mysterious people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unknown old king..." Su Ge is a little addicted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
