			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First you need to relax all over the body." Su Ge stood up and his right hand slammed into a smoky blue flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Drake saw the flame, the turbid eyes tightened, and then there was some sickness on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of flame, this power, is what he has been longing for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Su Ge’s right hand danced in the air, using the flame to ink three Keynes runes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are ice, fog, and silver, respectively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three runes present a triangle that surrounds Drake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreck was nervous at the moment: "Mr. Assass, I won't have anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and nodded: "Reassure, you can quickly restore your past health."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Draketon Settle yourself and work hard to relax your nervous spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three runes were swirling around Drake under the control of Su Ge, and then a burst of fog gradually appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s palms are flat and calm, and the expression is calm: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White frost in the abyss Floating in the middle, it is the flagship of the Lord of the Great White Cream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog emerged from the valley, the god of the great misty god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream emerges from the deep abyss, and is connected to the void and the world. It is the world, it is the void, it is the reality, it is the illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also a human fear, and it is also a human desire. In the past, in the future, in the future, hoarfrost condenses from the abyss of dreams, turns into endless fog, surrounds the world, shelters the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lord is the Lord of Storm and Death, the only true God of the Valley and the Abyss, the ruler of dreams, the dominator of death, the master of the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the prayers not far from being read, Su Ge feels that his psionic energy is being consumed quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the disappearance of psionics, a large number of cold gray fogs emerged from the formation of the three runes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these cold fogs in the middle, Drake seems to have entered a new state, at this time his posture is very calm, even arguably Peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his breathing, these cold fogs were gradually inhaled by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that as the fog continues to be inhaled, Drake's appearance quickly recovers at a rate visible to the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weird lines on the skin disappeared, the eyes became clear, and the fishy smell in the wheezing was gone...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the last ten minutes, all the fog was inhaled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a triangular ice blue array formed on Drake's chest. It looks like a strange snowflake, delicate and mysterious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge spit out, just this seal consumed half of his psionic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the concept of Su Ge’s half psionic power, if it is put into an ordinary master, it has been drained! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you feel praying to yourself?" At this time Drake has not returned to God, in a state of peace, Xuelier yin and yang asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "Not bad, much better than asking for his god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Seeing that Su Ge is not warm, Shirley continues to say: "You are really greedy, actually sucking up half of your psionic energy and so many ice flames."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sat down and drank the lipstick tea and said, "No way, after all, it is a child of God. It is very fortunate to be able to seal with half of the psionics. I have just prepared to do all the psionics." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How long can it last?” Shirley asked if the irony didn’t work, so he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the snowflake-like rune and said, "I can guarantee that there are no problems in these two days. I won’t be sure if I wait until that place. I Only the biggest suppression can be maintained. After all, it is not clear the intensity of this coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreak squinted and returned to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, there was an indescribable shock on his face, reaching out and touching his body, then turning his eyes around and finding the strange melting and sticky The thick feeling has completely disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like being completely crawling out of the muddy swamp, it’s incredibly refreshing and refreshing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to God, he just saw Su Ge looking at himself with a smile: "How do you feel? Mr. Drake?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great! Unprecedented! I feel like I have regained my new life." Drake squeezed his fists, his arms danced and excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "Good, then the contract between us is officially reached."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Drake listened to his heart and hurriedly said: "Yes! Teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not follow the promise, waved "You are not qualified to be my student yet, so don't use this title."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Drake suddenly felt a bit depressed, then said: "Okay, Mr. Assassin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger ordered the order: "Next, you will continue to do your own thing, if that few false mysteries If you find you, you don't have to be afraid. You have my mark on you, they don't dare to hurt you. But you should be with them as much as possible to help me monitor their every move."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Drake tempted: "Some fake mysteries are not worthy of your attention?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; "Quiet obedient, good for you." Su Ge said lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drake immediately thought of Suger's powerful means, and hurriedly nodded his head: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded with satisfaction, with Shirley He stood up and said, "Execute your own orders. If you want to enter mystery and wait for the city to shine, I can let you enter this field."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to it, Draketon was very excited and hurriedly said: "We must live up to your expectations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Su Ge left the box and left Excited Drake two bottles of premium wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreek took a sip of his mouth and felt his body, his excitement, and he felt that countless money and beauty had waved to himself. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug two people walked on the deck, and Shirley looked at the deep blue water and said, "You don't seem to have a good impression on him."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "Of course, he is not suitable for being a mystery. Even if he becomes, with a quick mentality, he will quickly lose control and become troublesome." Drake is a typical vested interest, he has no foresight, and he does not understand restraint. Giving such power will only become a scourge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh!? Your concern for the whole human being is beyond my imagination." Shirley looked at him, and the tone didn't know whether it was praise or irony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger put his hands in his trouser pockets and stopped to look at the small island in the distance. "The worldview and morality are hard to change once they are formed. I have changed a lot in my experience over the past few years, but I have judged my words with normal universal values. I am still a good person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I grew up I have received a kind education and can help others to feel happy. If there is not enough ability, I will not feel any guilt. As for the so-called bad guys, I hate them and naturally want to kill them. In fact, you can watch Out, the purpose of killing them many times is not to save a lot of people, just to hate them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley nodded slightly, indicating agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past year and a half, strictly speaking, Su Ge killed more people than she killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did see that when Su Ge killed some bandits and cultists, the corner of his mouth would show a very pleasant smile and seemed to enjoy the process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first time I saw "The Evening Clock in Glen", I have a word that I agree with."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge said profoundly: "At that time, he said to those sinners, "The death of blasphemy is the gospel of the world. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley heard a smile on his lips: "He sees it very thoroughly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Well, the death of some people is indeed a gospel for the whole world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said this, relaxed: "From yesterday When he was peeping at us, I had already tried Drake. His death is also the gospel of the world. He is a typical unstable factor in the world. He is quick and quick, always dreaming, delusional, leading to inner peace. Dirty and distorted. This form of soul is easily exposed to something that is not clean and becomes its carrier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, how are you going to let him die?" Snowley asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked up at the bright sunshine and said, "There is a strong death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge, who has already woven all the roads of Drake, waited for him to embark on this path of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After talking about it, the two people leisurely stopped and stopped on the boat, like a happy couple on a newlywed honeymoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 10 am, two people came to the casino on the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After changing some chips, I played some small games. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people have no interest in gambling. This time, only Shirley wants to feel the atmosphere of the casino. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood by a gambling table and watched the shaking clock of the beautiful dealer’s hand, laughing and laughing and never betting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
