			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quick decision, Su Ge said it was done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred animal beastly monster may be very tricky for ordinary clergy, but for the mysterious level of Su Ge, it is white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the rushing monster, Su Ge’s body tightened and rushed up, and at the moment when the two were about to touch, Su Ge swung a stun, a horrible The vibration is transmitted through the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent vibration made the monster's body momentum suddenly stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge long sword waving, the sword is accompanied by a beautiful sword flower under the moon, directly cut on the neck of the monster full of red hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as the sniper, Su Ge directly launched the ability to vibrate, the fastest, the fastest speed, the whole sword is like a high-speed rotating chainsaw In general, the monster's hard skin is torn open, the body is cut, and the bones are cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪叽! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Su Ge sword standing on the ground slammed the blood of the sword on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpse-separated monster lost all its activity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then after the gaze of Su Ge, the body of the monster gradually turned into a burst of blood red light particles gradually dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was nothing left in the end, even the human body did not, it was like returning to the embrace of the blood goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the premise is that there is no monster left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long sword became a cane, and Su Ge walked silently to the head of the hugely distorted monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, kind person." The twisted monster's head is full of gentle man's voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be heard from the sound. This is a young man with a mild temperament and a good personality on weekdays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster's head didn't change back, but the red-haired eyes had recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly asks: "Is there any last words?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can still talk at this time Having consciousness is because the monster's body has a strong mysterious resonance, which allows the soul that normally dissipates in a normal situation to depend on it for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster turned his eyes slightly and looked at the dark figure of Su Ge’s slenderness in the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a loser, my weak consciousness, weak character surrendered to the animal nature, lost the dignity of the clergy, turned into a sly monster. Goodness People, have I turned my back on the loyalty to the goddess and turned into a fallen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge silenced for a second, calmly replied: "You The determination is worthy of respect, your courage is remembered, your tenderness cares for others, your sacrifice is the contribution to the world, the guardian of your friends and family, you are not a fallen person, you should be buried in a heroic gesture, in people's Admire and enjoy the eternal peace in gratitude."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster is full of gratitude after listening to the soft tone: "Thank you, kind person. Your words let me get Peace, your approval gives me enough courage to face death and blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he turned to look at the sky and murmured: " Goddess, I... Why did it become like this? I... Why became a cleric? ? Why ...... Why the soft moonlight becomes stench of bloody Why ...... "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;? & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; talking, he had no voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stood here silently, without answering. For a long time, Su Ge said calmly: "Because those sinister gods, because of the filthy things you believe in, let your kindness, let your Brave has become useless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, unfortunately, the monster has not heard the sound of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Su Ge’s gaze, a gray soul gradually drifted out of his head, and he looked up at the moon in the sky, his body in the moonlight. Gradually dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge saw this and could not help but create an indescribable anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have this qualification!" Su Ge suddenly snarled loudly against the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he suddenly stepped forward, and the late bell came out to surround the soul, so that the soul he was about to disappear could be preserved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge held the soul in the bell, and took a deep breath to calm down his anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you...thank you for your comfort, thank you for your anger." The weak voice came from afar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned his head and saw the captain’s face lying bloody, and the scary face was grateful and happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sugg walked up to him, only to find that he was blind and his eyes were completely paralyzed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't live, if it's not the psionic power that supports your brain, your brain has now become a paste." Su Ge sounds calm Speaking of a very cruel reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain said peacefully: "I know... I can see my companion waving at me, I can see the smile of Gyor, Mick’s drinking, the carat poison tongue cares about the person...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear’s chest is a bit stuffy when he hears this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the near future, he still looked at the tragedy as a strange observer, without any feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the depth of contact, Su Ge can clearly feel the pain of heartbreaking, the kind of desperate heartbreak, and finally put down With relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People will only care for others who can make themselves emotionally resonate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, these two poor clergymen caused a strong resonance of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, for many years, you are the first person to praise us for these underlying night owls. Your recognition has made me feel calm and yours. Praising for Aibo to be redeemed also gave me comfort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And your anger really makes me happy, because finally someone will be angry for our efforts, cough and cough..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The captain’s mouth choking blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's tone is still calm, calm and scary: "Because you know, so angry. Because you know, it feels worthless for you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain smiled awkwardly: "Oh, you are a kind good person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge silent shake I shook my head and denied it. Unfortunately, the captain could not see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Are you still there?" asked the captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took a deep breath and said, "I am."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can Help me a favor?" asked the captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge succinctly responded: "You said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My home is at 4431 Yaoyang Street Room 221, the bottom of my desk has all the wages I have spent in recent years. Can you give me this money to Aibo’s sister? Her sister wants to take the steam guild and needs a lot of money. His family is at 4, Blade Street. No. 204."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain said, the bloody hand took an old key from his arms and handed it to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squatted for the first time and reached out to pick up the key in the palm of his hand: "Reassure, his sister will be well-fed in this life, I promise ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, kind person, may your path be full of light, away from filthy blood and bad luck."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain said, the whole person's anger quickly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out with a difficult hand and seemed to grab something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long wait, I...come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
