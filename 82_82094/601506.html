			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Su Ge’s show, the ordinary people did not see, but let all the mysterious people who saw it fall into deep shock and awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things swayed in silence, and reached a climax in the rain, and finally settled in the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When many people were shocked, Su Ge was unable to lie in bed at this moment, and he breathed a sigh of relief: "It’s so cool."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the body is weak at this time, the muscles are sore, but Su Ge has a hearty and happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley leaned against the sofa on the side, slender legs on the coffee table, and asked casually: "Show your own knowledge of vibration and the form of weapons, you Not afraid of being discovered by others?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and replied: "The problem is not big. The swordsmanship and the vibration knowledge that I have shown now are no longer a system. In the meantime, it is impossible for any one person to connect these two people together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Shirley thinks a little, surely Su Ge idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surg before the shock is just the transmission of vibration, radiation and defense, it looks more like a mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the origin of knowledge is the same, no one can unite this swordsman who can launch a sword with the former wizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because in this world, one occupation is common sense and iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the cane?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sughaha smiled: "You imagine, I last time Did you use a cane during the battle?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl sneaked and then shouted: “Not too stupid.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last battle of the ancient city, the church in March only knew that Sug had a cane, and in the battle with the clergy, he had barely used his cane. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the cane, it can be deformed, and only the butcher has seen it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Su Ge’s understanding of the butcher, the butcher will never say these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time, Su Ge rehabilitated, and Shirley on the side looked at the tune that Su Ge couldn't understand, preparing for the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of her eccentric interest, she has a lot of eccentric clothes, in the words of Sug, it is the second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She likes sharp corners, likes the tail, likes claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twilight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly nodded in satisfaction with herself in the mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rarely added a dark red to her black dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper body is wearing a very rare black tight-fitting leather coat of this era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leather is very close to the skin, just to her navel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a dark red close-fitting dress inside the leather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dress extends down her waist until she reaches her knee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slender long legs are dressed in dark and delicate stockings, and the feet are wearing high heeled black boots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark hair is hard to be combed into a pair of double ponytails, with two hairpins with devil long horns at the roots of the two ponytails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a V-shaped black mask on the face that blocks the eyes and nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black mask, fair skin, scarlet lips, three huge color differences make her full of seductive temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" Shelly turned and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge has recovered almost now, standing up from the bed and looking at it, suddenly felt a little accelerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she was too tempted to wear, let Su Ge think of the beautiful characters that they can see in the game in their lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Su Ge’s silence, Shirley’s brow wrinkled: “What? Not good?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg then repurchased God and said seriously: "Take this dress three times this evening!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哼哼!" Shelly Suddenly nodded with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood up and took off his clothes, revealing a strong, muscular upper body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will take a shower first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl once again makes a lot of dress up After confirming that there are no problems and problems, sit down satisfactorily and pack the clothes that will be taken out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about your clothes?" Shelly asked the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge arbitrarily said: "My clothes are handled well. Black robe, take Vanas to give me a custom suit, you can come out to activities." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice here is falling, Su Ge’s suitcase opens automatically, the black robe climbs out from the inside, folds up and the black cloth gradually becomes bigger, and finally becomes a About one meter five high, the little man formed by black cloth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the black robe came out, it seemed like a person to move his body. It can be seen from the slightly dithered fabric, it seems very comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hurry up and take your clothes, don't scream in front of me." Sherry said dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the black robe suddenly shook, the whole body smashed, kneeling on the ground and climbing to the side of the box, carefully holding the su The clothes are placed on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black robes are the holy grail of the Holy Grail of the Soul, and they have been fully surrendered before Sug to the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge, who holds the Holy Grail of the Soul, is simply the master who created it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole evening, there are very few people outside, because everyone is carefully preparing their evening costumes and makeup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bathed Sug walked over to tidy up his hair, shave his beard, and put on his clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s clothes have no flower heads, just a suit that looks very slim and fit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a neat white shirt, but there is no bow tie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The style of the suit has been slightly adjusted, making it easier for Su Ge’s strenuous exercise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a black leather jazz cap on his head, Sug took a blindfold similar to Shirley, and then put on a black robe for the first time on the boat. An elegant and neat gentleman appeared like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a hand, the cane leaning against the side automatically flew into the hands of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You need to change your own line." Su Ge said, the black glove was holding the cane, and the hand was stunned by the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire silver-gray palm turned into a deep blue, with a faint starlight on the top, very beautiful and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although it's too arrogant, it's not bad." Su Ge looked at the new shape of the cane and nodded with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of the Holy Grail is not only to control the soul, after reaching a certain tacit understanding, Su Ge can use the Holy Grail to see through the perspective of the soul. thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can be understood as a substantial increase in the soul of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of the Holy Grail of Soul, Su Ge knows that there are a total of twenty forms of this Great God's Declaration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cane, the long sword, the chain sword, the umbrella, and the chain are only basic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
