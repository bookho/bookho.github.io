			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the north of Guinness, heading to the Misty Mountains is the official road leading to the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road is very smooth, but Su Ge does not go all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very aware of the dangers there, and there is already enough foundation on his side. There is no substantive difference between going to one day and going to the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge was sitting in the carriage and looking at a book in the Royal Library. There is a section inside that details the city of the disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the book was leaving, Vanas gave Elena to him, and on the key pages, he also placed a red maple leaf bookmark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bookmark also carries the unique fragrance of Vanas, with a special fragrance blended with black mandala and sage, Su Ge likes this very much. taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incense is a gift that Master Mill gave to her when Vanas was born. This fragrance is very special, refreshing and refreshing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-term use can even make people highly resistant to drugs and anesthetics, which is very important for women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas took this special pill from an early age, so that this aroma has been integrated into her body and has become a constant fragrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it true that all the women in the Queen are arrogant?" Sug smiled and bookmarked the other pages, looking at the introduction of the city of the disaster. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of disaster, the mysterious organization that emerged from an unknown time, people don’t know where the city of disaster is, nor what the city of the disaster is like, the so-called The city of disasters is a unilateral cognition of people, and the source of the name is a kind of monster walking in the human world - a hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the record, the first hunter was discovered by people about 3,000 years ago. At that time they were not called hunters, they were called bloodsuckers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is that the humanoid monsters are all black blood, full of filth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They usually wear a coat made of animal fur, wearing pure metal armor inside. A prototype closed helmet on the head with a replaceable triangular metal mask on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attire has not been replaced since they appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black blood is as thick as oil, without any smell, but when it is seen, it will instinctively feel a sense of unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like going out to see the crow, deep into the human instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did the hunter appear? No one knows so far, and their purpose is not clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, what is certain is that the hunters have a certain amount of wisdom. Every time they appear, they have a very clear purpose, and even use lassos and traps to capture the enemy. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main goal of their initial goal is to capture certain species of rare animals, including Yalong, Golden Retriever and other species that have been passed down from ancient times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the initials did not attract much attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time their attention began to be placed on humans, they never carried out mass killings, creating huge destruction events, but Like the quiet traffickers, they appear silently, taking the target away and killing all witnesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action is very secretive and swift. According to expert statistics, 90% of their actions are not known and witnessed by outsiders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the disappearance of more and more people, and the missing are mysterious people with good qualifications, even they have taken away a sacred woman of a glorious church The figure of the Archbishop of the Five March Church, which suddenly caused anger among many large organizations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time it represents disaster and chaos, like an invisible hunter of urban legends, since then, the name of the hunter has been widely circulated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, from that time on, the Fortress began to track the hunters as their primary goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, with the mysterious growth of people, people began to counterattack and arrest the hunters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, people discovered more of these hunters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, they are different from normal people, and there are three eyes behind the metal mask. There are even four eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is certain that the more hunters in the eye, the stronger the hunter will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lowest level of three-eyed hunters has the same overall combat power and expertise, and the four-eye hunter is already a master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over time, the exposure of hunters has increased, and people have learned more about them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have a headquarters similar to the city, and they will bring the people away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every occurrence is to bring the goal back for the first purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They rarely take the initiative to kill the target, giving priority to living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunted hunter who was killed will suddenly disappear, and human beings will not be able to get the body of the hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The catastrophic hunter who died will seem to be repaired and cured, and will appear again later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence is that a mysterious person is impressed by his own psionic power on a hunter's arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunter was killed afterwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the last three months, when another mysterious person broke the arm of a hunter's arm, he witnessed the pattern and reported it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And until now, people still don’t know how the hunter happened, how it disappeared, and where the so-called disaster city is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, according to analysis by major organizations, the city of disasters has not caused much problems so far, but they are likely to be planning something horrible, which may cause the world. The big event of sexual disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to incomplete statistics, they have taken away at least one million mysterious people for thousands of years, and these mysterious people are used for what they do, and where the will is, people do not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, no matter where the hunter strikes occur, it should be regarded as the highest priority. Everyone should abandon some grievances, give priority to killing all the hunters, don’t let It takes away anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The textual introduction ends here, followed by exquisite black and white paintings of several hunters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks no different from humans, but wearing armor of steel and fur, metal armor, animal skin outside, joints with animal skin, head The helmet looks like a vertical rugby, and it looks like a medieval Nordic Viking warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three holes on the metal mask represent the three-eye hunter, and the four holes represent the four-eye hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the eyes?" Su Ge looked down at the very delicate drawing inside and fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is relatively popular information. For many years, the intelligence of the hunter should not only be so. I don't know what information is there from Father Water and Master Gerlos. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contemplation, Hills’s voice came: "Adult, there is a team behind us that is speeding up and approaching us."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!?" Su Ge's eyebrows pick one, and the night bells spread. After <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, Suger felt that a speeding fleet was approaching quickly about 40 meters behind the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a total of five carriages in the team, which is very fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two people sitting in the leading carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After subtle perception, Su Ge smiled: "No need to be nervous, it is my friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about a minute, with a hoof of galloping, a bright brown carriage caught up with Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the window opened, Moore smiled and said: "The action of Bishop Sotos is really fast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and spread the hand: "No way, order More urgent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge closed the book: "Is there any interest to come over and talk?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course!" Moore seems to be doing this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two teams of carriages stopped at the same time, and the people on both sides knew each other and temporarily formed a team of peers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore was alone in the car of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the bishop bring such a person this time?" Moore was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger said casually: "We are just the first troops, they will be in the field, and there will be large units behind."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore’s eyes flashed a glimmer of light: “What do the bishops think about this incident?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t know the true and false Let's take a look at it in the past!" Su Ge said casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Murh laughed and said: "I didn't expect the bishop to be a confused master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "A few times in life, it's hard to be confused, it's hard to be confused!" Su Ge sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Moore took the initiative to find himself, there is something to ask for himself, so Su Ge just keeps on being confused, and wait for him to speak first, Su Ge will master The initiative. Moore smiled and said: "I am not a businessman, nor a politician. I can only be regarded as a half-police. So I prefer to go straight, the bishop does not want too." I’m worried.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard that he wouldn’t talk to him and asked: “Is there anything that the captain is so hurried to come over?” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore’s eyes flashed with deep radiance: “Don’t you want to know why the things in the Misty Mountains suddenly spread throughout the mysterious world?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
