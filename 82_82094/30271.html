			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you waved with your cane, Su Ge felt extra handy, and the metal body hit the person, and it would cause severe pain without fracture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that during the industrial revolution, the civilized cane in the hands of gentlemen was not used to support the body, but to defend themselves. This sentence is really true. Not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put the cane down, Su Ge will take off his dirty body shirt and underwear, take a bath towel and walk towards the bathroom . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s only six o'clock, Winnie and Black are still not awake, go take a shower first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is very familiar with the life habits of his younger siblings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the bathroom is relatively narrow, and there is no room for two people standing at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lock the door, Su Ge did not open the gas stove to boil water, lying directly in the cold water of only 4 degrees, a comfortable look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the canvas ceiling, Suge closed his eyes and sorted out Suger Sotos’s memories of occultism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's occultal knowledge is mostly taught by his own undead mentors, and some are self-exploring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mystery really exists in this world, and the average person knows a little more. Because the church watchers and the demon hunters are typical mysterious products." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But people are very afraid of mystery, because after entering the mystery, it is not only a torture of the spirit, but also has a huge danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The danger comes from two aspects. The first is the spirit. The core of entering the mystery is the attribute that people are called "spiritual". The ordinary person's vision is 0, can't see any Supernatural things. But because of the growth of knowledge and the association and sorting of some strange events, the visual acuity will increase. The higher the spiritual vision, the more the mysterious things can be understood. Enhance vision and knowledge, but with the risk is to see some horrible phenomena and incomprehensible existence. Those things that are only seen will make people feel fearful, and if they have bad psychological quality, they will go crazy directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Su Getu said: "Isn't this the system of the Cthulhu mythology? No wonder people don't care about the extraordinary power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The myth of Cthulhu, Su Ge suddenly found some problems with his name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug Sotos...Yug Sotos, my name and the god of the three gods are only one word missing, which is not What's the problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thought is just a thought, Su Ge will pull the mind back to continue to deal with memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mental torture is a physical danger. The March goddess divides ordinary humans and mysterious monsters in order to protect human beings. The core theory is: I don't know who is fearless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Based on this theory, as long as people can't see those mysterious monsters, then those mysterious monsters will not actively attack ordinary people. But if you see the monsters and know them, then they will also notice you and attack afterwards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course this theory Not for all mysterious monsters, only for the Yi people from the abyss, and those mysterious monsters with artificial monsters and local monster variations can still actively attack humans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Spiritual!" With this attribute in mind, Su Ge retrieves his own vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attribute is very interesting. People's perception of the vision is the same as instinct, and can be viewed directly through the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The range of visual values ​​is from 0 to 99. The normal human range of vision is 0-5, and my current vision has 9 points, already Out of the normal safety range."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking time has come to half past six, Su Ge got up and wiped the body and then let the water drop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normal people may not bathe with water of this temperature in the winter, and he is afraid that his brother and sister will have unnecessary doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Su Ge began preparing breakfast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of the world's Suger Sotos or Su Ge, they are familiar with cooking because their parents leave early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, due to the difference between Chinese and Western cultures, the meat buns and small meat porridge that Su Ge wanted to eat could not be eaten here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that can be eaten is the heated gray bread, the thick fish sauce and the mashed potatoes with no taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The diet here is really hot!" Standing in the kitchen, Su Ge sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you find a stable job in the future, you should improve your food and let the two little guys see what is the real breakfast!" Su Ge’s heart Determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next to the stove, the second squatted on the ground, watching his master stick his tongue out and shake his tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the look of this guy’s eagerness, Su Ge’s heart suddenly felt a little unbearable, so he gave him the last two bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the future, this is not a three-mouth, it is four."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 in the morning Point, the two brothers who just got up saw the breakfast prepared at the table suddenly stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s newspaper in his hand smiled and said, “Go wash, eat later.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Seeing the soft smile of Su Ge, the two sisters were happy at the bottom of their hearts, because the warm big brother who was familiar with him was finally back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down and looking at the newspaper, Sug saw yesterday’s headline with two dangerous witches sneaking into Bain, the church’s hunter and the night People are actively arresting and letting the citizens they see actively provide intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Witch? A little bit of meaning." Su Ge retrieved the memory of the witch, and his expression was full of interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witches of this world are similar to the witches of the Middle Ages. Unlike the witches, each of these witches has a powerful mysterious power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious power of the rumor comes from the inheritance of the devil. The mysterious power of the witch is very easy to get out of control. Every time it loses control, it will become a monster with horror and strangeness, causing a lot of losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, at the end of the third dynasty of Calding, about 5,000 years ago, the witch was completely positioned and hunt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it really the power of the devil?" Su Ge was full of doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a new era, there are morals, qualities, cultures, and ideals. There are four young people. Although Su Ge is not an atheist, he still has to be more aboriginal than here. It is objective and will not be bound by folklore and customs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue to look down and continue to look down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1,400 kinds of cults!?" Seeing this number, Su Ge's dark brow picks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the official survey data of the Empire. As of November 23, 7844, a total of 1421 cults were found throughout the mainland, including the world war, subversion. Seventeen large cults in a country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a pros and cons to the existence of a real god! The world has clearly reached a heinous level in science and technology, but still because of faith. Or the desire is easily brainwashed into a fanatical cult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After fifteen minutes, Winnie and Black wash the sip at the dinner table before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, brother. We will go to the police station for a while. We have reported the case of your disappearance. Since you are back, you have to go through the case." Black remembered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and said, "This is my own way. When you have finished eating, go to school. Don't continue to take time off."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of Su Ge’s disappearance, the two have already taken two days off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people looked back to normal, a reliable brother, nodded cheerfully, promised to come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
