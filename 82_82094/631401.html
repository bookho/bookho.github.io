			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the horror of Ieta, the shadow demon that scares countless people disappears into the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a 60-point vision, you can see that the shadow demon is a truly advanced demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are born with horrific talents that can be hidden in any shadow, even in the shadows of humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, none of the humans entangled in the shadow demons escaped the fate of being killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it’s everyone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the shadow demon, which has long been considered a dead god by people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta was sitting on the ground at this time, and the whole body was already sweated, and the makeup on his face was spent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, her spiritual vision has risen four points, and at the same time she saw two legendary high demons, even though she almost died in her In the hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This horrible experience scared her with a trembling and physical weakness, especially when she was just caught by the shadow demon, she even forgot all the knowledge, forgot How to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because for the ordinary mystery, the shadow demon is death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is your relationship with \b Assassin?" The voice of the young people came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta has gathered all his spirits, first stabilizes his inner fears, and takes a deep breath and says: "Mr. Assassin is good to me, I am ready to become His subordinates."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, she looked up at this refined, sound-sounding youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man said with a smile: "You have to be sincere and honored because you have a good master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咕噜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Ieta heard this breath, his heart was completely overwhelmed by shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This horrible big man is so high on that one? And it seems that the relationship between the two people seems very good! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t see through Su Ge’s means, not quite sure about the height of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at this moment, she is very aware of how powerful this horror exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free summoning and enslaving the devil, the shadow demon, the higher demon, taming like a pet, this powerful existence is beyond her imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystery has a lot of summoning, and there are many female warlocks, she knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk of summoning spells is enormous, and summoning and slavery are two different things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of summoning does not mean that you can be enslaved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to what she knows, she can summon the existence of these two higher demons, at least the horror of the lord, and actually go to the abyss trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because only the lord who can make the knowledge completely independent, can remotely control the active knowledge on both sides without restriction, and carry out advanced summoning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, independent knowledge must be placed in the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is just a call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to historical records, if you want to completely enslave the horrible existence of the shadow demon, then you need the dominator level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the dominator who has absolute control over knowledge can enslave this advanced demon at will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dominator!!!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think of this, Iyeta feels that she just Restoring some of the reasoning again appeared panic and messy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her only expert, the mystery of the dominator level is farther away than the Pope of the March church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope can still see from the report, and the dominator is truly out of the powerful existence of the human world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the dominator is on the same level..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta brain is blank at this time, my mind Only one sentence in the process is constantly echoing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence was what Albert said before her: "He is who I can't say, I can only say that what he said is true." And his real power is far beyond the limits of your imagination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beyond the limits of my imagination..." Iyeta feels his brain It’s about to explode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the existence of Su Ge has indeed broken through the limits of her imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, calm down." The soft and pleasant voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta was able to return to God and suddenly found himself sitting in a clean hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clothes that have been soaked in sweat have been taken off, and they are wearing loose and dry pajamas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible young man is opposite himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked with a sluggish sentence: "How do I get here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You were in fear, the whole person was completely stupid, so I took you to the place where I lived." The youth looks very chic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, I am the clothes that Xiaosha will help you change, I haven't seen it." The youth continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta nodded dullly, then mechanically asked: "Who is Xiaosha?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You have seen, I can only bring her a woman at any time." The young man said, turned and handed over a cup of coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta runs his dry brain and thinks about it, immediately thinking of the vicious charm of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, she almost did not catch the coffee handed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be so afraid, since you are his servant, then I have no malice against you, and I don't intend to kill you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man said, by the way, said: "My name is Guju, a good friend of your future master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Good...friends..." Ieta still feels a little trembling, but tries to get through the things that have just happened. At this time, I can barely calm myself down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take a sip of coffee and calm down in peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time has passed ten minutes. After Ieta finished drinking the coffee, he said with respect and respect: "Thank you, thank you for your understanding."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient sense of the state is cool and refreshing: "Nothing, after all, it is a friend, in our hometown, it is very personal. There is a saying that is good, dog watching Master. Haha, although it is not appropriate, but it probably means this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta did not feel any discomfort, because she is very clear, here In front of one, there is no difference between himself and a dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you recognize me and Mr. Assassin?" Iyeta respectfully asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient sense said casually: "You have a strong impression of his body. You should have been sheltered before."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta immediately thought of the sacred, the bell that calmed down, and the fog of peace, nodded and said, "Well, we have been attacked by the evil spirits on board before." Mr. Assass has sheltered everyone on the boat through the bells and fog, and we are spared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient feelings listened and laughed: "Sure enough? , is a nosy person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta looked at the free and easy feelings, the inner fear and fear completely subsided, the stiff thoughts returned to normal, Intellectuality and correctness returned to her face again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
