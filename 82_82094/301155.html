			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the palace, Mil took a circle with Su Ge, and did not find the one-faced rat. The last two stood under one opened cover. At the nozzle, make sure that this thing comes in and out through the sewer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not a good thing to get too big." Sug squatted down and said that this can be inserted into the drain of a person’s head, half jokingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill squats down and wants to find some useful clues, such as the hair of a human face rat, but unfortunately not found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This problem is a bit of a hassle, and it doesn't matter if you can detect this particular Yi, even if it can be detected, the modification time needs at least two Month." Mill stood up and his brow wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugner’s cane knocked on the drain and asked: “This can be sent to guard the next one. If you can’t see it, you can set some physics made of mysterious materials. The nature of the institution?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill took a look at Su Ge: "You see that you are an architectural idiot, the whole castle is so big, the sewer is intricate, and not If you can't get in, even if you can get in, do you think this is realistic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s face is innocent: "I am helping you." Exploring ideas, masters.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be things that he can’t control. At this time, Mill is a little annoyed: “I don’t have time to listen to your humorous jokes now. This matter must be resolved as soon as possible, otherwise the trouble will be big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked around and took his eyes back: "If there is no guarantee that this thing will come in from where , then make sure that Connor is safe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mil is silent, then click "This is the only way to do this. I need to think of it as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will contact my people at night to see if he has any means. Su Ge said casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your person? Can he get into the sewer?" Mill asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge thought with a smile: "Don't say, he can really get into the sewer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After determining that the problem of human face invasion could not be solved, Mill Connor, who is undergoing surgery, has strengthened protection and even sent his own left and right hands, the most desirable apprentice: Marvel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connor’s surgery lasted for four hours, and with the efforts of five doctors and six nurses, he finally filled most of his chest and abdominal cavity. It was taken out of the body, and then a drainage tube was inserted into his ribs and abdomen to slowly guide the remaining fluid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the lungs were simply treated, the interrupted intestines were re-sewed, and the Royal Blood Bank was used to give him enough blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, he lost too much blood before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at Connor with two tubes in his body, Su Ge’s heart missed the world’s top medical facilities and blood therapy techniques of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Su Ge and Hills had a meal of the most luxurious and sophisticated dinner in this life under the hospitality of Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many people to dinner, the Su Ge and the Vanas three, a total of six people, starting dinner with four attendants and six maids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the table with white lace gauze and nanmu wood, the first vegetable salad with cabbage, tomatoes and apples was added, and white vinegar was added. Sweet and sour. After a simple meal, the first dish is the appetizing broth cooked by the white bear, and the second, third and fourth dishes are the unique game: black meat elk roast, roasted golden-skin pig and perfectly cooked. Purple squid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dinner, there are desserts, foods carved with almond paste, waffles, cakes and fresh fruits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This meal gives Sug a lot of emotion. On the one hand, the taste of these foods is really delicious, and the second is the whole meal, elegant The noble Vanas gave a low-level fart to the aristocratic dining etiquette class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The posture of eating, the gesture of holding a knife and fork, the movement of the mouth, the rhythm of talking and eating, etc., watching the elegant and calm look of others Su Ge looked down at himself and felt that he was completely compared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After this time, I must study and study in this area. After the church has grown stronger, it will definitely be used!" Su Ge secretly vowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Vanas did not have a disgust and look down on the way and attitude of Su Ge’s very temperament and taste. On the contrary, she confirmed this At the time, the Pope’s special dining habits developed specifically for the Church of the Late Bells, I also secretly planned to ask about Hills in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a rich and tedious dinner, Su Ge is very fragrant, but not full, and at the same time eating very tired, both mentally and physically . Because the entire meal time is enough to reach an hour and a half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, Hills did not pay attention to that much, eating the mouth of the mouth, the little belly was slightly drummed up, a look of satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the lavish dinner, prepare to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dream, Su Ge first used his power to summon Randall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall situation here is very suitable for Randall's play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Hills, Randall has been in the bloody holy pool for almost two months, and the time he agreed with Hills before entering is Forty days or so, it is now forty-four days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge estimates that he should be out, so he is now calling directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After summoning, Su Ge turned his body into a form of ordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has decided that his body will not show up for a long time in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liwei is enough. Too frequent appearances and communication with ordinary people are against the force of being a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was about to step out of the main hall, Su Ge made three things in the corner of the main hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dilapidated book, a skull burning with a green flame, and a black glove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
