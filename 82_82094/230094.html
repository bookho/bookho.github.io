			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the four ghouls are about to approach Su Ge, they hear a heavy bell at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And it’s the bell!?" The leading ghoul Raz heard some caution in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time he was attracted to Su Ge through his mental strength, his mental strength was completely cut off after hearing the bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The kind of sharp edge has no effect on our body!" According to previous experience, Raz determined that the bell only had an effect on the psionic power. Strong body is ineffective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the next second, Raz found himself miscalculated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A muffled sound, the four ghouls felt their heads hit a steel door at the same time, and the violent impact made the four ghosts dizzy. The violent rebound force on them simultaneously stabilizes them in two steps to stabilize the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What a ghost thing!" Raz held his head and his heart was full of surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side, Su Ge rushed out as the four arrows stalked as the four ghouls bounced back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time as the rushing, the purifying agent in the hand is wiped on the cane, ready to be killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of killing is the ghoul on the left side of his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skinny ghoul licked his dizzy head and found that the human had come to himself when he recovered, but actually took the old cane Sting to your body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Idiot! Even if there is a purifying agent? This kind of junk weapon also wants to break my resistant skin!?" The ghoul is full of confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he didn’t even dodge, the huge claws grabbed Su Ge’s head and prepared to hurt him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the next second...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dilapidated palm has an inexplicable sharpness that actually pierces the ghoul's chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent pain and accidents made the ghoul's attack suddenly stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s head tilted back slightly, avoiding the stiff blow, then tightening the cane and screwing it, the muscles of the arm squirmed A huge force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood splattered, the ghouls stared at the constantly shaking sky, and the heart had serious doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, what's wrong with this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plop, when his body falls, Instinctively turned around and found that my body was completely cut off from the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he caught his eye, and there was a sharp sword stained with his own blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the long sword?" This is the last thought of the ghoul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Sug turned his head and looked at the other three ghouls, faintly said: "Sorry, I hate ugly things, the hand Heavier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, the sword in his hand is a smashing place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sun, the long sword that was deformed by the cane flashed cold and cold, and it only gave a sharp eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Variable weapons, but also have such a high mysterious compatibility. Can not see, this cane is actually a mysterious costume." Raz changed his face at this time Dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger once again applied the purifying agent to the sword and looked at the three ghouls: "So, three gentlemen, there is no interest in continuing you." The determination?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge walked calmly toward the three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raz gave a look to his companions, and the three people scattered in three directions gathered in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A district apprentice apprentice, do you really think that you are invincible?" Raz three people looked awkward, and then the whole body shook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that when the body shakes, their rotten skin gradually fades, and the body appears to have a gram similar to the stratum corneum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resistant Keke." Su Ge flashed a hint of dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistant Ake is an upgraded version of resistant skin. This is the versatile ability of the ghoul. This layer of gram is five times more defensive than usual and can last forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the price is that after the resistance is turned on, they cannot recover the human form within three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are brave enough, not afraid of being annihilated by other members of the church?" Su Ge asked, clenching his hilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raz cracked his mouth and smiled: "It depends on how many clergy there are in the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge suddenly sinks in his heart, and a terrible thought rises in his mind uncontrollably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Opportunity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the three people of Raz crossed over almost one breath. Five meters away, came to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge once again used the night bell to protect and defend, while the long sword in his hand was against the nest and his arms were tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of the three people gathered together is very huge. After encountering the night bell again, the three people joined forces and broke through in a second. This sound shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this second, Su Ge’s body was tense, and the long sword that the left hand held back suddenly slammed forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people are less than two meters in front of Su Ge...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not good!" Raz suddenly felt wrong. The body that had rushed forward stopped and grabbed his right companion and jumped back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two have just retreated, and a huge steel shackle is surrounded by the whistling wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around a circle, one locks the remaining ghoul that has not reacted to the far right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp blade gradually tightened, and the sharp blade of the cockroaches tore his resistance gram in less than three seconds under great pressure and cut into the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harsh screams suddenly sounded, letting Raz and another ghoul hear the fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s arm, numerous cutting blades cut the ghoul’s body, instantly tearing his body muscles completely, chest, ribs, heart, lungs The department is completely exposed to the air and can't live without it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the gaze of Raz, the unfolding chain sword resumed the growth of the sword in the incompetent mourning of the ghoul, and there was still a lot of flesh and blood on the top. abnormal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is still calm, and some disgusted the smashed meat on the sword, continue to move forward: "What do you think of the church's purple moon activist?" The rookie intern who just graduated from the school? Or the new recruit who just joined the army?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the advancement of Su Ge, the two men stepped back cautiously, four Eyes staring at the weapon in the hands of Su Ge, alert to the apex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! What the hell is this guy? This ability, this weapon, and the intelligence is completely two people!" Constant cursing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do?" another ghoul asked in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Withdrawal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raz snorted and both turned and ran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Want to run!?" Su Ge’s eyes slammed, and when he was rushing forward, he took the moon from the arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
