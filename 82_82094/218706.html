			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The savage here seems to be very open, just find a stone to sit down and knock on his head: "I listened to the bells of the church for eighty years." So I know that the bells with this special ability are definitely not in the Church of the Holy Blood. If you are still a low-level cleric, you have this special ability. Are you supposed to be sent by other organizations?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s heart jumped, did not answer, whispered: “Who are you? You should be a mysterious master of at least master level, lurking here wanting What are you doing?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The savage smiled: “Don’t be nervous, I’m not malicious to you. Oh, yes. My name is Luke. As for the last name, it’s temporary. I won't tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stared at him more and more suspiciously, tempted and asked: "Have you been a church of the Holy Blood?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, the Savage Convergence Smile is immersed in contemplation. After ten seconds, the Savage looks up and says, "Strictly come. I am still a member of the Church of the Holy Blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not follow his words and asked: "I didn't feel it in you." Hostility, then can I leave here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke looked at the second side of Su Ge: "Of course, I just said, I am right You are not malicious, but you are very grateful to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge gave a little peace of mind and immediately replied: "Then I will take a step forward. We will see you later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you turn around, leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be so anxious to go! Young man, our days don't seem to be finished yet." Suddenly Sug saw a strong bloody smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sud’s skin shuddered, and the steps that were taken suddenly became unable to fall in midair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗷呜!!" Erha at this time the body's hair gradually erected, and the sound of the wind surrounded its body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the bloody smell suddenly disappeared, Luke’s hearty smile came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little guy, I don't know your name yet," Luke asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Geqiang endured the trembling in his heart: "You can call me Su Ge, as for the surname, I can't tell you for the time being."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since this horrible guy hasn't killed me now, it means that there is a possibility of trading between us. He was crazy before, and returned to normal under my late bells. It is very likely that if you can't hear the night clock for a long time, he may return to that embarrassing state. From this perspective, this guy will never pose a threat to my life."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Sugg’s answer, Luke didn’t care, and pulled out the red hair on his body: “This feeling of long hair is really bad.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, people are not beasts." Su Ge replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence seems to touch him, and Luke is once again immersed in contemplation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Same as last time, and in the past ten seconds, Luke asked Su Ge: "How do you know that people are not beasts?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear did not answer this. Because he thought of the animal nature of mankind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do we make a deal?" Luke raised the issue of Su Ge's concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s quiet voice: “You said.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’ve already I wandered here for two years, and although I avoided a lot of things, it made me feel bored. The timing of your appearance is very good, the most important thing is that your bell can suppress my animal nature. Then it is very simple. We can cooperate for a long time, you help me to suppress the animal nature, and I can make you stand more stable in the Holy See, climb faster, and hide your identity more concealed."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg did not rush to promise after listening. After experiencing conversations with Barton and Adeline, he is now much more stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stared at him and said: "The basis of cooperation is mutual trust. You don't give me any trust now. Who knows what you will do after I help you? I? After all, my life is now in your hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke’s dark eyes flashed a touch of blood red, and the tone was cold. “Since I know that my life is in my hands, I dare to talk about the conditions? Young purple moonwalker.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge’s tone and attitude were very tough at this time, and he did not fear the counterattack: “Looking out, you are a very decisive person. Then I will tell you directly. If you want to kill I, let's kill it. And don't say that no one has helped you to suppress the animal nature since then. Believe it or not, at the moment of my death, you will face the horrible existence that you can't face in the poor!?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Luke’s face flashed a dignified: “What do you mean?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serving the supreme and supreme, my devout faith is protected by my Lord's faith. This ghost wolf is the gift that my Lord has given me. I can say that one of my apostles in this world is in me. When my life is threatened, I anger my Lord. I can ask my Lord to come directly to my body. You are really strong. Is it that you have the courage to face the gods of "He"!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke stared at Su Ge: "The flow rate of this guy has no blood." Change, the speed of the heartbeat has not changed, he is not lying!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he seems to find something, close his eyes and feel it, suddenly, he In the blood of Su Ge, he felt an indescribable cold and his soul could almost freeze his soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His heart is actually this thing!" Luke jumped in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Su Ge is quietly thinking about how to give this panic to the circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, he does not have the ability to pull into the dream, if not into the dream, that god is a waste! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Luke made a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha! A little bit interesting! A little bit interesting!" Luke smiled very happy and seemed to see something interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squinted and asked, "You don't believe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke shook his head, Smile and hehe: "I believe, let's talk about each other's situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
