			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Luke’s departure, Sugert’s chin fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complexity of the whole world is beyond his imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The world is really different from the world of fiction. The various systems are complicated by the development of various cultural civilizations. There is no clear standard. You can't use them. The same system? For example, the Emperor Dou Zong..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand up and walk in the Kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Lord of the Storm, also has the name of hunter hunting, also with a long gun, but also control the storm... But how do I feel this guy and I are not all the way God, or is it a completely different existence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge thought in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are many similarities, Su Ge has an intuition as a god. This storm Lord should have no relationship with himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The elves have been put down first, just after the inspiration, I need to sort out the more important things."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one can escape the catastrophe of civilization, the world has been shattered 20,000 years ago, when the entire human being was controlled by the horrible evil spirits, and in a dream became a slave to the ancient evil spirits. Now that the evil spirits are about to wake up again, if we want to survive in this desperate world, we can only enter the ideal township far from the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is The first sentence he heard when he met Lance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two thousand years ago...this time node... seems to be the second coming of the night." Suger seems to have grasped the important message. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The era seems to be exactly the era of "The Stars Travels", human science and technology developed rapidly, but for some reason, the entire civilization was destroyed. Its destruction The speed is like the world is dying overnight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait... overnight... when the stars are right... the god of sleep Cthulhu..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Su Ge’s brain was like being over-powered. The body suddenly shuddered and his eyes widened: “Is it the second night that was caused by Cthulhu!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, his mind suddenly remembered the "Three Translations of the Night Before the Creation" that I saw in Emilia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second sentence is: The goddess opened the chaos, and they ended the second night, giving people wisdom and reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wisdom and reason... If the awakening of Cthulhu is to cover the whole world in a dream, all the technology is deserted, people are caught in madness and chaos After that, the goddess repelled Cthulhu as the master of the world, ending the last night, restarting the world, and people completely separated from the technological world. From then on, the original mysterious era."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge’s heart suddenly became clear, and then the body instantly disappeared to restore the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing everything through the thoughts of the gods, Su Ge found that his speculation did not have any logical errors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legend of the Elf Order, the record of the Star Trek, the translation of the three eternal nights of the creation, the modern weapon of the deep dive, and the Govinth The phone found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five important and seemingly unrelated clues are now fully complementary here, without any sense of disobedience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like five pieces of puzzles perfectly fit together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on the throne, Su Ge looked up slightly at the top of his head: "The second night of the mystery is a part of the solution. So the first time What happened to Everlasting? Is Byron the Great dead or alive? Whose bodies in the old dreams of the ancient city, and who are the seven men in armor?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The more he digs out the truth, Su Ge has found more mysteries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The most important thing is, what era is the end of the gods? It seems that the mythology recorded in the mysterious history book is definitely not the age before the four dynasties. So Yuge ·What did Sotos do? Why is the god of the three gods clinging to the world? Yugostos left the hunter, and the gauze Nicholas left Shirley, Nayilatotip directly sent His own incarnation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time I think about it, even the god Su Ge has no clue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reverting to human form, Su Ge did not leave the Kingdom of God, but walked outside the shrine and thought about the clues on hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You seem to be upset." Some old voices sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked up and saw Ron, who saw the soul form, watching himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sighed: "Yeah, there are a lot of things that you can’t figure out, but it’s there, you can’t help but think.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron’s golden eyes looked at Sue for a few seconds, then suddenly smiled: “I saw myself in your eyes when you were young.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? When you were young, why are you so eager for the history of the past?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron as a super monk with 88 points of vision, what he has experienced in his life, what he sees is legendary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't have your heart, I was only eager for more knowledge and truth." Ron shook his head and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the Bain City incident, Ron had already stated his goal. He only wanted to pull down the gods that were above the heights to prove the possibility of humanity. Sex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge agrees with his ambitions, but does not agree with his original means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are too many scattered news, but I can't connect them together to find out the truth. It feels bad." Su Ge Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron calmly explained: "There is a certain cause and effect between all mysteries. It is not like the relationship of ordinary people, I have seen some people. After that, I won’t see the second time in my life, and I will say the second time. Mystery is not accidental, only inevitable. They are discovered by you and are known to you, then there must be a certain connection. Maybe some people, It may also be some knowledge, more likely to be certain identities, or powers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this Su Ge’s heart suddenly, Ron said that he suddenly found some clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron continued: "It took me thirty years to find the hymn of the giant worm, and the first one is related to this book. The clue is that when I was 12 years old, I was working in a pub and heard the name mentioned by chance when two mysterious people passed by. When I grew up and entered mystery, I found that I always touched. To a lot of things that seem to have nothing to do with each other, it looks very messy. After I made up my mind, I sorted out and investigated through a year, and finally found that these seemingly irrelevant news and clues eventually point to The giant worm. At that moment, I thought of the vocabulary I heard when I was a child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge was the first time to listen to Ron telling his past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to this, Su Ge felt that he had caught something important and said to Ron’s righteous color: “Thank you for your valuable reminders and suggestions. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron smiled and said with a sigh in his eyes: "I deviated from the way of being in the process of moving forward, and my mouth was vocal for humanity, but I have made countless inhuman things. This is my sin and the best way to learn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, Ron’s expression became solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can feel the purity and firmness of your heart. I hope that you can always remember your identity as a human being and remember your original heart. Only then, After you reach a certain height, when you look back, you will find yourself with a clear conscience, and you have not distorted your will and form as a person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Nodded hard: "I will always remember."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron smiled happily and said to the direction of the shrine: "I always think that I am It is a very proud thing for human beings, and the great god is certainly desirable. But that form is destined to be impossible for human beings. If it is, is it human?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell to Ron, Su Ge is a lot easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron’s thoughts, Ron’s experience is critical to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old city old dreams, seven armor warriors, Cthulhu... Everything points to the dream. So there is news about dreams, have I fallen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, Su Ge suddenly thought of someone who was about to be forgotten by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the first contact with the Grail document, he was brought into the old city’s old dream and saw the seven warriors, when he was discovered, to be killed, An old man saved himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person is very powerful and seems to have experienced countless years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He claims to be old Weiss. (See Chapter 0291 for details)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He can freely shuttle dreams, even save people in the world of horrible old dreams, and know the clock people... Now I think he is definitely not a lord. The long-lasting atmosphere is definitely not something that ordinary people can achieve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about what Luke said, Su The face is dignified: "Is that kind of existence, is it immortal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about the words that Old Weiss said at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said that he had a good night's sleep and then saved me. That means he can't have it in some aspects of his dreams. The powerful ability to reach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So who is this old Weiss? Why did he save me??"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After thinking about it, Su Ge couldn’t figure out how to return to his own body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the thinking of the gods, Su Ge instantly figured it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a dreamland, it should be the place where he lives. When I first arrived in the dreamland, I killed two months of beasts, leaving the night bell. The fluctuations, it is very likely that he has noticed me at that time." Su Ge suddenly thought. (0265) <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All mysterious inevitability, what remains with dreams is... Byron in the abyss." Su Ge thought of this . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
