			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing in front of tens of thousands of souls, Su Ge held a majestic and low voice with a long gun: "The confused and ignorant soul, 汝, etc. have faded past and greeted the new life. Standing Here, 汝 无 无 无 , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Head down in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my main kingdom, regardless of how you were born before, you can get eternal peace here, get the gospel of salvation, don't be nervous, don't be restrained, release yourself The soul, this is the eternal destination of eternal glory. In the fog, screaming in death, circling in dreams, flying in the cold wind, wherever my power is, is the place to sleep." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Lord God Wei Yongchang!" All the souls heard the incomparable excitement and joy, and shouted in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satisfied nodded, Su Ge finally said: "Let it go! If you want to be a warrior, you can go to Chuck and Pamela.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Su Ge’s body turned into a fog and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the departure of Su Ge, the pressure of dignity in the entire air gradually dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All souls are deeply relieved, although their Lord is very kind and tolerant, but the superiority is too powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuck’s high voice: “When you want to be my warrior, you can come here to register, we will conduct advanced statistics, and then report to my master. If you are lucky enough, you will be able to personally give the power of frost and have the qualification to ride the cold wind wolf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Male and female warriors To be separated, the male warrior went to Chuck, the female soldier came to me!" Pamela on the side held a long gun, not to be outdone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many envious people in these souls, and when they hear these shouts, they are very happy to join in and want to be the kind of warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, most souls don’t want to continue fighting, but want to sleep peacefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because most of these people are already very tired before they are born, such as Ron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t know why, he was completely tired of the dispute and even hated all thinking. At this time, he felt endless exhaustion, as if he was overdrafted after his death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the instinct, he came to the side of a quick ice tombstone, reaching out and gently touching it, the golden color of the soul gradually gathered and gathered together. In his eyes, his body turned into ice blue, and it seemed to be burning a strange blue wildfire, turning into a ghostlike appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron didn't care about this appearance, because at this time he didn't feel any discomfort, but because the transformation of the form became very comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly closing his eyes, Ron’s soul gradually turned into a cold wind, and fell into a deep sleep in the tombstone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a cold wind, Ron disappeared, leaving a dark blue weird symbol on the tombstone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other souls now seem to have found this trick, and can see thousands of souls quickly transform into ghost forms, and fall into the ice tombstones to fall asleep . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the tombstone does not look big, it seems to have a huge space for the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can see dozens of souls can enter a tombstone at the same time to sleep, leaving more than forty dark blue symbols outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these forty symbols only account for two-thirds of the tombstone volume, and it seems that they can live in more than twenty souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the temple, Su Ge opened his eyes and said with a hint of weirdness: "The tombstones are actually places where the soul is sleeping? And it seems Or a residential building, you can live more than 60 households at the same time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a bit interesting, although the graveyard looks a bit gloomy. But compared with the previous battleship Both in terms of scale and configuration, there are some characteristics of being a god god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting back on the throne, Su Ge looked around and found some changes inside the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, a lot of ice blue light appeared on the dark walls, from top to bottom, it seems that the temple is firmly fixed on the ground. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the space inside the temple seems to be getting bigger, and the relief on the dome becomes more beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the power of the belief that was consumed, Su Ge nodded with satisfaction: "Yes, it can be said that it is worth the money."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This problem is solved, the next step is to deal with Vanas's problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug I remembered that I had misunderstood a few days ago and resonated with my own spirit and broke into the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This world is a world of dreams, and the world of dreams is distorted and mutually imaginary. That is to say, the conditions for coming here are not only my initiative. Summon, there will be some people who can enter the place by mistake and accidentally because of their special ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the situation of the day, Vanas There are two main reasons for coming here, on the one hand, because the anger and sorrow caused by the death of a large area of ​​humanity resonate with my mentality at the time. Because a few months ago, a similar situation occurred in the Guinness Kingdom. At that time, Chuck reminded me to go out (see Chapter 117), but I didn't care at the time. On the other hand, the woman had her own talents related to death, which is a gift of talent."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That said, my current location is similar to the position of the group of sealed old dominators. Some special people can communicate directly through dreams, only But what I gave them was real help. Instead of whispering and maddening them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since this time you want to go to the Principality of Guinness, it is just a plea for my people. Let that woman accept the grace of her great deity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge is ready to summon Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait!" Suddenly, Su Ge thought of the knowledge he had learned in "Self-cultivation of the superiors." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
