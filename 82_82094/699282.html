			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night of the glory city is not calm, but at this time Su Ge did not feel any trace of anomaly, as the whole world has restored peace, everything The horror has gone away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Betty’s service, Su Ge simply ate something, for some unspeakable reasons, the pale face finally got some normal color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British sitting on the side of the worry: "Adult... I think we need to sue my master as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug wiped his mouth, calm and deep black eyes looked at Bernice, his mouth curled up, revealing a peaceful and kind smile: "The Lord does not know, for my situation The Lord naturally knows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict’s head is slightly low, and the tester asks: "That..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the test of the Lord." Su Ge reached out and touched her long purple hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty looked at Su Ge, and she felt that Su Ge seemed to have changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, Betty didn't know what Su Ge had experienced, but at this time it was obvious that Su Ge seemed to be "old" a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the physical aging, but the spiritual maturity and lubrication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a piece of amber that has experienced countless years of baptism, it is introverted and deep, full of unpretentious traces of age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that theocracy has dissipated, the mystery has left, but at this time Su Ge gives a more special temperament than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to give a clear feeling, the former and current Su Ge seems to have changed from a young and powerful fighter A master with knowledge and experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body has declined and blood is not enough. The young man’s punch can top him a few punches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even if the body is already so, the spirit and artistic conception have reached a perfect, a limit of realm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this incomplete, unsound body that gives the master a polar environment that ordinary people cannot understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is such a master in Betty’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystery dissipates, the vision is zero, the sanctuary of the gods has been withdrawn, and the karma of purifying countless souls is not in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the ordinary body can’t be ordinary, but Sug is standing in a state that Betty can’t describe, just like that old man. A master of fighting, but standing in the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benice did not notice what Betty was paying attention to. She was still struggling with Suge to lose all mysterious problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is different from Betty, he is very aware of the dangers of Su Ge today, and is also very aware of the Church of the Holy Blood and the desire of many cultists for Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current glory city is the most dangerous place for Su Ge, and also in these two days, the Church of the Holy Blood quickly increased for Su Ge Hunting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this critical moment, Su Ge lost all mystery and even the protection of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Longtan Tiger Cave, it is simply the behavior of self-investment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedicts clearly understands the importance of Su Ge to the church in the whole night, a little Suge is caught, then it is very likely that the entire church will suffer the Holy Blood The clamping of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, are you really worried?" Bernice asked in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "What are you worried about? I am a person who is far from mystery, and all the strange existences can no longer hurt me."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will send you out of the city overnight! It is ok to pass the Green Admiral." Bernice looked at Su Ge's smile more heartache and suddenly stood up and said . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her, Su Ge is not only a boss and a savior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the past, Su Ge has become what she values ​​most unconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Bernice rushed toward the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come back." In the face of such anxious Bernice, Su Ge just said two words calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No mystery, no majesty, this ordinary word, but like two mountains, generally on the body of Bernice, Let her take a step outside the door anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five seconds of struggle, Bernice was soft and fell back to Su Ge: "You really can’t stay here, so too. It’s dangerous.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s body leaned on the chair, hands on the abdomen, looking out the window and watching the night sky: “When it’s not leaving, this The second incident is not over yet, I have to witness an important thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is more important than your safety?" Bernice anxiously asked . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg’s deep-eyed turn: “The qualifications of the Church of the Holy Blood.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The qualification of the blood church?" Bernice suddenly stopped, what is the relationship between the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood up and put his hands in the wide sleeves of his pajamas, as if an old man was slowly moving forward in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Next, their performance will determine whether they are eligible for redemption."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When I heard this, Bernice suddenly felt a heart, and the heart of anxiety gradually settled down, and the eyes were more admired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s Wisdom She is very clear that Su Ge is not a blind arrogant person, but rather a very cautious wise man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Bernice feels a bit shy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clearly understands her idol so much. How can she not think of why he is so confident? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Relax," said Su Ge, stepping up the steps very slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the return?" Stepping on the steps, Su Ge is still thinking about four words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Normality...not induction, normalization is not integration. So, what is normalization?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the bedroom, Sugg was in a bed and pondered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nose slowly gasps, and the fragrance left by Shirley has not dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quilt that was covered before the two people, Su Ge took a deep breath: "The normality of two people is not a fusion, but a spirit and thoughts Unification."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge suddenly thought of the experience of the two men in the past year and a half, strangers from each other, no love It became the real couple nowadays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this process, when the two people are constantly in contact with the body, they are spiritually unified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unification, not normal, but ... there is a relationship between the two." Su Ge holding the quilt thought about it, and went to sleep. After <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, he did not dream, like ordinary people, entered a very deep deep sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dreamland of God, the whole country of God is more and more magnificent under the maintenance of Vanas, and everything is in perfect order, just like a dream kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pilgrimage hall, all the high-level church members listened to Bernice’s report and his face became very ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the existence of it, do you need to sacrifice the clock to such a degree?" Vanas’s eternal cold ice at this time has produced Some obvious fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Jerous said: "So, the king of yellow clothes is indeed repelled by the bell."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"King of the Yellow King!?" When I heard these four words, Randall, Adeline, Jenny and others were full of shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of yellow clothes, that is the third dynasty of the sands, the gods believed by the Calding dynasty, have disappeared, I don’t know how many years, how can it suddenly appear in The capital, and fight with the bell people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas asked: "What is the situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss explained immediately: " I have just got the news here. It seems that there is something. With the strongest psychic of the church in March, Myra has merged and summoned the king of yellow clothes by means of a sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Giving a sacrifice? It’s a group of madmen!" Luke heard the way of the sacrifice, the irony of his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas immediately asked: "After?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The situation afterwards is not clear I got the news this morning. The Ziyue Cathedral in the southeast of the city was attacked by the king of the Yellow Emperor. The entire square of the Holy See suffered a devastating blow. The pedestrians of the month were seriously injured."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the church’s briefing showed that the church was repulsing, I was still suspicious at the time. Now, it’s what the bell is doing.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to these, Vanas did not rush to rescue Su Ge, but first asked: "What is the current situation of the clockman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The mystery dissipates, the vision is zero, and even the ability to enter the kingdom of God is gone." Bernice said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible! This will be the case!" Silence, and Vegginia beside her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people are now known as the late bells, and the past is bound to rise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict’s face is very bad. “Although I don’t believe it, but it’s the truth, the clockman has now become a Ordinary people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! I immediately went to the capital!" Hills was anxious after listening, saying that he would withdraw from the Kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Su Ge, she and Bernice have a close relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This action was immediately organized by Vanas, and the white hand was slowly waving with the dark robes, and Hills found himself unable to leave the Kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope!" Hills is in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas said calmly: "Calm down, the clock is not as fragile as you think, wait for her to finish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Hills calmed down and returned to his position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the mental state of the clock?" Vanas continued to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict replied: "Very good, very good. The clockman is very calm now, and there is even a kind of mature and calm self-sufficiency." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What plans does he have?" Vanas asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis shook his head: "He didn't say it, but he said he wants to judge whether there is hope for redemption in the Church of the Holy Blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Vanas, Father Water, Gerlos, Adeline, Luke and others looked at each other and said, "Know, pick up Everything goes as usual, we will deal with the things of the bell people, you don't have to worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope speaks, and is also the strongest clothes tonic at the same time as the order is given. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Pope said, this big man will handle it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People gradually receded, leaving only five people, including Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since he has said it, then we have to be prepared," Vanas said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Water said: "My magic can start overnight, and the day after tomorrow can reach the capital."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Luke added: "I can't do it for the time being. The things here have not been processed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am ready here," Gerlos said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline followed and said, "I am always on call here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to these Vanas nodded slightly: "That's good, waiting for the order of the bell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Need to get in touch with the clock person? Give up all mystery, It is very likely that hunting and printing can not be used." Aidelin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas shook his head and said: "No, you can shoot directly when necessary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Timing, is it really mature?” asked Father Water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas looked up and looked forward: "This question, you should ask him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Vanas said that he ushered in his second sunrise after becoming an ordinary person and the first normal sunrise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what you feel in the morning, Su Ge gets up, changes clothes, washes, and eats breakfast, just like a man at home, ordinary can't be ordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benice has his own business and hurries away in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty staying at home is a little surprised to see Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Su Ge didn’t know what to do at this time, things were relatively slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is walking, raising your hand, even talking, blinking, all the movements seem to be an elderly person who is old and weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge noticed Betty’s surprise, slowly sipping a cup of black tea and spit out a hot breath saying, “It’s so delicious.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge held the teacup in both hands and looked at the mellow liquid inside. He said with a slight exclamation: "I haven’t carefully studied it before, but now I’ll slowly relish it. It’s really good.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty’s face is a bit red: “Thank you for complimenting.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black tea has always been her masterpiece, but her technique and habits are special. If she rushes to drink, she will not feel anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you savor it, it’s fragrant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is the second person to taste her tea, the first one is Shirley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have a special aura, a pure aura. This special aroma is the aura of the aura." Sug said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty excited to pick it up: "Are you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, did not recover, It was Shirley who told me before." Su Gehaha smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty was a little disappointed with his mouth and looked very cute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugwan leans on the chair like an old grandfather, slowly saying: "My past life was spent in a fast and messy way. Others' knowledge is neat. Unification, my knowledge is chaotic. It took me several decades to become a master. I only spent a year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too fast! Fast I feel that something is not true!” Su Ge said, taking another sip of tea, closing his eyes and savoring his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I am missing a lot of things, like this tea, I have been drinking many times before, but I have not found this inner fragrance, it is a pity. Su Ge holding a teacup is like holding a rare treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty made Su Ge even more embarrassed, and her tea is not worthy of praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time, spend in this boring ordinary tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cup of tea, placed in a special mug, Su Ge spent two hours to drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time comes to ten o'clock in the morning, gentle and radiant sunshine in the capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugar, who finished the tea, stepped forward, hands behind him, slowly walked out of the house, staring at the sky, like an old sunbathing Cat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
