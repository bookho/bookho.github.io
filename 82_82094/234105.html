			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge woke up, she felt that she was being held by a pair of powerful arms, her head resting on some hard raised breasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up, the first thing that comes to your attention is a black, streamlined leather armor and dark, dense scales in the gaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the Pope, are you awake?" The happy female voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly, and when he saw that Seas was holding his own posture, he suddenly said: "Let me down!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills stopped to drop Sug and said, "It’s just really endangered!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;柏Niss smiled and said: "Fortunately, there are Luobo's guidelines."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge moved his body and looked around the darkness to find himself near the streets of the north of the city. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right! Rogan is still trapped in the Church of the Holy Blood to cover me." Su Ge thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Marx immediately said: "This is not used, today's action is before Mr. Logan and us to discuss."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Recommended?" Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marx nodded: "Yes, but on the road, we have to rush to the north of the monastery as soon as possible, and Ida Newton is now in danger!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this Sugerton, I was shocked and rushed out without saying anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline immediately said: "We have a carriage here, take the carriage past!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the man boarded the carriage, he was driven by Hills to move quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell is going on, make it clear." Su Ge asked seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marx explained: "The cause of the incident is from the last Green Flame Brotherhood. When Master Gerlos was leaving, the captain of the captain should pay a little attention to Bishop Ron. The captain has been secretly observing the situation. In the evening, when you encounter a black man, the murder of Bishop Ron is monitored by mysterious means, and the recorded information inside is completely emptied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Master Gerlos!?" Su Ge looked unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelin whispered: "I have seen Gerlos once before, and he told me that Ron is really not right. The event in the ghost ship is He faintly refused to allow Gerlos to conduct an in-depth investigation and direct his attention to the Twin Alliance. After coming to the Green Flame Brotherhood, he interfered several times and finally forced him to be transferred urgently."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s frowning question: “That is, have you seen the action that night?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the captain's enchantment spreads throughout Bain in the dark, otherwise you can think that a big city can rely on just three patrols to get it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Su Ge, then immediately asked: "When I fainted that day, who actually shot and injured the black man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, Marx’s face said with a trace of eccentricity: "I can’t count it, after I fainted that day, Ida Newton came over to look for you, and the black man glanced at it. After Newton up like mad, dug directly under his eyes, turned and ran. "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Shua! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of hearing this news, Sugg’s mind seems to be a key node being opened, and many things become instantly clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that the person at the Institute of Polar Studies is indeed committing suicide because he touched something when he gave the Ada thing to the evil thoughts and saw no. The things I saw, so I would say that I was guilty, and I took out my eyes and my heart. The posture at that time was not placed by others, it was his own!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is still the qj guilty, and Aidana's good deeds beyond the ordinary people, understanding and tolerance..." At this moment, Su Ge thoroughly realized that the warm and kind sister around her actually It is a transcendental existence that he can't understand at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marx continued: "After that we investigated the background of Aida Newton in detail, she found that she suddenly appeared from five years ago. Two years ago, she mixed into Bain City and wiped out everything in her past. At the same time, she physically The kind of good deeds that feel strange, and the temperament that can't make people hostile, have completely exceeded the limits of normal people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a detailed investigation and a large amount of literature investigation, the captain determined that Ada Newton was surrounded by a more advanced existence. However, the existence is still in a passive state of sleep, and there is not enough spiritual vision to see him. Threat. This also explains Ron’s strange actions at the time, and he did not dare to do it for you for more than three months.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside De Lin was surprised by the three people. They all saw Ada, but they never felt any abnormality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger said after a few seconds of silence: "What is the situation now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" For about a month, Father Harold, a missionary of the Glorious Church, met with Bishop Ron. After a month, the two men were in close contact and movement, and we found that the knife and axe with them disappeared. "At this point, Marx's face is not good." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline immediately sighed: "Replacement!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marx nodded : "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is replacement surgery? Teacher." Bernice asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline explained: "That is one of the secrets of the Glorious Church. The core of the replacement technique is replacement, or exchange, one thing. Through sacrifice, use one's life as a bargaining chip to exchange for a higher level of existence with what you need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marx said: "Two people should reach The deal. So Harold will use his companion's life to cure Ron's eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The price is Ada. And the reason is because they Need a pure holy virgin dedicated to the elders of the church to pass on, right?" Su Ge thought of the record of the shining church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Virgin has always been a very bad custom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of the church are the core of the Glorious Church, each of them has a form and power that is far more extraordinary. In order to allow their strength to continue, every time you need to offer a pure and kind beauty virgin, through the relationship with the woman to give birth to the child, so that the seeds of power can continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also this disgusting way that the glorious church without the Grail of the Grail has almost the same status and territory as the three churches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marx said: "According to our recent observations, Ida Newton’s power is completely passive. Under normal circumstances, there is no difference between ordinary people and ordinary people. Resist her kind of aura and temperament, and the vision will not see what should not be seen. It can be said that it is easy to walk away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘎Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge clenched his fists and his face was gloomy: "The time is really good. I will put me under house arrest and recover the injury. After I come out, I am sure Ida was After the people of the Glorious Church walked away, they directly touched me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marx said: "I let Bobby protect Ada there, hoping to catch up. Fifteen minutes later, when Sugg arrived at the monastery, Marx found Bobby who was seriously injured and fell to the monastery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bobby!" Seeing this, Marx rushed over, then took out a blood-red needle in his hand and plunged into Bobby's thigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough.........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With blood infusion, Bobby coughed up two bloody sputum Open your eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry!" The pale face was apologetic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge clenched his fist and bit his teeth: "Where did the three bastards go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, but they leave words, you better not chase, or they will be welcome." Bobby said weakly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
