			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few people who notice that Su Ge’s mentality changes, and Chenguang is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Holy Father in the Church of the Holy Blood, the Holy Father is the true inner holiness, and the devout faith and clean spirit give him a kind of person. A special perception that cannot be achieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can clearly feel the goodwill and malice inside a person's heart, and use this to understand the essence of a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His ability is like the morning light when the sun is rising, people can feel peace of mind and hope all the time, the name of the morning light is . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as in the ancient city of Azo, after several brief contacts with Su Ge, he fully realized the goodwill of Su Ge for the whole world, and Patience and hope throughout the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Su Ge’s heart was like a warm sun, which made him feel incomparably soft and gentle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after the whole battle went deep, and finally, when Su Ge took the dragon away, he already felt that the goodwill of Su Ge’s heart was rapidly decreasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not anger and hostility, just a disappointment for the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at that time, he still saw the light of hope in the heart of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, when he once again looks far away to Su Ge, who has completely become an ordinary person, his face reveals him more than 100 Very rare regrets and regrets in the past years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, he has not seen any light in the heart of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the heart is more thorough, cleaner, and firmer than in the ancient city of Aya. It is like the cleanest existence in the world. Any pollution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this kind of clean, he can only feel the chilling dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of dullness is not a habit, but an indifference, the gods that are high above, the indifference to the life and death of the ants under their feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that in the understanding of Su Ge, the Church of the Holy Blood has lost the need to continue to exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He should have been here for a long time, so it will be so disappointing to the Church of the Holy Blood now." The morning light has a complicated sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his life, there are only two people who can make him care so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One was Sherry who was originally a container and was sealed, and the second one was Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former is 愧疚, the latter is sorry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has always believed that no matter what Su Ge meets, they will stand with them, but now, this hope has been completely shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, they are right." Good morning partner, Yu Hui, a good friend, suddenly sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn light glanced at him: "What did you see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Walter... ...changed." Yu Hui seems to see through some of Father Water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Walt did not come, only the magic of his rule knowledge." Chenguang reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yu Hui nodded slightly: "Although I didn't come, it didn't make any difference to symbolize my knowledge. A few years ago, Walter fled under my gaze. The Holy Blood Maze."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why did he leave?" The reason why Walter left was so far unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Yuhui knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning light nodded slightly, he still knows this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afterglow continued: "Walth was in contact with a certain existence in the old dream because of a battle, and since then he has been entangled in that existence. The nightmare messenger is constantly pursuing him and wants to harvest his life. He continues to stay in the maze of blood, only one dead end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He fled at the beginning At the time, I saw that he still had a ten-year life. No matter how he is, no matter how he sleeps, those monsters will find him completely through his connection with the world after ten years. He will eat him."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Morning light changed his face slightly: "There is still such a thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afterglow nodded, Looking up at the statue of the March goddess in front, said: "However, I saw this time, his knowledge, all the dead temperament in his psionic power has disappeared, even the smell that is approaching corruption has changed. Robust and energetic. It can be judged that he has solved the entanglement of that one, and the knowledge and system have approached The huge expansion of the limit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Yu Hui looked at the morning light seriously: "Do you know? I am now... I can’t feel the end of his life. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean...he is integrating with knowledge!?" Chen Guang said with shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world, only one kind of existence is eternal, and that is knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yu Hui murmured: "I am afraid that it is not knowledge, but some kind of rule."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "He is known as the Death Apostle, remembering that there is an apostle in the ancient city of Aya." The morning light thought of the cold man who could be tied with the lord by the master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The War Apostle!" Yu Hui knows a lot about the ancient city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning light looked up and looked at the night sky outside the glass: "Death, war, from this sequence, there must be other apostles. Behind the church There is a true God who can directly interfere with the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this is not manpower can be achieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's not just interference, it's not hard to see from the events in Bain City that if you really reach some necessary conditions, he can even come directly." Afterglow gave his own thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of this, the two people look at each other and their eyes are full of worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the case, then they are fighting a true god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! You can't let them die like this." The morning light suddenly stood up and turned and went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yu Hui grabbed him and asked, "What are you doing? You can't stop anyone now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Do you let me watch, two organizations that can redeem the world fight each other!" The gentle and kindly Holy Father finally showed an anxious appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yu Hui took him to sit down: "It’s just like this, the Church of the Holy Blood... It’s time to let the position."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the morning light suddenly shocked and hurriedly asked, "Are you seeing something again?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afterglow is somewhat lonely, but more is relieved and decisive: "I saw, the church collapsed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this Sitting in the bench in the morning, I laughed and said: "Indeed, the world really needs some changes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Holy Father explored a very high-level problem, the interior of the capital was already open at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides have the dominators and the lords at this time, then the next fight is the hard power of the real gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the church in the late bell has an absolute advantage in personal strength, it is very difficult to fight in the face of people who are three times more than themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of the Church of the Holy Blood have an incomparable understanding of the city. They are a group of people, forming a special formation, relying on the advantages of familiar terrain, actually living The elite of the church in the evening bell dragged into a protracted war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a protracted war is very unfavorable for the church in the late night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an enemy of three, the potion time is only half an hour, and his strength will be greatly discounted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The late bell church believers who have been fighting for a round, with the consumption of psionic energy, gradually got tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slap in the face of a hunter, and Jean, who was bleeding from the body, took a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This blood is mostly enemies, but he also has a lot of wounds and bullet marks on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although not fatal, continued bloodshed caused his physical strength to begin to drain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, the two dominators have no tacit understanding of the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are very clear that if two people take the shot, the other party has the ability to kill all the people on their own side at the moment of their own shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the war became a battle for two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your body is not here, you are not my opponent, Walter." The flame dominator burns and easily blocks the black wind that keeps blowing. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Waterman waved the sickle in his hand and made a calm voice under the hood: "When you come to this step, you and I should be very clear. Have the knowledge The right, and thus the rules of contact, do not exist on the ontology and the avatar. Even if this one makes the devil not enough, but it is enough to drag you to tomorrow morning. Before that, the bell will end all ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is just an ordinary person who is graceful. How can he terminate all things without any means of attack? It is a idiotic dream." Flame Dominator calms. The answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fr. Water did not explain, just a calm answer: "He said that the end, you can end. Because he is a clockman, ringing the night clock People."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame dominators were not scared by this because they knew that their real means were not themselves, but that these pagans could not imagine The horror exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bang.........Bang.........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a series of explosions, both sides left the battlefield at the same time , return to your own camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge died of twelve werewolves, can be said to be extremely huge losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, every werewolf is an expert mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the people have suffered different degrees of injury, and even a dozen werewolves have lost their combat power and are undergoing healing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Blood Church has suffered a lot of losses here. The 600-person team is now more than 100 dead, and the remaining two hundred. Many people were injured and 50 clerics lost their fighting capacity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wide neighborhood is full of blood and corpses everywhere. This is where the Hui Yao City is just the inside of the ancient city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Almost!" Laurie looked at the time, and the duration of Mill's potion was about to pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mil who lost the potion, he can deal with it himself, and the remaining two archbishops can directly participate in other battles to end this farce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Almost." Just as Laurie was preparing to order, he heard the voice of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the bluff, you do have a set, Suger Sotos." Laurie sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s straightforward response: “The bluff, I did have a very good set before, with this skill, I set up the evening clock with my own power. Church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three bishops sneered and did not respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continued: "But now, for you, I have even lost the patience and interest of bluffing. For those who are helpless, say more Words are waste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, come on! Let me see what you mean by almost!" The one-eyed bishop has already This kind of grid is not too slow, it seems that it has the infinite endless attitude of grinding and losing all patience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now wants to kill everyone around Su Ge, watching him show his desperate expression in helplessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is a pity that he could not see Su Ge’s expression in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug expands his arms and sighs: "The decaying world needs to change, the filthy people need to trample, and the world polluted by blood hopes to be redeemed and washed. Come on! Follow the war, trample on the decaying world, and bring the apostle of God who has shattered the dawn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the sound of Su Ge, several people suddenly look Change: "Don't you really have a backhand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible! This is the most elite group of hunters in the entire sect, led by Archbishop Gerlos. Even if they grow their wings, they will never fly in!" said the Archbishop of the Wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hehehe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing his words, there was a sudden surge in the sky. laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd looked up and found that the laughter came from Walter’s hood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you laughing at! You are a traitor!" asked the Windy Archbishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the support of the flames, and the protection of the sky, he is not afraid of this dominator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame dominator was also somewhat surprised at this time, and he did not know why he laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter converges on a smile and looks at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled and gestured to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter rarely said in a special and funny way: "Why don't you think about it, I can join the church in the late bell, the whole country of Guinness has joined the night. Bell Church, these are under the control and domination of your self-righteousness. Then why are you so sure that no other important clerics join the church of the late bell!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;! ! ! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, the face of someone at the site, including the three archbishops and the flame dominator, is extremely ugly at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whistling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A horrible cold wind that is completely different from the wind. Blowing into the battlefield with frost and snowflakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒......啪嗒......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the cold wind, the crisp footsteps are Everyone’s ears rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the stiff, everyone turned around and saw the cold man wearing a special uniform in the church of the late bell, carrying a sword of ice behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie knows him, this is the war apostle who had played against him several times in the ancient city of Aya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goddess is on...this is not true..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
