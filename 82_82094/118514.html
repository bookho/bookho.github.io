			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart seems to be very confident, there is no other preparation besides these three kinds of equipment, take the Su Ge and Erha and leave the building, do it Bart’s exclusive luxury carriage, not the first to go to Joseph’s home, but the museum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are sitting in the carriage, Su Ge has a clear improvement at this moment, watching Bart ask: "You seem to have a certain power here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart smiled and said: "Of course, no one can go through the money. Tell you, businessmen are the least desire for money, the most desirable people are those." "The person who holds the power but has no money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge heard this sudden move, and he kept researching how to knock his head and flashed a let Su Ge is very happy thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you are so powerful, I want to ask you to do me a favor." Su Ge looks casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad held a crystal cane and said with a smile: "Of course, we are now partners who trust each other very much."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge touched the head of Erha: "I want you to help me deal with the identity of the two witches."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Witches !?" Hearing this Bart look is tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing has been synonymous with danger and instability since ancient times. Su Ge said faintly: "Reassure, these two witches have obtained the shelter and knowledge of my Lord by contributing to me... my Lord's faith, they are now The sarcoma on the body has been covered by the power of my Lord, there is no possibility of violent walk. And the appearance has changed, no one will recognize that two people are the former witches."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this Barth, the temptation asks: "Are you sure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you not believe me? Don't believe in my Lord?" Su Ge's eyebrows picked up, and his eyes flashed a smug disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart hurriedly said: "Of course it doesn't mean this, it's just a matter of caution on the witch's question."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not afraid of Su Ge, but he is afraid of the existence of Su Ge's body that can come to the world at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "I understand, after all, the custom of the past is like this. But you can rest assured, I dare to guarantee the honor of my Lord, these two witches There are no problems today, not only absolute security, but also won't be discovered by anyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Bart immediately believed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beliefs of this world can be different from other worlds, those beliefs are really there, and they are very clear about what you are doing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a believer, the most convincing oath is to swear with the god of their faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It shouldn't be like a lie, this guy is always connected with that person, such an oath can almost be regarded as the promise of that one." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Bart’s eyebrows said: "We are a faithful partner, you help me so much, I naturally will not refuse your request." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug immediately laughed: "I know that you are a trustworthy partner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I can use the relationship tonight, get two blank identifications and register the relevant documents. You need to tell the details of both of them and the age. If I am at work, I still need Deal with the tax payment certificate and academic certificate. As for identity, the most convenient is the foreigner from the field, are you right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug immediately nodded and said: That's right! This is great!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two people talked happily , The carriage gradually stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside chauffeur whispered, "Mr., it’s here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this, two At the same time, they converge on a smile and look solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people and a dog walked down the carriage from the side door and looked at the still calm museum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't go ahead." Bart stepped forward, raised his crystal cane and waved a few times in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excellent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low a word, call it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge felt a wind that didn’t know how to describe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, Ba’s characteristic head said: “Go, there is no ambush inside.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Said, stepping on the steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes glanced at the crystal cane in Bart’s hand and asked, “Is this a secret treasure?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret treasure, the full name of the mysterious treasure, is something related to mystery, or it is a mysterious condensation, a possession of powerful mysterious power or other existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the book of the Necromancer mentioned by Rogan and Gerlos was a secret treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart shook his head and said, "This is not a secret treasure, it is a mysterious costume."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mystery Gifts?" Su Ge, he has not heard of this vocabulary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart casually explained: "The secret treasure is a powerful treasure that has undergone a long history or has been stained or condensed by a powerful mystery. The mastery of secret treasure is very difficult, and if pro If the degree is not enough, it is completely uncontrollable, and there is even the danger of being refuted at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nod, this theory he had heard before in the death sect . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad waved his cane and said: "Mysterious costumes are much softer. Most of them are tools made by humans. It is a better release to help our mysterious people." And props that use their own knowledge, either auxiliary or enhanced. Compared to the metaphor of the image, the mysterious costume is like the exclusive equipment belonging to our mystery. They can be clothes, can be armor, and can be any common items." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Bart pointed to the pendant of the goddess in the chest of Su Ge and said: "This pendant of the inductive monster is one of the most basic mysterious costumes. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
