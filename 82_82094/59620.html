			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Su Ge was tangled, a few harsh applause sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s head is not back, faintly said: “Sure enough to have a relationship with you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp With Su Ge’s current grasp of the sound, about half a minute ago, when he just killed the black robe, he heard Patt’s special gasping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart quietly came out of the shadows and said with a smile: "Dear Sug, I see it, you need help."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you help me?" Su Ge did not refuse, and turned to a faint question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart came over and raised his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hula! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of green flames rises in the palm of his hand, a random sprinkle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green flame burns on the body, but Su Ge does not feel any temperature, only gives a gloomy feeling of coldness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, there is no black smoke, no burnt smell, and no corpse. The body, together with the blood, the flesh of the body quickly burned and left nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow under the corpse has not been affected, it is still as white as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing such a strange scene, Su Ge’s eyes narrowed and stared at Bart and asked, “Are you an enemy or a friend?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bat said with a smile: "For businessmen, there are no enemies and friends, only the interests exist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After that, Bart stared at Su Ge and asked, "So cute Mr. God, do you have the benefit to make me earn?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug gently pinches the cane Put it in front of you and say calmly: "It depends on what you want to get."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart said slightly sideways: "I believe that you don't mind changing a place to talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked down at the blood on his palm and took a deep breath. : "That's best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two quickly disappeared into the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five minutes later, three night patrols appeared along with the ringing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There seems to be a mysterious trace here." Marx set aside the snow on the ground and looked at the footprint that had no shape at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan looked around and said, "There is a slight bloody smell in the air, but it is unfortunately covered up by special methods."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bobby said nervously: "Is the death sect back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogen shook his head: "Not yet Certainly, it may be a battle between other extraordinary people, but the level is not high, it is estimated that it is two apprentices, the threat is not big, just record it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; In a coffee shop in Yujin Street, Su Ge, who had finished the blood, sat in a chair and drank a high concentration of sugar-free coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad slightly looked at Su Ge with awe and sighed: "All said that genius is a freak, now believe it. You can drink this coffee." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge put down the cup and said, "I often have headaches. This kind of coffee has a good pain-relieving effect, and I get used to it over time."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are now more familiar. After a simple greeting, Su Ge first asked: "Do you have a division in your organization?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad, a flash of light in his eyes said, "How do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said slowly and unspokenly: "I Have an understanding of your organization, and just that person said that you are a traitor, they are the orthodox Green Flame Brotherhood. But from your code of conduct, you are more in line with my impressions."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!? When did you find out?" Bart came to interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger said casually: "I came out to pick up your attendant that day, I know, Jike? He was kidnapped by three Green Flame Brotherhood people a few days ago. I was there when they were rescued. He didn't see me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only these?" Bart didn't believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continued: "You said that you are an investor, and that your attendant just happened to have a relationship with the Green Flame Brotherhood. According to my impression, Green Flame The organization of the Brotherhood is not evil. They have a lot of resources, like to invest, and expect people to advance their technology. They are very low-key and active in the shadows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Su Ge said with a smile: "And is the name of the Tuol Investment Company somewhat obvious? The name that symbolizes the powerful existence of the original life and death has two words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Bart’s heart suddenly jumped two times and almost didn’t jump from the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?!" Bart tried to keep his tone calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy’s understanding of them made him feel extremely fearful. He even knew the name of the god who only existed in the legend! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only a few core members of the Green Flame Brotherhood who know this name, and few people know that there are only a few strong players above the dominator level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge slowly took a sip of coffee and said, "A little sergeant who knows more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Bart squinted, and his body gradually gave off a gloomy momentum: "Looking out, you are not a member of the Church of the Holy Blood. You are so rashly saying this secret, I am not afraid that I will kill you?" You should be very clear, I have this ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not answer, calmly said: "Your question I have finished answering, you should answer me. What do you want to do here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart did not continue to ask, and the momentum turned and smiled and said: "I came here to help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help us!?" A glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart said: "The Green Flame Brotherhood is an organization that has been inherited and developed for a long time. In the long process of development, it is inevitable that there will be development differences. Split."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded and said, "Well, this is understandable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I This time I got the information, a branch of the Green Flame Brotherhood is preparing for an evil sacrifice to summon something terrible. We are eager for low-key development and don't want too many people to notice. If this Once things happen, then we will be placed on the cusp again, so the purpose of my visit this time is to stop their evil sacrifices and to minimize the negative effects of things. It is best to quietly before things happen. Dispose of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard this and touched his chin and said, "That is, the one who just attacked me is a member of your branch organization? Because of me I will guide you the road in a few days, thinking that I am your accomplices, so kill me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad snorted, then apologetically said: "Although I thought they would attack, but did not expect that they would send a mad believer." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mad believer?" Su Ge stunned, this profession, Jerox did not have books in his. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart casually explained: "The mad believer is born in a religious profession, through devout faith, at the expense of some reason, thus losing fear and gaining other aspects. Zeng Fu.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The apprentice who just attacked you is to improve your physical fitness so that your physical fitness can be judged by the apprentices of the fighters.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened to this situation and thought about it. He said casually: "That means you have been using me as a bait for the past few days?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart smiled and said: "Everyone is a win-win situation. You help me pull out the tail. I can give you information and let you make a great contribution to this matter. The favor of the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
