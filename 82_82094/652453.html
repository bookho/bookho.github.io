			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to this leader, do you know anything else?" Su Ge asked. Green shook his head: "They are hiding a little deep, we haven't figured it out yet. As for her true identity, her Majesty knows by chance, otherwise we I thought about breaking my head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded, and said in the heart: "Although the entire royal intelligence system is still completely suppressed by the Church of the Holy Blood, they It does have some things that the Church of the Holy Blood does not know. Or, the Church of the Holy Blood did not notice the growth of the royal family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dreck How is it?" Su Ge asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green snorted: "It has been completely indulged in the gentle township of a woman. It is estimated that he has been completely mastered by Meris."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mind if your pawn is taken away by someone else?" Su Ge asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green likes to laugh and ask: "Is this my piece?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha Haha!" Su Gehaha laughed, and the laughter was hearty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next two people chatted for a while, Su Ge got a list from Green's hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This list is a list of cult members who have been surveyed after their investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s accidental discovery even has some members of the cult who are in important positions in the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green sneer and laughed: "The March church and the cults are not so visible on the surface, black and white. There are no eternal enemies in front of the interests, as long as They can maintain the rule of the world, they have already made a lot of transactions with those cults. Even some horrible sacrifices are done by themselves, and then pushed to the heads of those cults. In March, the church gave them room for development."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cold Church, Polar Institute, Gemini Alliance, Vikula, Flame Teaching... No wonder Father Sini will become like this." Su Ge looked at the list and murmured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know Father Sini?" Hearing Su Ge's self-talk, Green glanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge puts up the list and says, "Well, what happened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green sighs: "You better stay away from him. This person is the kind of real horror. If he knows your true identity, he will chase you to the ends of the earth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "You seem to be a little scared?" Su Ge felt Green's tone with little caution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green looks out the window: "I have worked with him, I have seen his madness. He is a real cold, vicious person. Anyone who insults the goddess takes extreme bloody means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he turned his head: "But now the Holy Blood Church relies on it. Such people maintain their prestige. Without them and the Holy Father, the name and reputation of the Church of the Holy Blood has collapsed. Even many believers do not believe in the church, but the Holy Father and these mad believers."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly replies: "Everyone has a double-sidedness. Father Cagnes may be the most terrifying nightmare for those cults. But for ordinary people He is the most sturdy barrier. If one day the city is captured by a cultist, even if everyone runs, he will fight to the last moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Green is silent, his eyes are looking at Su Ge, his brows are gradually wrinkled: "I have some I don't understand you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green grabs the feeling and says: "If you don't understand, you can understand everyone's strength field, everyone's thinking and philosophy. Even if that person is your enemy, you don't like people, you can clearly understand each other's motivation and persistence, not like Others blindly deny the existence of others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Shirley suddenly felt that Su Ge seemed to understand every one. People think, he rarely denies others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge explained: "I know a lot, I know a lot, and I am good at empathy. And I always think that people are good at nature. Every one is good. Every one There are some reasons for the wicked to do evil. There are only a few wicked people who have no reason at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green did not continue to speak after listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sitting for a while, Su Ge and Shirley turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two people left completely, Green turned around and took out a stone that looked like a human ear. The tone was respectful and asked: "How do you feel? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lazy ordinary voice in the stone: "It's very interesting, let him do it and see how deep his knife can be inserted." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! I will cooperate with Coase."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Drake's The inspection report came out." The voice came out slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green listened quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice continues: "According to the teacher's examination, this Drake's body is giving birth to a god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God!?" Hearing this, Green said aloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, so this young man is interesting. This bred god is the back hand he dares to be here."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the voice made a happy smile: "This kind of person will be very interesting, let him let go. The teacher said that the world will undergo tremendous changes in the next few years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the carriage, Su Ge looks at the list in his hand, his mouth is exposed Some insidious smiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You intend to do it yourself?" asked Shirley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s list of shook his head: “It’s too hard to do it yourself, and it’s too risky. Now we need to mess up the whole city.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Need my children to play?" Shirley’s eyes lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
