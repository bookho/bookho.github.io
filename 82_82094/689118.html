			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Myra’s clinic, Su Ge was careful to leave the clinic with a book that couldn’t be named. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked out of Myra’s bedroom, the scene changed again and he came to the world of vision again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time he stood in an abandoned house full of vines and moss, and the clean floor and room had disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Su Ge also found all new situations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time he looked up and always felt something staring at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things are not one, but exist in the form of plurals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Su Ge did not feel any malicious in that gaze, but this feeling of being stared is very bad, there is a feeling of thorns on the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is going on? Is it because of the advent of the king of yellow clothes that caused instability in the world of vision? Or other reasons for the world to start Is there a cross in the real world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger can’t understand now, he can only leave here quickly and return home to study the quirky books of this book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning along the corridor, the room of the world of vision does not know how many years have passed, full of decaying taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sug went to the blink of an eye in the clinic, the world returned to the normal world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just after returning, Su Ge saw a person standing in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Father of Sini, who is carrying a purple sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini looked at Su Ge, his face was not so good, it seemed to be mentally damaged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between the two is not good, and can even be said to be a completely hostile enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at each other two meters apart, Su Ge did not take the lead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini looked at Su Ge, and then his eyes fell on the big book at the waist of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Father Cagnes tightened his eyes and reached out and said, "Give me this book, it doesn't belong to you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't belong to you." Su Ge naturally knows the precious and calm answer of this book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Father Sini tightens the sword and steps forward: "For the time being, I don't want to kill you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you kill me?" The brow under the mask of Su Ge was picked, with a hint of dissatisfaction in his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today's Su Ge is no longer a small person before, he has his own arrogance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini’s expression is awkward: “You can experience it with your life.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Speaking, there was a burst of purple light particles around his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug's cane became a long sword, and with the arrival of the bell, the dark feathers of death began to float in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he was not sure to deal with Father Sini, but now it is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can now use a trace of authority that belongs to the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two people are ready to fight, the surrounding scene changes again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the dampness of the world of vision, there are two unnamed dominators in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing two people, the indescribable octopus of the octopus made a scream in the mouth, and the body turned into a black shadow and rushed to the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two naturally know that they are light and heavy, and although the body is still rushing forward, the goal is naturally not the other party, but the two horrible Yi people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Su Ge wants to give a priest to Sini, without any hesitation, to directly open the form of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the white hand under the bell sleeves holding the long sword, in the moment of being close to the unnamed dominator, the sword grows with a lot of pale blue The flame formed a flame curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔嚓...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold flame that has been strengthened by the power of death is not in the name of burning At the same time, it quickly freezes its body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unnamed dominator with a strange biological form was not frozen in an instant, and the horrible body actually went forward and moved closer to two meters. The tortoise's tentacles stretched hard and stopped at a distance of less than twenty centimeters from the Suger Hood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand with the glove is raised and gently placed a little above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔嚓......咔嚓......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a shrill burst of sound, unnamed dominator It became a land of ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Father of Sini in the same room has a very good physical combat ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have a good understanding of this powerful Dai, the moment of the face to escape the attack, the purple sword accurately stabbed the roots of the tentacles of the unnamed dominator Then, suddenly, the sharp sword directly cut the tentacle holding the wheelchair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶嘶嘶...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tentacle is cut, the unnamed governor screams A hurriedly, the body hurried back two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gap between the priests and Sinier glanced at Su Ge, and his eyes tightened like nails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a bit of agility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This increase has made Father Cagne more horrified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has 72 points of vision, and now unless he sees the false gods, the existence of the gods incarnation level, otherwise the vision will not grow casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, however, just a glance at the glance, it made him feel a little fearful about Su Ge’s true identity. guess. [br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, his psychological quality is very good, the fear and horror only lasted for less than a second, he immediately regained his gaze and continued to deal with this unnamed dominator . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His melee skills and techniques are several dozen higher than Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Su Ge’s gaze, he is physically relaxed, and his techniques are mature and stable. All six tentacles of the indescribable doctrine are cut, and finally the sword follows it. The sly mouth pierced and penetrated the whole body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glimpse of the weird liquid on the sword, after the turn of Father Sini, it just happened to see the innumerable blue mist disappearing into the body of Su Ge, the majesty The powerful figure has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence for five seconds, Father Sini whispered, "What the hell are you, you are definitely not an ordinary pagan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Father Sini did not call Su Ge a cultist, but a pagan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between words has already brought about a dramatic change in the identity of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sounds calm, with a deep tone in his tone: "The person who holds the night clock is the clockman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bell man..." When he heard these three words, Father Sini seemed to think of something and fell into deep meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing the two unnamed dominators, Su Ge did not stop and turned and walked down the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini will certainly not let Su Ge like this, and quickly follow up: "I advise you not to touch this book, this book is not you." I can control and use it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked down at the big book tied to his waist and glanced at him: "You dare to say I don't know if you are too tall to read this book, or I am too sorry for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Sini saw that Su Ge had no meaning of returning. He whispered: "This book is called the book of peeping truth, which records extraordinary content far beyond human imagination. Ordinary people simply cannot understand this content. After watching it, it will only go crazy and become the guardian of the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Peeping into the book of truth? Are you saying that the truth is recorded here?" I didn’t have the slightest fear when I heard this, but I was interested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When speaking, two people have already left the clinic, and the sky is completely dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini put the sword back behind him and said calmly: "The deception of the truth is a kind of protection for us, because for the vast majority of people, know the truth. After that, the rest went crazy and crashed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened to the silence and nodded slightly: "I recognize your words. I don't know who is fearless, there are When you are ignorant, you know more than you know happiness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you know, return this book to me." Father Sini said very seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg still has no action to return, and asked with interest: "I am curious, since this book is so important, why should it be paid? Keep it to Myra? Her speciality and danger, you should know very well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini puts the sword behind his back, it seems in tone With some helplessness: "Because in this world, this book is the safest in the hands of Myra, and at the same time want to safely place this book, it can only be placed in the hands of Myra."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?" This suddenly attracted Su Ge's curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini did not answer directly, with a vigilant question in his eyes: "How do you know the identity of Myra? She has countless special The procedure is to hide her special existence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a friend and Myra is a good friend. After that my friend has an accident, please Take care of her. She said that she does not want her good friend to become a god of evil." Su Ge's eyes calmly answered, without any flickering lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini bowed his head and sighed: "She didn't believe in the church until now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Do you believe it?" Su Ge asked with a hint of sarcasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini felt this sarcasm, but still said truthfully: "Do not believe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge did not continue to speak, he is not a person who likes to poke people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I knew she was not waiting there all the time." Father Sini continued as he said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know who my friend is?" Su Ge was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, for some reason, I know a lot of things that I shouldn't know." Father Sini was a little heavy in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s mind began to tell the turn, and the next second he said, “You read this book!”<br /><br />&nbsp Father's murky eyes with deep sighs: "How can I see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This important book must be an important treasure of the church." It’s impossible for Mela’s church to be ignorant. However, until now, only you have come here, which is inconsistent with the church’s action. The only explanation is that the church does not know that this book is here at Myra.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, you seem to know too much about this book. As you just said, for some reason, you know a lot of things you shouldn’t know. Things, these things have caused your beliefs to collapse into endless darkness and fear. At that time, you felt the purple moonlight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Su Ge's analysis, Father Sini felt more frightened while jumping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He admires Suger’s ability to think logically and admire Su Ge’s knowledge and courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was a captain of the Expeditionary Force of the Holy Swords." Father Sini sat on the left side of the street bench and took a deep breath. The deep eyes look at the darkness in the distance. This looks like the old predecessor next to the fire, telling the younger generation of their courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug sat on the right side of the street bench, like two people who didn’t know at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sini continued: "When I was in the expedition of a cursed fishing village, I suffered a curse, and it was enchanted. I found this book in the body of a false god. I saw this book. In the moment, my head was completely flooded with it, all thoughts, all beliefs were suppressed, and I became a slave to this book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that the expedition suffered heavy losses." The news Suger had heard in Albert's mouth before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini said with awkwardness: "Of course, our entire brigade has died there, only I am alone. That is, since then, I became a little priest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This book has extraordinary magic, it controls me to come back, actually passed all mystery detection and Will determine that the Holy See, and even the saints think that I am a cowardly coward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the time, it seems to be constantly passing through my body I learned all the knowledge of the world. After half a year, I suddenly recovered my control over the body, and the previous book that had not been a few pages became like this."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge reached out and touched the cover of the book, whispering: "It has the ability to evolve through knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's just a side effect of its core capabilities." Sini took a deep breath and said casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Suger’s quirky gaze, Cagnes did not directly say: “It’s core competence is deduction and linking. It can link almost everything in the world. Let things that should have nothing to do with a strange relationship. This brainless link is useless, but when there is enough knowledge to fill the deduction, the relationship and truth will appear." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I began to think that it was a gift from the March goddess, but when I saw the content, I found that this is not a gift, but a world. On the most vicious curse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Father Cagne leaned on the couch, looking at the purple moon with a pathological madness in his eyes , muttered: "It is He who takes control of me out of arms, appease me, educate me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
