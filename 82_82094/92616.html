			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Suge woke up from her dreams, she found her body very comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain before it still exists, but it has been reduced a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially the most prominent is that the blisters and ulcers in his cavity have recovered, and the control of the body has recovered a large part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening his eyes on the bed next to the bed, he felt that the surroundings were so clear and clear, like a person with myopia. Brought a pair of glasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Su Ge was ready to look around, he suddenly found the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because at this moment, he suddenly found his spiritual vision to grow five points! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, came directly from ten o'clock at fifteen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My day! What the hell is going on?" Seeing this, Su Ge’s heart flashed a shudder, even a faint fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you saw it, heard it, or knew something you shouldn’t have seen, the probability of going crazy was very high while the vision was skyrocketing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most typical is the former corrupt patrolman Louis, who has grown a madness by about 12 points in a single time, and will never have the possibility of replying again. Sex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did I see? How could it suddenly rise by five points??" Su Ge’s head began to transfer quickly, thinking about the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a huge grievance? No, I didn't see its form, and when the grievances died, my vision was There is no growth. What is it? The three most powerful monsters in the sequence are only two priests who have grown up. I have seen what I have seen, and my spiritual vision has grown by five points!?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, Su Ge’s heart became anxious from the happiness he had just recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it the red shadow in the dream? It is not very likely. It is something within my consciousness. What can be in my consciousness can make my spiritual vision soar!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, this kind of vision is growing in my sleep, and the burden on my willpower is not heavy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"So, what did I see!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a while, Su Ge felt his head start to sting again, he rushed to use meditation Rumors appease their anxiety and darkness: "I don't want to understand this thing. After the recovery, study it carefully."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚...咚...... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some fuzzy bells came from outside the building, and when he heard the thick bells, Su Ge’s spirit was inexplicably relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard this low and thick bell feel like listening to soothing music. Is my hobby a bit weird?" Su Ge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒......啪嗒......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, extremely subtle footsteps came After the footsteps, there is a slight gentle breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing these sounds, Su Ge suddenly felt some slight ripples in front of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These ripples are transmitted from different angles, from large to small, thin and thick, and in various shapes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a sound wave!?" Su Ge runs the psionic power in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, these ripples are simultaneously received through the eyes and ears of Suger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twenty meters away from me, there is a door in between. The material of the door should be a high-density compacted solid wood door." Su Ge’s mind Suddenly analyzed a lot of intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the ward opened silently, and Sug turned his head and passed through the bed, blurring the sight of a man in white clothes coming over here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listening to the gasping voice is Father Hank." Su Ge analyzed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After thinking about it, Su Ge found that his ability to control the knowledge of sound seems to have been enhanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the one hand, it is the improvement of the soul, let me see something new. On the other hand, it should be the improvement of physical fitness. Now the ears and eyes should be It’s a lot better than before.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, the bed squats gently, and the kind face of Father Hank appears, seeing Su Ge at this time When I looked like, I said with satisfaction: "Now you are just like a new life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his arm and squeezed his palm and said, "Yes. I feel very strong now. Thank you, priest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Hank sat down and said, "This is my duty, you don't have to thank me. If you want Thank you, thank you for the generosity of Bishop Ron and the importance that Master Geros pays to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said: "But after taking care of me, you are "Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hank looked at the very close-up Su Ge, laughing and said: "Those who are grateful will always be fortunate." < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Hank bent over to take out the box he had taken, and took a bottle filled with milky white from the middle and hung it aside, ready to continue Suger performs intravenous infusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What blood is this time?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hank said with a skilled operation: "It is black bear blood with the deer blood, they can add enough energy to your body. Although your mouth has recovered But the tissue burned by the potion in the esophagus and stomach is not completely healed and cannot be eaten. This bottle of blood can give you the energy needed for about two days of activity. At that time, the wound has recovered almost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the veins of the needle that pierced his arms and sighed: "Blood therapy, it’s amazing."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hank fixed the needle with gauze and said, "Yeah, every time I give blood healing to others, my heart is always screaming. Such outstanding ideas and ideas are really people." Can the thinking be achieved?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
