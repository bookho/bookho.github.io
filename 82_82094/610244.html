			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group-style attack is terrifying, especially with the support of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meteor shower lasted for five minutes before the order of Su Ge was calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, everything in front of Su Ge disappeared, leaving only a lot of residual thunder and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at this time the one of the gods has been nailed to the ground by several thunderbolts, although it is constantly struggling, but it has no use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really weak," Su Ge said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few waves that seem to be eccentric are not regular mysterious battles, but the collision of theocracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people have the right to control the dream, it can be said that the competition and control of the entire dream world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, Su Ge won with an overwhelming advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley suddenly said: "Your vocabulary is really poor, which is very boring compared to your human condition."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Shen Ming Su Ge was physically stiff and actually felt a bit blocked in his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The god does not need language." Su Ge stunned for a long time and said such a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl's mouth tilted slightly, seemingly very satisfied with the appearance of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless knights who have descended from the sky and worshipped around Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly, came forward to the Son of God, looked down at the deformed child that was almost as big as his palm, and said with disdain in disdain: There is no need to continue to survive this kind of garbage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mouth, Su Ge did not start killing him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reading that you are still useful, now feel kindness." Saige, Su Ge raised his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numerous mists and frosts have condensed into five chains with spikes that are directly wrapped around the body of the Son of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spurs of the scorpion pierced into his body, and the chain wraps its whole body, looking very cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entangled god seems to feel a huge crisis, the body is constantly struggling, and the mouth emits a burst of threatening screams, but there is no way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, He has been completely suppressed at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl asked: "How are you going to deal with it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going back Tune it, then turn it into a helper in the world," Su Ge said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You want to bring it down?" Shelly stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug replied: "Of course, how can the bug die vigorously?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When I heard this, Shirley asked: "After dying?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturely let it become a human. But at that time, it is not The god of Cthulhu, but my god," Su Ge said lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Shirley frowned slightly: "You want to take it as a child!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge just want to answer, but found that the direct answer is not appropriate, faintly said: "It is not a child, can be understood as a demon, it is not qualified to be my son."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Shirley nodded with satisfaction: "This is almost the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bring back to the Kingdom of God. Said Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside, a knight came over respectfully, carrying the trapped son, and turned and left after respecting the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the departure of the Son of God, Su Ge gained full control of the entire space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turned around and looked at the people in the fog, saying freely: "The farce is over, go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people return to God, they find themselves lying on the ground, just like falling asleep, just like everything, just experienced Some unspeakable nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone feels that their spirits are not very good. It seems that they are as tired as not sleeping for a few days, and they are very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke first stood up, looked around in shock, and then nodded in peace after seeing Su Ge and Shirley. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treading on the ground, I feel that everything is so real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point he knew that the nightmare had completely ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert and Ieta stood together, sluggishly looking at the two people who looked calm and talked to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They...solved the gods!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stimuli, as if they were listening Saying a newborn baby, a real world champion is killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of two people, Su Ge turned to look at two people and waved a few gestures at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert took the lead in returning to God and hurriedly nodded his consent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Su Ge disappeared into the hall when the people had not completely returned to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert hurried out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I walked out of the hall, I found that the day was already bright. The deep dive on the deck had disappeared, and the eccentric statue disappeared, leaving Drake lying there, looking very weak and fainting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Save all people, no interest in fame and fortune, deep possession of power and name, this kind of discouragement, this kind of volume..." Albert is full of awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hurriedly picked up Drake, walked in and met with a confused Macock, and quickly conveyed the meaning of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock immediately nodded after listening, and said with a look of shock and awe: "Mr. Assassin, a true hero!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge was comfortable lying in bed, and he was tired enough this night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing is to be handed over to Albert and Markock. He believes that these two people will perfectly settle the incident and then follow his meaning. , Drake is shaped as a hero who saves himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly took off her clothes and put the clothes back into the box and lay down in Su Ge’s arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned and hugged her, buried her face in the hair of her shoulder, breathing calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly felt the hot gasp and asked him in his arms: "You seem to be thinking about something."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugen nodded a little, then lifted up and suddenly said: "The conversation in our dreams reminds me of one thing."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at her seriously and asked, "How do we want a child?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very clear that Shirley’s deep dissatisfaction and hostility when he mentioned the Son of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he thought about it for a moment, and suddenly it came up with this unreliable idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl heard that it was completely stunned, it seems that Su Ge’s plan is completely beyond all her imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
