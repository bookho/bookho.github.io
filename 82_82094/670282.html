			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ps: This chapter has been written for four hours, while reading and reading the outline, the whole story is a foreshadowing, buried a lot of things. Please watch it carefully.) <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name is a symbol, but its meaning is to prove the existence of a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legacy and old things left over from that era cannot be properly integrated into the present world, so the meaning of existence is especially important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As before, everything that Shirley did was to prove his existence and integrate himself into the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Shirley has the help of Su Ge and succeeded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this old king, because of the loss of the name, caused the existence of the whole person to be illusory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can’t integrate into the world, and naturally I can’t get feedback from the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading the contents of the book in silence, the old king waved his hand and returned the page to Ada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you seen, another one?" asked the old king suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada is silent, and I don’t know how to answer it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cause and effect of the two exist in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous two people did not have any intersections, and they did not even know who the other party was. But the depths of inspiration are telling myself that the other person has an important relationship with himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada had some pre-existing things that made him contact the old king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, its cause and effect are already doomed at birth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven't seen it yet." Ada shook her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king leaned back on the chair and looked up at the sky and said, "I have seen that it is a completely different self. I am at somewhere. Another important choice in time, another possibility chosen by fate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this the reason you survived?" Ada asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king did not answer and continued: "It is the breath of the stars, the god is the anchor of the storm and the end. The border of the world, the situation of the other side, The coordinates of the world are fixed. In the body, the god is outside. All the filthy things are cast into my dark armor. All the radiance is condensed into her shining cloak."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be telling something important, but because it doesn't have a head or tail, people can't understand the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Ada is not a mortal, she flashed a brilliant light in her eyes, and smiled: "It turns out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king seems to take back his gaze and look down at Ada: "There are two words in the skull of the ancient gods. The extremes of the matter must be reversed. Nothing is very good. There is no balance in the world forever, nor is it forever tilted. The ground. Want to spend the night, escape all death, only in the two extremes, can be balanced against immortality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Not afraid of death," Ada said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This has nothing to do with life and death. It only relates to your original will." The words of the old king are very confusing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada is silent again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your relationship, okay?" For a long time, Ada asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s rare to see a sigh in the old king’s tone: “I don’t know. In this broken memory, we have never seen each other.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, it’s better not to see." Ada suddenly had a dim face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are different from me." The old king suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the difference?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a person, you are not a person." Old King Say something funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada pinches his fists, his brows are locked, and his head is contemplative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whenever things in the world become two halves, no matter how they make up, there will be cracks. It is impossible to return to the previous roundness. But there are some extraordinary things that are doomed. They do not have flesh, their concept of existence, even The special nature of time, even if it is split into countless copies, is placed in the long river of the ages, and when the time is ripe, it can still be one thing and one element."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Ada sighed: "I am still hesitating."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still have the right to think and choose, I have no more." Although calm, there is a sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that something important has been lost and can never be taken back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big hall suddenly fell into a repressed silence at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada does not speak, the old king is also silent, seems to have fallen asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Left thinking and thinking about Ida farewell to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaving, the old king called Ada and said, "Your plan, I already know. If you want to continue, you have to deal with some legacy." Human waste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are locusts, vampires. They depend on all human beings to live. Those guys will not accept any change."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada heard this, a flash of indifference in his eyes: "I am also planning this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "All churches are not accidental. The gods are invisible and insane, but they do not mean that they are unaware. The immortal people pray for eternal life, but they are filthy and desperate."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada slightly sideways, looking at the old king on the throne: "You seem to be very interested in my plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The world has not changed for too long, I want to see the new colors." The old king replied casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada smiled and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she walked, she said: "There is time to go to the Elf Church to see it. The scenery there is indeed much better than here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king did not speak, But Ada faintly heard the blunt friction, as if the bone was rubbing against the stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without looking back, she already knew that it was the friction between the skirt and the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king has stood up from the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The missing name is not meaningless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king of today may be able to leave here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the palace, the ankles stepped on this dark land, Ada looked calm, expressions kindly, and looked tenderly at the front: "The next look at you The little guy. Over the countless years, can you break the limits of this world and bring the gods to the world again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The body turned into a radiance and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the palace, the old king has indeed stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petite body seems to be only one meter and fifty, less than one meter six. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has spanned countless years of getting up and excited by countless knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the knights on the palace are on the ground and welcome their king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark clouds in the sky of the night are never rolling, and it seems to indicate that something big is going to happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The depths of a mountain in the north wind continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who live here don’t know when they have suddenly found a huge mountain in the mountains. The mountain should be three hundred meters. Covered with snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain looks strange, it seems to be a dragon that is upside down, revealing a strange and more spectacular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
