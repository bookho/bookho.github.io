			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss looked at the contemplative Su Ge and asked, "What are your plans for next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge blinked his eyes and said truthfully: "There is not much planning yet, just want to make money to support the family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents’ compensation I have already seen the bottom half a year ago. The main income in the past six months is that Winnie and Black are working part time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has no income from this waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You graduated from the history department of Bain University. You chose to refuse when you graduated. You have no work experience for six months now. Now you think you can What kind of job did you find?” Gerlos said slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge heard this face change, his attitude is somewhat overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History is a subject that looks very tall but has no practical use. After graduation, you want to earn a good income and you can only stay with the school to follow the professor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monthly salary for this period will be around 10 kr. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lanke is the monetary unit of the Empire. Since the Bertrand Empire is the gold standard, Langke is directly linked to gold, so the purchasing power is very strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple conversion, Su Ge estimates that the purchasing power of Lange is about 300 RMB. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monthly salary of 10 francs is 3,000 yuan, and the salary is almost equivalent to a newly graduated intern<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After accumulating certain experience, at least three to five years later, there is an opportunity to become the official teacher of the school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you become a formal teacher, Su Ge’s monthly salary can get 40 francs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current situation of the empire, the monthly income of 40 francs, has barely entered the threshold of the middle class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a pity that Su Ge was obsessed with mystery and refused this opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking before thinking, Su Ge said bitterly: "Now I have the opportunity to enter the newspaper to do internship editing, or join the ranks of workers."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just graduated from a theory without practice, dispensable professional knowledge, without any work experience, Su Ge can only think of doing work, or go to the newspaper to do some The hardest and most tiring work of text editing and typesetting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of work is not getting the monthly salary, it is calculated according to the daily salary, because if the performance is not good, people can fire you at any time, and there is no labor contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daily salary is only a poor 10 francs (100 rang equals 1 gram), which is equal to 30 wages per day on the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this concept? This kind of income, Su Ge's income for a month can barely eat, without any balance, he will lose all the capital of amateur life and interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can still recognize your level." Gerlos nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The graduates who have just graduated are generally very upset, and they have a lot of big dreams in their hearts, and they are later beaten by reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this Su Ge can clearly recognize his position, which makes Jackos very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Ge was depressed in his heart, his thoughts did not stop turning. Just a series of words from Gerlos were very meaningful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his ability to show up before, Su Ge suddenly thought: "Does he want to pull me into the church to become a demon hunter!?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge’s heart was hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus’s insight is very sharp. After seeing the hotness in Su Ge’s eyes, he said faintly: “It’s impossible to become a demon hunter. You need to start training from an early age, and take a lot of potions with toxins to improve your body and finally eliminate all feelings. You are too late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suggton, who was said to be through, had a red face and a distressed face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But your ability to perform is very suitable for being a psychic." Gerlos continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Psychic media? Is it the kind of psychic person who communicates with the soul?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos nodded and said, "Almost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge silenced and raised himself most One point of concern: "How much salary can I get after becoming a psychic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Warren flashed a weird question: "Listen At this point, you don't care about the dangers and details of this profession, but ask this directly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge screamed and said: "I It’s really very short of money. I have two younger brothers who are going to college.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss said directly: “After testing, the trial period is two In the month, the monthly salary is 15 francs, and after 25 km, there are extra traffic and meal allowances. The total is about 28 ng."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I am doing!" Su Ge heard this without hesitation, said directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss is very insightful and faint: "It seems that you care about your family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Yes, I feel very embarrassed to them." Su Ge said honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss calmly said: "The psychic media does not have a formal title. On the one hand, the psychic media can be understood as a police detective, responsible for the investigation of the case. And screening. The location of the work is here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warren added: "But don't underestimate the job, psychic detectives generally They are the reserve of clergy. When you show enough stability and integrity in this position, you have the opportunity to enter the Holy See to become a clergyman. At that time, you will be incorporated into the Church of the Holy Blood, not only can the monthly salary reach 40. Langke, there are many church policy benefits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge said in his heart: "This is the gap between the auxiliary police and the police."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss continued: "There is another aspect, you seem I am very interested in mystery. Although you have not compiled it after becoming a psychic, it is also a church person. I can let you enter the mysterious path and let you choose your own career."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the relationship between career and mystery?" Su Ge blinked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the memory of Suger Sotos, there is no connection between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warren explained to the teacher: "The vast amount of knowledge is endless. Blind pursuit in it will not make any achievements in any way. Mystery is even more So, in order to make us more focused and more clear about our own path, the March goddess divides knowledge into countless lines, each line corresponding to a profession."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, the real role of the profession is to constrain its own spirit, so that you can study and perceive the mysterious knowledge of a certain aspect, which can greatly reduce the probability that you will go crazy when you see completely unknown knowledge. Greatly improve safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! This is like choosing a department when you go to college. After choosing the same, you will continue to develop in this direction. Go on," Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss nodded slightly and said: "Occupation is your guiding direction. It will tell you where you should go, and you will not be confused. Occupation is also the cohesion and embodiment of everything you learn, making you stronger and more focused, just like we are now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge smiled and said: "There is such a benefit, it is really good for me and nothing. I certainly agreed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss raised his legs A faint saying: "Don't worry, listen to me to finish the words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugton converges with a smile, a serious face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The benefits are over, then it's time to talk about risk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First first Point, do you know why I am so anxious to pull you in?" Gerlos asked Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
