			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time, the entire misty mountain is undercurrent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three churches were nervously prepared, and at the same time, one after another orders were passed through the hands of the three archbishops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, more mysteries gather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, these mysterious people are mainly organizations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes the assassin of the Assassin League, the cultists of the Institute of Polar Studies, and some mercenaries of the mercenary nature, even the four mysterious colleges in the world. People are coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four mysterious colleges in the world are the Icecrown Institute in the depths of the North Wind Icefield; the Lingling University in the western mainland; the Lost in the Southern Islands The land of the secret law of the Eastern Continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four colleges were founded by four great sages, independent of all church systems, and a neutral institution for all people to confuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The college is mainly engaged in cultivating mysterious talents, although it is located outside the downtown area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four mysterious colleges can be said to be the backbone of the entire mysterious world today. They are associated with the Fortress, the Wolf Legion, and lead the joint church in March. The rules and boundaries of the most versatile mystery today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, the church was detached in March, and the focus was on the secular, and there was not much interference with the mysterious world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the core of the mysterious world is the mysterious union. In theory, as long as it is not the mysterious person of the clergy, it must go to the mysterious union to register. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mysterious guild behind the pushers and supporters, is the four major colleges and many other ancient mysterious organizations, including Barth's Green Flame Brotherhood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the mysterious guild and the church system are completely different, there is no distinction between righteousness and evil, female warlocks, cultists, and heretics are free to come and go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this is only in the territory of the mysterious union. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, Su Ge listened to Randall’s report and sighed: “The more troubles, the more the four colleges are coming, the more it’s said. It has become a big event that has drawn the attention of the whole mysterious world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lineup of the four major colleges and the church is flat, and the leaders are all master teachers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the four colleges are not fighting to win the battle, but to lead students to study and experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to the four major colleges, there are some mercenary groups and some mysterious organizations, the famous gray-bearded mercenary group, the hand of the gods, the Golden City, Windsurfers, Salomen, etc.,” Randall continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded, these names he had heard before, these are not sects, but those with a very long history, can be understood as the earth The world's top 500, has great influence and wealth in the mysterious world and society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These people are now talking to people in March to talk about something, I don't know what to say." Finally Randall said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg nodded with satisfaction: "It’s already very detailed, take a rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall obeyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s mind is thinking about the current situation and analyzing it: “Now the outside world still doesn’t know the Holy Grail of the soul, but only makes it a real The black goat's conspiracy treatment, which has a huge advantage for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, there are enough people in the city to die now, even if they can't Calling the Holy Grail completely, but it is okay to summon the base as the original sacrifice. Now it is very likely that they have already started the corresponding call."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am in the city Very familiar, and even Andrew's help, so that as long as we enter the city quietly, we can hide in the dark like a ghost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simply thinking about it, Suge closed his eyes and meditated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His spiritual power today is very big and needs to be restored as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When meditation, the black cloak on the side seems to have received another call, and began to creep slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then slowly approached and touched Su Ge’s leg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meditation of Su Ge felt a huge distortion in the space of meditation, a sense of weightlessness that made people very uncomfortable suddenly came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, he felt like he was going to a familiar place with terrible horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, he saw countless bodies, saw the dilapidated city, saw the dark fire, and saw the way to seven directions. The road is full of strange bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old dream of the ancient city!" Seeing this, Su Ge was surprised, and the spirit began to struggle fiercely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows how terrible this place is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he seems to be tied to the old dream of the ancient city at this time, no matter how he struggles, he can’t break free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘎吱!嘎吱......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sound of footsteps, the seven horrors of armor are gradually approaching here, and Suge feels that he is about to be taken by the seven The momentum of the horror exists to be crushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key moment of desperation, Su Ge suddenly felt the body warm, a pair of soft and delicate hands grabbed his wrist, suddenly mentioning, Su Ge I felt that I was pulled out of the water and I entered a beautiful place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be a valley, surrounded by lush greenery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lake that is as calm and clear as a mirror. There is a white waterfall far away, and the faint sound of water flows from there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is on the shore, the lower body of the body is still soaked in the water, wearing a rough and very embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that something is playing with the sound of the water, Su Ge heard the turn and saw a pair of beautiful white jade feet, along with the holy The legs slide gently over the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up the leg, Su Ge saw the familiar white, familiar holiness, familiar face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ada?" Su Ge looked at the beautiful fairy who was close at hand and blinked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White 皙 fingers hold the dark hair behind the ear, the beautiful side of the face with mature sexy appeared in front of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little guy, I haven't seen you for a long time." Ada's voice is still as soft as before, making people feel comfortable and soulful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sat on the grass on the shore and looked at Ada's beautiful face, but there was no heart in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here is the world of Byron's travels?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aida nodded slightly: "Well, this is another page, this valley is beautiful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Su Ge looked around and nodded and fell silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you seem to have something to worry about?" Ada's two ankles fiddled with the lake, the white, soft, smooth toes move gently, sometimes rising, sometimes clasping Feet, white flowers look at Su Ge somewhat ecstasy, as if this pair of feet is the most perfect art in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pair of jade feet touched and made a crisp sound, pulling Su Ge back from the scorpion to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing, Su Ge asked: "How have you been recently?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Da's fingers fiddled with water waves: "Alright, those people's attention is attracted by the ancient city, I am a lot easier here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Aida's side face, Su Ge feels that Ada is the most perfect and beautiful woman in the world, just like a goddess who has reached perfection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada seems to have noticed Su Ge’s gaze and even felt what he thought in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raise your hand and gently hold Su Ge’s palm, smiled and said: "My little one has finally grown up."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's face is reddish: "I have grown up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what Suge looks like, how much Strong knowledge and lofty status, he will always be the lovely younger brother in front of Ada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s big hand held Ada’s hand and browed and asked: “Ada, what is the old dream of the ancient city? Who are the seven people? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada did not answer after listening, laughing and holding out his hands to help Su Ge's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not have any resistance, lie down slowly along her strength, her head resting on her lap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes look just above, just to see the perfect face with a smile and look at yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark long hair is scattered and put on his cheeks, some cool, itchy, very comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada reached out and gently stroked Sugg’s frowning brow and said, “You see, wrinkles are wrinkled.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling the contact between Ada’s fingers and the eyebrows, Su Ge’s comfort is coming out quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it’s fast, and it’s not really coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn’t forgotten his question at this time, just when he wants to ask again, Ada opens his mouth and smiles and says: “Those are. It belongs to your knowledge, and you have to take your own things back. After all, you have grown up, you can't rely on others for anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge After listening to the silence, I smiled and said: "Well, your knowledge really needs to be brought back by yourself. If it is told by others, it is the knowledge of others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
