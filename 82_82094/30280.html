			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing two poor witches is more real and more miserable than what you see in your dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge felt a sullen chest, and once again determined that there was no one nearby, jumped in and re-covered the door panel and walked down the steps and said, "Hello, self. To introduce, my name is Suge Sotos. It is the apostle of the Lord of Death and Storm in this world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman with blue hair is covered : "Oh, my name is Sears Bartos, a loyal servant of the Lord of Death and Storm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purple girl said: "My name is Bernice Sagur, the loyal servant of the Lord of Death and Storm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded slightly, opened the box in his hand and said, "The witch is now You are very clear about the status, my lord is unable to interfere with human affairs, and I can't give you too good conditions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two poor girls forced to think To see what is in the box, I nodded happily: "I know, the apostle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug The box was completely opened, and while taking out the things inside, he said, "This is the two coats of my family's cold clothes. You should wear them first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills And Bernice looked at the two thick coats and said with enthusiasm: "Thank you for the gift of my Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After picking up the coat, 匍匐on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has a bit of a distressed saying: "You two don't have to be like this. The great death is different from the Lord of the Storm and other gods. He pays more attention to it. It is the piety and faith in the heart, and does not care about these superficial things. emmm... My Lord once told me that true piety should be in real and effective action, not in hypocritical rituals and prayers."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Su Ge had a new understanding of his ability to compile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s incredible to hear the faces of these two girls, because such gods are completely different from what they see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge said with a smile: "So get up, and afterwards, you will be more admired and admired after receiving the gift. You don't have to be as skeptical and useless as other believers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two girls nodded hard, stood up seriously, the expression on the face was more devout, and even fanatic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get on your clothes and eat!" Su Ge said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two girls returned to God and hurriedly put on their warm coats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling a thick, heavy feeling on the body, the two people suddenly feel the warmth that can't be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s side continues to take other things out and say: “I didn’t bring anything else, it’s two pounds of gray bread, and there’s fish. Canned food and butter. Don't have a psychological burden. This is the return of your devout faith. Eat it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two girls walked over and were The frozen red hand trembled over the bread and looked at the soft gray bread, leaving tears unconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than three years, they have relied on rubbish and food thrown away by others to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They haven’t eaten such decent food for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eat!" Su Ge handed over the canned food and butter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for the gift of my Lord, thank you for your compassion, the apostle." The two girls finished and began to gorge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very happy to see two people grateful for eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is always a very happy thing to help others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge thinks of taking out two cups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My master said that you wear very little. I think that if there are very few words, the body is estimated to be frozen, and bring a pot of boiling water. You should drink a cup of warmth and warmth."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge poured the boiling water of warm steam into the cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two girls who have eaten half of the bread see this, can’t help but open it, cry out loud, like that, it seems to have been wronged. I can't help but cry when I see my parents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If food and clothing are the gifts of the gods, then this pot is a very ordinary pot of boiling water, that is, the apostle adults are really concerned about the two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many years, they finally felt the warmth of being cared for by others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜呜呜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people holding glasses and feeling the glass The warmth, I cried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tears ran along the sallow, the dirty face continued to slide down, this kind of gratitude, this kind of grievance, so that Su Ge looked very distressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, thank you for your kindness and kindness." This is not the Lord of Death and Storm, but Su Ge himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said with a smile: "We are all my people, and mutual help is appropriate. Drink it hot and warm your body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time, quiet and timely eating time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two girls are drinking warm water while eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After eating the bread, the two men still reluctantly licked the crumbs in the bag and the bottom of the can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has some heartfelt feelings to turn over and ask his thoughts: "Yes, what is your ability as a witch?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every witch will awaken different abilities. This ability can be released directly without occupation and cultivation, which is equivalent to innate power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills looked amazed: "I told you my identity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squinted and said, "Oh, what?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict’s slender hand hugged the cup and whispered, “Are you not afraid of us?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sug smiled and said: "What are you afraid of? You are not a descendant of a demon, nor a sly monster. You are just two poor girls."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people heard this suddenly wide-eyed and unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't think too much, my master has already seen your truth, he and I said: They are not blasphemy, just some ordinary people who are mutated, As long as you get proper control, you are no different from normal people.” Su Ge couldn’t think of anything too lyrical, so he took out the “Head of Death and Storm” in the back pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, two people are wide-eyed, and their expressions are filled with happiness and light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because their existence has finally been recognized and recognized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They feel that their inner world filled with haze is instantly illuminated by this light, and the inferiority and fear that have suppressed for many years are completely dissipated. The world is full of bright sunshine and fresh air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They feel that they have entered a new world, a beautiful and bright world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Lord! Thank you, my Lord!" The two men did not bow down and bowed, but bent down deeply to express their admiration and admiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pot of open water, the two people's frozen white face has restored some blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two also talked about their abilities in succession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills has a strong ability, her body has been greatly enhanced, and the body surface can also produce scales as hard as scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
