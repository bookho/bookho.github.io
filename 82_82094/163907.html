			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March calendar January 1, 7845, heavy snow, the temperature is minus 22 degrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, Su Ge, who came back from the morning exercise, just saw Ada wearing a white plush top and a clean, light blue dress on his lower body to clean the table at home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ada, it has been wiped out yesterday, no need to wipe it again." Su Ge took off his coat and picked up a towel and wiped the sweat from his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is the festival of the moon, two people came back yesterday to clean up the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada smiled and said: "When you see some dirty, you can wipe it. Today is the festival of the moon. The goddess of the moon is a goddess of pure symbolism. We both It’s a clergyman, you have to lead by example!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took off his thin shirt and showed his strong upper body and smiled: “I know, so I decided to go again. Take a shower!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing in front of the mirror in the bathroom, Su Ge raised his arms and looked at the raised muscles, his face satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been seventeen days since I officially joined the church on December 13. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventeen-day Suggs only went home, and the rest of the time was spent on training and learning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past seventeen days, Su Ge has only slept for five hours a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get up in the morning at five in the morning, eat at six o'clock, then read a book and see lunch at twelve. After lunch for one hour after lunch, it is used to digest the knowledge that I saw in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Footing practice at 1:30 pm, ending at four o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rest for half an hour, continue learning at 4:30, lasting until 7pm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hour of muscle exercise from seven to eight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dinner, eat a pound of beef, then continue to study after 9 minutes after proper post-meal exercise, continue to sleep until 12 o'clock, then wake up at 5 o'clock a new day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge, who races every day, even counts the time to minutes. How many meters to go back and forth every day, how long it takes, and the score of Su Ge is not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This meticulous state of life lasted for sixteen days, and the results were unprecedentedly large. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the training of the church expert-level fighters, Su Ge’s close combat and his ability to use the body have been greatly improved, and the scientific exercise Coordinated with the balanced nutrition allocated by the church, Su Ge's physical fitness has advanced by leaps and bounds. During the period, even Hank priest entered the blood twice to restore the muscle damage he developed during his training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these three aspects of blessing, Su Ge’s physical condition is now at least twice that of the previous Su Ge. The overall battle preparation is at least four times more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as the physical progress, Su Ge’s knowledge reserve is also advancing at a speed dozens of times more than the physical progress of the horror, or even every day. Great changes have taken place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the processor of the gods, Su Ge does not even need to go through the brain to see things, just need to trace the contents of it in a single line, then through the dream The analysis of the body of the gods, everything will be integrated, no matter how difficult the problem, in the eyes of the gods seems to be as simple as 1+1 equals 2. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of opening speed is very cool, and even produces a unique pleasure, so that Su Ge has an addictive feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than half a month, the thousand-page thick book Su Ge has read a total of twenty-five books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes a day and a half to finish reading at the beginning, and becomes more skilled as time progresses. At the end, you can read two books a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This covers religion, history, geography, ergonomics, occultism, formation, materials, alchemy, potions, monsters, secret treasures, mysterious costumes, hypnosis , mechanical engineering, and many other disciplines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although all of this knowledge is still in the theoretical stage, there is a lack of hands-on, but after a lot of simulations by the gods, Su Ge has now opened his mouth. Near instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, such growth is not without cost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, Su Ge feels that his brain capacity has temporarily saturated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From yesterday, the continued intake of knowledge Su Ge will have a strong sense of dizziness, vomiting, nausea and other symptoms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After analyzing, Su Ge found that his physical brain could not load so much knowledge for a while and temporarily entered the saturation stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the passage of time, after continuous use, the brain is developed and fully absorbed before the next stage of learning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The brain is used more and better, but at this speed, the filling speed is definitely much slower than the development speed. It is like When watching a video when the network is not good, the progress bar often catches up with the buffer bar, causing the video card master. In the case where the hardware cannot be improved, the only way is to pause and wait for the new buffer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;揉 For the forehead, Su Ge has a feeling of being very heavy at this time, which is the sequela of saturation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling disappears, and the "buffering" that represents the brain goes forward a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After showering, Su Ge put on a white shirt and a glamorous new tuxedo, combing his hair neatly, putting on his boots, a handsome young man Appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This handwork, this material is really good, this 2 Langke flower is very worth!" Ada looked at the subtle lines of Su Ge's neckline, and looked satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said: "Ready, the celebration show seems to have begun, we are looking for a good location."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everything is ready, Ada rarely takes off her nuns when she goes out and puts on a white plush coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge symbolizes wearing a new coat, wearing a black silk material and a top hat with gold embroidered edges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing black leather gloves, and finally picking up his cane, the two went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
