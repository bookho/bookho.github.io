			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Suge woke up, he found himself lying in a white ward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The physical pain has weakened a lot, only a slight sting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, looking at the white ceiling, Su Ge did not rush to move his body, but to determine his current state of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The spirit and psionics have replied, but 50% of the psionics are still locked. It seems that there is no way for at least one or two months. It’s recovered.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., are you awake!?" At this moment, a light and happy voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned his head and saw that in a white sportswear, the face was ruddy and he looked at himself with pleasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long have I been in a coma?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills said directly: "Seventy-four Hours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she added: "At that time, your state really frightened us. I heard Master Mill, if you didn't take it with you. With two advanced blood medicines to help you stop bleeding and stabilize your injuries quickly, you are in danger at the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened in other situations? What else is there?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills smiled and shook his head: "No, the rest of the embers have been cleaned up by Randall."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those citizens who become werewolves?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are some flaws in the rushed pharmacy, Master Mill according to the blood of the werewolf The antidote was studied the next day. But when it was about to be used, it was stopped by the Queen, and now only the drugs that are going to restore reason. The whole city has changed back to normal form."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge nodded with satisfaction and raised his hand to indicate that he was helping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills hurried forward and held Sugg to let him sit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Should you be busy these days?" Su Ge bowed his hands and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills nodded: "Yeah, too many things need to be dealt with, while to appease the people, while preparing to pay the remaining strength of the Duke of the Mountain Range in the country." But it's okay, the nobles are now absolutely loyal to Her Majesty the Queen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these nobles, Hills has some admiration on his face: "These corrupt guys are usually very hateful, but at this critical moment, everyone really has a good ability. After the Queen's deployment, all the nobles mobilized, repaired the house, formed the city guard, and released it. Announcement overnight, integrating resources from other parts of the country, dealing with private law, financial situation, getting the order, the whole incident has subsided in three days, the damage in the city has been repaired by 60%."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge smiled and said: "The reason why the nobles are aristocrats is for a reason, even if it is a waste of waste, in the kind of education, you can master some Know how Little effort, achievement will go far beyond civilian families "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;".. That's not fair, "Hills muttered loudly, his face with a trace of unhappiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two chat, the ward door is opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then put on his pajamas again, and regained the smile of Mil with his assistant, Marvel, coming in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the situation has recovered well." After seeing Su Ge's temperament, Mil smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s response nodded and asked: “How is my physical condition now?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mille Come over and stretch your hand and swipe twice on Su Ge's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The trauma and internal organs are almost restored, but the broken bones are not easy. You will be in a wheelchair this month." Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squinted: "So serious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think? Your body bones are broken by a third, including your leg bones, ribs, cheekbones, and even the spine and lumbar bones. You are so dangerous to sit here now, I suggest you lie well within the last five days. Otherwise, the spine is misplaced, and you are well received."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;referring to the spine, this can scare Suge enough, with the help of Hills Lying on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several people talked to each other about the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in the entire Guinness Kingdom is now very good and the overall situation is booming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of the nobility, Vanas not only completely recovered the capital, eradicated all the secret enemies, but also recovered all the satellite cities outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately the death of the Duke of the Mountain, the Queen’s message of all the aristocratic counterattacks was instantly transmitted to the entire country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this message, there are a lot of newspapers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experienced the horror of becoming a werewolf, the bosses, editors, and journalists of these newspapers spontaneously wrote about the collusion between the Duke of the Mountain and the cult. The ones written in the vinegar are called real and detailed, as if they were all personal experiences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blame for this difficult book is reported by all the most authoritative newspapers in the country. During the three days, all the residents were completely brainwashed by this overwhelming report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spell the Duke of the Mountain Range, and the brave and brave Queen is already a daily job for the nation's residents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this wave of public opinion, the army of the Dukes of the mountains stationed in other places directly collapsed and surrendered. And a small number of diehard party members who are planning to bear stubborn resistance are not dead in the hands of their own people who want to invite meritorious work, or they are dead in the hands of the aristocrats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, even Vanas did not shoot, it completely collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conversation, Su Ge knows from Mill’s mouth that Vanas intends to leave the werewolf form of everyone in the capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Duke of the Mountain is dead, the curse still exists. Even if these people do not become werewolves, their children will have high probability of mutation in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, it is better to let them adapt to this power as early as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The control of these werewolves is naturally the source of the Werewolf curse, Prince Jean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the newspaper’s amnesty report, Prince Jean’s monster from the uncle’s father became the most pitiful and most tragic person in the whole incident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the fifth edition of the prince of Prince Jean, people did not have any hate for this prince, but they were very pity and like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a general understanding of these situations, Mill and others left, and Hills followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summoning of the Son of the Great God is not a trivial matter, although it is sufficiently concealed, it also causes dramatic mysterious fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is a large number of surrounding magical and Yi people gathered here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These few mysteries are the core guards of the entire city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After everyone left, Su Ge was lying in bed quietly, and slept unconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he wakes up again, he sees the soft light, the sky is already full of stars, the moonlight shines through the window on the floor, like a layer of light Frost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he woke up, he first felt a warm gasp and made his skin itch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turned around and saw the Vanas wearing a black creole skirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black lace has a low chest collar, revealing her half shoulder and delicate and beautiful clavicle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment she held her hands and smiled at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I look good?" Su Ge asked with a slight opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas puts his hand down and sits upright: "Of course it looks good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge Looking at the room, they looked at the two of them and asked: "I heard that you are very busy. Now sitting here and looking at me silly, shouldn't it be more than just greeting me?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas sighed in his heart: "I actually want to come over and see you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Pope’s message She will certainly not say this unspoken words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gradually converges on the expression of the right color: "The Pope, now Guinness has become the home of the werewolf, in which case each of us is a mystery In this way, you can have great self-defense ability. I think that you should put the Holy See church in the evening church here. It should be a very safe place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly "Well, you and I thought about it together. In the future, this country is the base camp of our church, and we will expand it from here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Vanas excitedly: "If this is the case, then I will start to bring the nobles into the church, which will greatly guarantee the security and cohesion of the entire country."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To ensure trust, and never betray." Su Ge reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can rest assured that this is fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, the Pope. I I already know about our ancestors and the Church of the Holy Blood. I have discussed this with the ministers and nobles these days. We think it is a good time to ask for help from the Church of the Holy Blood. This will not only lead this matter to the Holy Blood. Church, we can also get a lot of resources. After confirming, you can not only become the regional bishop here, but also have the authority to develop independently. The church will also build a Cathedral of the Holy Blood here to control you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly nodded and said: "I am also planning this, but the problem now is to ensure that you are a witch, and that these people will not be revealed as a werewolf." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
