			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, Su Ge has a basic understanding of the situation in the capital city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really internal and external troubles!" Su Ge looked at the sky, and his heart was awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a situation, he is not sure if he can help Vanas get rid of the dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilna looked at Su Ge’s look and asked: "You asked so much, and said that you are a businessman?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge grinned: "Of course, the main purpose of my visit this time is to promote a raise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, I see how long you can lick me." Elena shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At ten o'clock in the morning, just halfway through the road, there was a burst of smoke in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked up and saw a large group riding a horse, and the man with the weapon rushed towards it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Robber! It’s a robber!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The groom here is squatting, from under the seat Take out the shotgun and ring the alarm bell that keeps quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, the entire team began to stir up quickly, and the grooms of the groom and the team took out their arms and prepared the battle with the car as a bunker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has some reaction to sitting on the goods, this is the first time he encountered a robber in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?" Sug turned to ask Elena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina spread the handkerchief: "Because you are blessed, you have the skills. I am not interested in using my power to help these in such conspicuous places." Ordinary people, not only do not get any good news, but even cause troubles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded, indicating that her choice was very wise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since you are an assassin, should it be easier to handle these things?" Elena asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squinted: "The assassin handles this scene simply? Who do you listen to? The assassin should be the least good at dealing with this kind of exposure to others. Fighting under and under the horizon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, aren't your assassins having the habit of killing all the witnesses? Killing a dozen people at once Even dozens of people. I have seen it in a book, saying that the assassin does not need any sneak, and that killing the witnesses is a perfect sneak, and that the weapon should use a combination of a sleeve sword and a giant sword. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"........." Su Ge opened his mouth and didn't know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, he tempted and asked: "The book you read will not be "The Evening Clock of the Glen"?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina was shocked: "Hey! You know this book? I heard that this book contains the most advanced skills and secrets of the Assassin. After the sale, It was directly blocked by the Assassin League and burned 99%. Only a small amount of the remaining is still circulating in the world. It is a very rare assassin to the high secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge Silence Let’s say, “Don’t read the book in the future, it’s just a novel. How can the real assassin use this assassination?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the assassins I have seen are like this, aren't you?" Elena is struggling to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squinted: "Who told you that I am an assassin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Su Ge noticed that Elena actually regarded herself as an assassin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not an assassin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cheats!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people Your quarrel with me seems to have forgotten the robbers who are approaching quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two passengers above, if you have any method, use it quickly! It is not good to be caught by this group of animals, especially if you have such a beautiful female partner."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the ground, the driver behind the goods faintly heard the quarrel between the two people, shouting loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people on the top listened, Elena lie directly on the goods, said coldly: "Don’t count on me, I don’t mind the robbers killing first. These people, then I will kill the robbers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge whispered: "I didn't expect you to shoot."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, the body flexed from the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fat sheep, all give Laozi a honest point, otherwise I will let you all take the gun!" This group of robbers has about 30 people, holding in their hands It is actually a military semi-automatic pistol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are even grenades and firepower guns that can be seen on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge whispered to the driver's side and whispered, "Are you sure this is a robber, not an army?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver said with a wry smile: "In fact, this is a group of soldiers, you should know the system of private ship?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nod . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private ship was a despicable means used by the two countries in the fight for the right to maritime trade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The piracy legalization of the robbery, thereby destroying the other side of the merchant shipping trade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the surface, the Duke of the Mountain does not dare to attack the caravan, but some "flying soldiers" who become sobers are ok. He wants to want this way. Gradually monopolize the supply of supplies in the city, forcing the Queen to submit." The driver whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg nodded after listening, his eyes slowly swept around and found that the robbers were very experienced, about one meter apart, with a gun distance It is about ten meters away and will surround the entire team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give you ten seconds, and let the old man roll out and kneel on the ground, or our grenade will be thrown in." The head of the bandit who shouted loudly shouted and took a grenade from his waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?" The driver who gathered together on the inside suddenly panicked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go out! If they grab the goods, we can still live, or the grenade will be thrown in and die!" said a coachman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Innocent, do you really think that this group of beasts will let us go? I have heard that this group of soldiers have never lived!" The captain of the guard is low. Sound negation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What to do, I don't want to die!" The passenger in the convenient car was pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the farmer here is in a panic, two of his peers The businessman hurriedly walked over and said with respect and respect: "Respecting the great leader, we are just passing the passing merchants, not the caravans. Can you let us go? We are willing to offer our wealth." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, the two men took out a golden Langke, which looked about 30 or so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the other party is a middle-aged man with a big beard, a triangular eye, and a sullen face. He signals the men around him to take over the money, and counts the number to be true. Afterwards, they licked their heads at two people and signaled them to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people saw this happy, and hurriedly thanked and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are so kind!!" Su Ge saw this somewhat unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good intentions, they just want to disarm these people in this way, when these people really go out, hehe... ..." On the head, Elena’s disdainful voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, several drivers in the vicinity were in a cold, and the businessmen and coaches who had not heard in the distance hurriedly put down their arms and went out to prepare for surrender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't go out! Go out and die!" The guards rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
