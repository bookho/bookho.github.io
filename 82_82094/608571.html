			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere of strange repression continues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow wow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it has been, and a burst of harsh crying came from all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound is like a newborn baby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this crying is full of a hateful fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of crying, people imagined the baby in their minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a disgusting monster, the whole body was covered with tentacles, and the whole body was dark as if it were pus from the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be a monster, and it seems like a ghost baby who doesn’t know how long he has died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the sound makes everyone's heart tremble constantly, the soul trembles, there is an impulse to make people crazy and destroy everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, it is obvious that everyone in the room is wide-eyed at this time, the eyes are raised, and the bloodshot and blood clots on the eyeball are filled with water, as if The head was squeezed enormously and was about to be squeezed out of the eyes. It was very embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Albert and Iyeta trembled at this time, covering their ears with their hands, as if they were hearing the monster howling, weak and helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge’s voice sounded again: “Everyone is calm, we are all social elites, have rich knowledge and social experience, we should not be The fake tigers in these fantasies are intimidated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound has an indescribable magic, and if you listen carefully, you can even hear a small clock in the ending of the sound. sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the sound, people suddenly encountered water as soon as the burning wood met, and the thirsty person drank the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a comfortable feeling of washing that you want to pull out, people blinked and returned to calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those who recovered with these were Albert and Iyeta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this sound? What is this power?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, two The individual also felt the powerful magic of Su Ge's voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because after hearing this voice, all the negative emotions in the spirit of the two people are suppressed by a powerful force, smoothing, the spirit of the whole trembling fear is The mysterious power forced to calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound and crying are simply two opposite forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crying of the cry is to suppress the rationality of human beings, greatly awakening people's animal nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the looming bell is to completely suppress people's animal nature, to stabilize human reason in an absolute order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the current situation, the power used by Su Ge actually surpassed the cry of the god, and completely suppressed the cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible!?" Albert and Ieta looked at Su Ge at this moment with a shock and awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them even fear this mysterious existence more than ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they know more than the average person, they know the way to fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are we all right?" People looked around and looked at their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling just made them very scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the crying, they felt a violent force rushing into their heads, shutting their wills rudely, They took over their bodies and, under their gaze, quickly turned themselves from normal people into crazy beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as they were about to get mad, they heard the voice of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is like a declaration of the gods from the sky, let them force to calm down, forcibly expelling and smashing the barbaric beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this powerful command, their spirit quickly got rid of that crazy state, took back control of the body, and returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be ok!" Others touched their bodies without any change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This gentleman is too powerful!" Everyone cheered up again at this time, looking at Su Ge with both eyes, very excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they are too happy to be happy, just uplifting...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! Bang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly there was a horrible crash from the outside of the hall. It seems that there is something so great that the horrible thing is hitting the hull and rushing in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge then waved his hand, and the fog around him was like a conscious gathering, wrapping everyone in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This fog...what is it??"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugup and a steady voice came "This is the fog that protects you, and you don't want to move in peace. This nightmare is about to pass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear the voice of Su Ge Everyone suddenly felt a sense of stability inside, as if a scared child snuggled in his father's arms to get comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You also go in, the next situation, you can't afford it." Su Ge said to Albert, Duke, Iyeta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the two mysterious people nodded cleverly, and the storm filled the fog with their waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke looked at Su Ge and then smiled reluctantly: "Thank you again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Finished, rushed into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Su Ge and Shirley stood in the fog and looked at the scenery outside. Su Ge smiled: "It will finally appear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a burst, the ceiling of the entire hall suddenly broke open, and then several incomparably huge octopus tentacles came in from the top of the shed and raged in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the entire hall collapsed completely, and the massive sea waters rushed in with countless black-black monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The look of these monsters is unspeakable, but at a glance they know that they do not belong to the strange existence of this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the grayish fog seems to have entered a different world, those tentacles, those monsters can not touch them at all, can only pass through them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug raised his hand and the cane in his hand became a rifle with a thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a wave of his hand, he opened up a clean space directly in this dark and deep sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Light!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, and countless rays appeared in the dark, deep sea. Illuminate all the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Expulsion." Another calm and cold command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, the tentacles of the monsters near Su Ge were instantly flew out and could not get close to here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger is now burning two groups of ghosts and ghosts, looking forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, not far from the two people, in the middle of a group of deep-dive pilgrimages, Drake, who was fainting in the statue, was still there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time the statue is just like a living, surrounded by seven or eight hundred-meter-long terrorist tentacles extending from the statue, all around Surrounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
