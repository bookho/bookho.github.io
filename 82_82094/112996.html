			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at the complex array of scenes on the ground and felt a bit dazzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t see the logic and content of this array at all, and he couldn’t even see where this array began and where it ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he can only see the symbols of the dragon, the spire, the flame, the stars, etc., and the rest of the others do not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the procedure in the external code of ???, as for which external code, it is still not clear," said Gerlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"?" Sugton at the door of the door, he just felt a little embarrassed for a moment, the name that Gerlos had just said he did not hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss did not pay attention and continued to observe the magical array on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warren on the side noticed Suger’s anomaly and whispered: “There are some nouns or words that are from the ancient language or before the Kabatos College. The ancient language that was circulated a long time ago. These languages ​​were translated from the aftermath of the voice of the gods and have powerful mystical powers. According to their different abilities and status, different spiritual visions are required to be heard."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most direct is the king of the ghoul "Mordiquian", He is a true god, but this name is not his real name, but The translation of sound, because of the codename of the cold-spoken church's false inheritance, is only a convenient way for people to remember his code. The real name of the gods is unforgettable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened to his face and knew more about mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warren continues: "The teacher said that this book requires fifty points to hear, and that sixty-five points of vision are eligible to read. With seven foreign languages, it is the most powerful and horrible magic book known to date."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fifty o'clock to hear? My God, this is the end What kind of magic book is it?" Su Ge is full of shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of Su Ge’s contemplation, Jerouss waved at him and said, “Try to touch the soul.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded and walked in carefully to open his own vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the vision, Su Ge sees some pale green particles and purple particles throughout the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos said freely: "The green particles are the original The vitality of the purple particles is the original mystery. They are all contained in the blood, and the difference is too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded after listening, then went to contact The soul of the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the soul has completely disappeared from the human form, chaos, and almost became the original psionic power, which dissipated directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is going on here? The mysterious staff at the professional level is generally very tough, how can his soul become like this?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking in the heart, Su Ge exudes the scent of the priest gradually approaching the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the words of prayer in his mouth, this soul instinct gradually approaches Sog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's demeanor with kindness, embraces the soul with open arms and sees if he can ask something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My child, what happened?" The soft voice of kindness is transmitted through the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of this group squirmed and made a vague voice: "Sin, fire..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Just saying two words, I can't hear other sounds anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took a deep breath and gradually lowered his head and said, "Don’t worry, the goddess is with you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subjective consciousness has been completely blurred, and Su Ge is ready to connect his psionics with his psionic powers and try to understand his instinctive thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Su Ge was stopped by Gerlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" Gerlos asked Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge explained: "His subjective consciousness has been blurred. I want to connect through the psionics to see if there is any other relevant information about his instinct. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeros stretched out the soul directly after reaching out to the hand: "Do you want to use an apprentice's mental power to spy on a professional-level spirit?" Was it crushed by his psionics?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg heard this, the tester asked: "You mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bringing this soul away, Jerouss explained: "He is now losing his subjective consciousness, leaving only the most primitive chaos and animal nature. The psionic is full of violent. Now because Losing the form, the psionic power can't be released outwards. But if your consciousness comes in actively, facing you will be a spiritual blow to destroy the earth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;嘶嘶嘶~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Sugton made a chill, and there was a hint of fear in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dangers of this are far beyond his imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, all links are relative. Just like the aphorism of the Wolf Blood Legion in the Abyss, you are staring at the abyss. You. Unless your spirit and psionics are completely crushed, the link to rashly, even if the strength of the two sides is equal, will be infected by the opposite thoughts and madness."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugarton nodded like a chicken and glutinous rice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the education of Su Ge, Gerlos asked: "What did you find?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge said truthfully: "The consciousness is completely blurred, and the reason is not. Just two words are vaguely said, one is sin and the other is fire. There seems to be other words before and after these two words, but they are completely inaudible. Clear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two people talked, Warren suddenly found a very thin but delicate metal nameplate in the crack in the corner floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
