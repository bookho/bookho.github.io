			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the palace, Su Ge looked nodded by a group of doctors to advance the operating room Connor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maria on the side said with a trace of admiration: "The Bishop Sotos please rest assured that this is the royal doctor, the top for the medical care of His Majesty. The team must be able to save the assassin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the briefing of Su Ge, a few hours, this Suger Sotos Not only did the investigation of the plague and the end of the plague clear, but even found an assassin who mastered the key intelligence, such efficiency has made Maria suddenly look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My followers?" Su Ge turned and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When entering the palace, due to the lack of Su Ge's face, Hills and Vegginia were detained outside for the most rigorous inspection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary smiled and said: "You can rest assured that we are only routine, will not be embarrassed by your entourage, they are here, please!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the leadership of Maria, Su Ge came to the hall on the first floor of the castle, and when he saw the two of them, his face suddenly fell cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Maria, are you sure this is not a problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a group The soldiers were on full alert, and a dozen guns were against Hills and Virginia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men were armed back to back at this time, and Hills even entered the Dragon Man state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" Maria saw this rushing down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below, the leader Su Ge knows that it is a young officer similar to Jimmy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This officer sank at this time, waiting for Maria to speak, turned his head and said: "Maria! How do you do this housekeeping! This ! kinds of heavily armed knights there that people do not ghosts not ghosts monster is how come "; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; <br <br /> & nbsp />" who is the monster you say, "Sears listen! At the end of the day, the mouth was full of fangs, and the scarlet cock was staring at the officer like a dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Legion suddenly felt the danger, and the body instantly retreated to hide behind his team members. He shouted: "Shooting! Kill these two threats!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop They are the followers of Bishop Sotos!" Maria was anxious and immediately stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer turned to look at Su Ge behind her, sullenly said: "It is because of this spoiled follower to shoot! This spy blood church is spoiled!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out, he has great hostility towards Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inferior human beings, you are looking for death!" Sears spit out a chill in his mouth and tightened his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his hand slightly, stopped her movements, strolled to the officer and said coldly: "I forgive your ignorance, after all, the ignorant is fearless. Now swear at me Not angry, let your soldiers put down their weapons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer snorted and pulled out the pistol, and reached the forehead of Su Ge, his eyes widened and whispered: "External spies! Are you threatening the generals of the kingdom??"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, two members wearing suits passed by and stopped after seeing the scene. Step down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary hurriedly said: "Mr. Forlin, Mr. Arthur will quickly stop the behavior of General Gis."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slightly taller member of the Fulin faintly said: "As a foreigner who is a public threat to our generals, its nature has been characterized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Kill it, so that you can sneak it down later." The bald Arthur faint said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maria heard that it was completely stupid, then turned and ran, wanted to report to the majesty who was in the meeting, but was stopped by the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maria, you seem to be too sheltered for them, what benefits do they give you?" Gies yin and yang asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't want to smother your blood!" The gentle Maria was suddenly angry and angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with this situation, Su Ge is still calm, but has been calm, cold and indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two eyelids sagged slightly, and the deep blue eyes did not see any feelings in the black pupil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last warning." When Sug spoke, Gis apparently felt a chill on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frighten me? I know that you used a lot of rhetoric to deceive the Queen, but today you don't want to deceive me, I will collapse you now!" Said to trigger the class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, the Honourable Flint and Arthur’s mouth tilted slightly and seemed to be very willing to see the scenery when Su Ge’s head blossomed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General General Gies has a big mouth and a smirk on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the next second, his sneer froze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under his gaze, he suddenly found that his pistol seemed to be cut by the invisible sharp edge and broke from the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cross section of the metal is so neat, even the bullets inside are cut, and the dark gunpowder is scattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kill him! Kill this magician!" Gies quickly stepped back and prepared to hide behind the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shrill sound broke through, and Sug’s palm gripped his neck, slamming his arm like a sling Pick it up like a chicken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your mouth is too noisy, dregs." Su Ge at this moment is like a demon-hunter with no feelings, and the voice is like a scum The cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hit! Kill him!" Seeing this, the two members suddenly became shocked. First, they ran to the stairs leading to the second floor, pulling away the distance. Then the mouth yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the moment when these soldiers raised their weapons and turned to the standard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how many invisible blades have drifted away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next second, all the soldiers stared at each other and watched their hands break into two pieces of firearms. Their mouths were wide and they couldn't speak with horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene is quite different. They didn't even hear any sound, didn't hear any spells, didn't see anything, as if the weapons had broken off when they came out of the factory, they didn't find the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary's eyes wide open, she did not expect that elegant and easy-going, smiling and kindly bishop actually had such a terrible power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including Maria, two members, General Gis, all the soldiers, all the spirits rose a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warrior of Vigilia saw this scene, and he was shocked: "The way the sound blade is launched has completely changed, and the power is better than Increase a lot at a time, damn, what knowledge is this, too horrible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...this..." The two members are pale Relying on the armrests of the stairs, panic in the eyes, very panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Assassin! Assassin! The assassin of the Duke of the Mountains attacked the palace!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next second, Two people who are afraid of death are irresponsible to send out pig-like amnesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two old guys!" Hill's face was gloomy, and the body rushed out instantly, and a few breaths rushed out for twenty meters. Go directly to the two members of the parliament, then one by one, pinching the necks of two people, and said: "Give me shut up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃Uh..." Suddenly, the two legislators were stunned and their faces were red and their faces were terrified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg didn’t care at all, he looked up slightly and looked at the red-faced General Gies, who said faintly: "Look at my face, I Give you a life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, after a short arm, he took him out a meter away and was still on the ground like throwing garbage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
