			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aceline couldn’t help but smile when he saw Su Ge’s bitter face, and then tempted to say: Loss has a lot of information about the witch. If you handle this matter well, you can not only make your future flat, but also get the information that is very precious for you. Believe me, those intelligence can make you more Good to help these witches."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Adeline’s words, Su Ge replied: “It’s really tempting, but I’m going to measure it. How many means do you have in your own hands? Otherwise, Lu Hao promised to die only."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you want to think well! All the world's understanding of the truth of the witch, Gerlos It should be the top group." Adeline doesn't seem to worry about whether Su Ge can do it, just to seduce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of Su Ge’s heart suddenly seems to be caught by the kitten, itching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone will be tempted by things they don’t know. Especially when the unknown is closely related to yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth of the witch. He has been eager for a long time. Today, it is certain that there will be a truth in Gerlos. This condition directly holds Su Ge firmly and cannot break free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline clearly saw from the eyes of Su Ge that this road is not deep inside the little guy’s inner desire, asked: "So little guy, now How do you plan to change the situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning from fantasy, Su Ge thought for a moment, thoughts have been thought of in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Excuse me, Ms. Adeline, your mysterious ability should be related to illusion or dreams?" Su Ge looked at Adeline and asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelin suddenly got an accident and asked with a hint of curiosity: "How do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Scent, the smell of night scent and the scent of wine. The scent is easy to feel comfortable and relaxed. The smell of night scent is more of a hint. Because most of this scent exists at night, let After people smell it, people give people a hint of sleep to sleep at night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Suge turned his head and looked at Hills and Bernice, still in fantasy, and pointed to his head: "We are not three people who often fall into illusions, but today it seems very abnormal. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline hit a finger and looked at Su Ge with a smile: "Your analytical ability, ability to grasp details and logic They are all very good, Mr. Sotos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Adeline is not calling Su Ge as a little guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said in his heart: "This is the benefit of being in contact with the gods in learning in a dream."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline continues: "Your calculations are not wrong. The basis for the introduction of the female warlock is elemental prayer. In this way, the elements are mastered and into mystery. However, this is only the basis, we are The elements are not used to attack and destroy, but partners and tools. After mastering enough, we use elements as a medium to touch more invisible mysteries. Each element links countless mysteries. Soft water is very suitable for connection. Illusions and dreams."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Adeline’s affirmation, Su Ge’s heart was more confident, and he slammed his hand and asked: “You just said that you can be in your own name. Help me in the dark, right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aideline nodded slightly and looked at Su Ge’s heart and said: “Can this little guy really think of a solution?” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before in conversation with Gerlos, Gerlos had a chance for Su Ge Some fans believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Adeline very surprised, and this time the event is on the surface to let Su Ge deal with, in fact, in the dark two people are ready to deal with through the bishop Ron this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, Ron is even better than Gerlos in the ossification of occultism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, Adeline looks at Su Ge’s calm smile, and her heart is full of curiosity and surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug Sotos, let me take a good look at your performance!" Adeline thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s temptation asked: “Can you help me pull those people into a dream?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline listened to the brow and said : "Put these people into a dream? This is not difficult, that is, to pull people into a dream, you must first have direct or indirect contact with that person. It is more difficult now to bring these people together."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge was immersed in contemplation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline looked at the official Sug and asked: "If I help you bring them all into your dreams, what are you going to do?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug raised his head and said with a confident smile at his mouth: "I will talk to them and calmly let them leave here, don't happen here. Fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"??" Hearing this childlike naive tone, Adeline looked at her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Adelin confirmed, "Are you sure you are not kidding, is it true?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and said: "Of course, I am serious. In the current situation, this is the only way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think they will listen to you?" Adeline asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug shook his head and said, "They certainly won't listen to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" But! Su Ge said that this turn, the face with pride and solemnity: "They should give me a face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this Adelin suddenly jumped in her heart, and suddenly thought of a possibility in her heart, staring at Su Ge Shen Sheng: "What do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you just It is said that the god is multi-faceted, and my lord is not only the master of storm and death, but also the master of dreams. I am going to fall in the dream and summon my Lord to come in a short moment in my dream."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! thump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this, Adeline clearly felt that her unsteady heart began to accelerate uncontrollably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
