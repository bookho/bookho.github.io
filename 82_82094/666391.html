			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living room is still the living room, but at this time it gives an indescribable suppression and dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the shaman middle-aged man lay there, the horror frost emanating from the spear's body has frozen his body into a crystal Ice sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the gaze of everyone, the ice sculpture that was frozen to the limit showed a lot of cracks in itself, and finally turned into a place in the subtle bursting sound. ice crystals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing such a scene, the black-spotted warlock, and the moustache man's face are extremely dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who! Get out!" The black-spotted warlock screams loudly and violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warlock next to her reminded: "You have to be careful, the owners of these spears should be very powerful."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-spotted warlock seems to be very confident in his knowledge, and his face is gloomy: "Waste! This is a dream space. Since we can't control it, no one else can control it. It will only hide in the shadows." The coward who puts the cold arrow, what are you afraid of!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, the black-spotted warlock’s hands suddenly lifted up, muttering a few words in the mouth and a few huge shadows Appeared around her body, claws and claws, like a monster turned into darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, suddenly let other cultists regain confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moustache man spit out a chill, and turned into a ghostly cold wind rushing toward Kas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All these people have been killed!" The black-spotted warlock said at this moment, with a group of cults rushing toward Kas and others. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Cass has placed behind Ieta and Duke, and his posture is still calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta and other female warlocks were pale at this time, and the voice trembled and asked: "The deputy bishop, have we not had any other means?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kas looked at the front and faintly asked: "Are you skeptical about the power of my Lord?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard this, Iyeta hurriedly shook his head, then lowered The voice said: "The servant is dull and does not dare to doubt, but feels fear inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass heard a peaceful smile and said: "Good, my Lord appreciates honesty. And those who have self-knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Kas turned to look at six people, with a sincere and fanatical saying on his face: "Follow me to witness My Lord’s boundless power!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sound of Kas, there was a gust of cold wind in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cold wind is like coming from the coldest part of the world, with the horror of the frozen soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this cold wind, a group of cultists instantly supported the psionic shield and released their knowledge and psionics to attack several people. Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, dozens of weird spells have been applied to the body of Kas and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the psychological shadow, Ieta and others saw this scene close their eyes and hoped that the pain would end earlier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the release of various spells, the black-spotted warlock who thought it would kill him, found that all his attacks were completely blocked by the cold wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that their spells are a very common smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a strong wind that completely blows them away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The situation is a bit wrong." At this time, the captain of the church, the moustache man whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the cold wind?" asked the black spot warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rise of the cold-blooded church since the northerly continent has been based on the knowledge of the cold series. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moustache man was dignified and whispered: "This cold wind has a very high mystery, and I don't understand the knowledge contained in it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Waste "The black-spotted warlock is violent." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain who came to the master level immediately couldn’t see the doorway of this cold wind, which made the black spot warlock very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when two people were still calculating how to attack, they suddenly heard a few plops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-spotted warlock turned his head and saw that his body was squatting on the ground at this time, his face was pale, his eyes were dull looking at the sky. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to see what incredible existence, what indescribable fear, horror and terror destroy their courage, the horrible unknown drowns their reason . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-spotted warlock snorted and turned to look at the sky............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The face that was scared behind Kas was pale, like an ostrich with his eyes closed, and several female warlocks curled up into a ball did not wait until those horrible spells came to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a voice full of excitement and excitement came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at it! Look at the sky!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking is Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four men opened their eyes and saw Duke’s eyes wide and his look filled with excitement and admiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In curiosity, four people, such as Yieta, followed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, they knew their ridiculousness, they knew their ignorance, they knew their childishness, they knew the narrowness of their cognition, and they knew The limits of your own poor thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when the ceiling of the living room has disappeared, replaced by a gray-white cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clouds slowly rolled, and the faint ones could see countless shadows in them, but they could not see what it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As time went by, the clouds rolled down and the speed of those shuttles slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment they clearly see that there are countless souls wandering in the clouds, hehe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These souls are free-spirited and serene, like children who play in the paradise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the cloud is like the symbol of the soul, the heaven of redemption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these souls naturally cannot scare them like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While these souls are wandering, there is a huge shadow in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows cover the sky, like a giant that can completely cover the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows are gradually approaching, and the horrible oppression makes these people unable to breathe, and the chest seems to be being weighed with weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time doesn’t know how long it’s been, at this moment everyone’s eyes are wide open and they hold their breath, just like seeing the most incredible thing in the world. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fog, an incomparably huge battleship gradually emerged from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warship is at least a few hundred meters long, and it looks like an ancient wooden oceanic warship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the whole body is crystal clear ice blue, cast from unknown materials, looks crystal clear and seamless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The towering mast alone has no sails and gazebos, but it gives a spectacular and arrogant singularity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hull is surrounded by hailstones and ships that surround countless souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
