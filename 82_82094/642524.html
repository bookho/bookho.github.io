			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Sherry’s pinch-in-the-dice game, Su Ge didn’t ask much about it, and his focus was on the party tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling before it is not casual, the guidance of the Holy Grail is not a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Sog needs to be fully prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic potion needless to say, is his core killer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cane is also naturally carried, this is his core weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the mysterious material, Sug is ready to bring some silver ash, which sometimes has a miraculous effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing about the uniform of the church in the evening clock, Su Ge is considering whether to wear it, after all, it is likely to involve some places that need to show identity. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now the church has completely confirmed my existence, with their determination, it will definitely take a lot of effort, especially the Laurie, I guess there is Very deep hatred. They are very likely to wait for me to appear for the second time, and then suddenly I will catch me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is very sure now The blood church will not kill yourself because there is too much knowledge in their heads that they desire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time they also need to master the entire night church through Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now Su Ge is pinched on the door of the Church of the Holy Blood, and there is no fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left pick right, Su Ge decided to wear a normal western costume bundle, but the jacket is made up of black robes, and can be carried with su The grid flew away directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After re-shaping the cane and turning it into a wooden cane, Su Ge looked at himself in the mirror and nodded with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is to wait quietly and adjust your spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 7:30 in the evening, after eating a sumptuous dinner at home, Su Ge went out of the house with a sip of food. With the street lights, he could see that Duke sitting in the carriage was waving at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After stepping onto the carriage, Duke accidentally asked: "Don't Ms. Black Sheep come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge smiled: "There are some small bugs in the house, she is going to remove the insects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke looks strange, he can't imagine that beautiful The glamorous beauty actually does the nausea and low-level work of removing insects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of person is Mrs. Merris?" Sitting in the carriage, Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke touched his chin: "It is a very attractive woman, mature, intellectual, although she is over fifty years old, but still very beautiful. It is very business-oriented and very conservative. Under the ethos of the Imperial Capital, there have never been any bad rumors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a son?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a son, two daughters. The son is now in the military at the Royal Military Academy. The two daughters are graduating soon and have not been engaged."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge nodded, and secretly concealed the details of the Duchess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can clearly feel that the Duchess is not ordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage went down the street towards the city center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, the carriage stopped in front of a large manor near the Tokachi Gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire manor is surrounded by tall walls, standing outside and not seeing any inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no carriage left outside the door. Everyone will leave the carriage after they have come down, and then pick up on time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men just got off the carriage and Su Ge heard an unexpected sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? Mr. Assassin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this voice, Su Ge’s heart said: "The instincts of Laozi are really accurate. This guy is coming, there is no good thing. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I turned around, I just saw the bard of the bard, and took off some of the worn clothes, replaced them with new suits, and my hair was neat. The beard is clean and looks handsome and handsome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said, "Come with friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Didn't the lady come?" Guyu hurriedly changed his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He almost called out the word of the sage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug shakes his head: "Today, at home, I haven’t come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing Duke on the side asked some unexpected questions: "Master Gu, do you know Mr. Assassin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gujue laughed: "Of course, we are good friends. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Duke laughs and says: "It’s really a good thing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "How do you know each other?" Su Ge was a little curious on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke’s explanation: “It’s in an antique market, and the ancient master’s appreciation of antiques is top-notch.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, several people handed the invitation over and walked into the gate under the guidance of the guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you get this invitation?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke blinked his eyes: "Do you know the influence of the ancient masters?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Hey?" Su Ge is a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this kid not just a few days old? Can you have an impact? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel like laughing and laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time three people have entered the yard, and the party that can see the open air has already begun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawn of the shallots has tables and shelves with delicious food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About hundreds of young men and women laughing and laughing, these people are dressed in formal dresses, the makeup is neat and delicate, and it is not ordinary people at first glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just coming in, when Su Ge hasn’t returned to God, the three noble ladies who passed by are suddenly shocked when they saw the ancient feelings: “Ancient Master Master!? Wow! It’s really a master of ancient sensation!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice immediately attracted other aristocratic ladies around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, the ancient feelings were surrounded by a group of beautiful aristocratic ladies, and they were asked non-stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes widened on this scene and murmured, “What the hell is this?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Duke smiled and explained: "The ancient master has a lot of skills and has seen a lot of things. He not only has a legendary experience, but also is very good at singing and writing poetry. The most important thing is that the ancient master has a kind of "#br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the unique?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Divination."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Divination? How is a divination?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke sighed: "The ancient master's divination is amazing, he doesn't have to Any auxiliary tool can accurately guess a lot of things by looking at the person's appearance and palm. He calls it the face-to-face and the palmistry, and they are collectively referred to as: fortune telling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"............"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke continues: "You know, these little girls who are imagining every day are obsessed with this, and ancient I think the master still counts this Accurate, suddenly became the idol of many people "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
