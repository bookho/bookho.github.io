			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps: for the lord of the emptiness of the gods plus <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is getting closer, and the woman is trying to hold it Breathe, don't let him notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her injury seems to be very serious, and at this critical time, she couldn’t help but cough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough and cough......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harsh cough suddenly sounded, and the scared man slammed back Two steps, followed by blowing out the whistle at the waist and blowing it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" The woman whispered, flashing a burst of flames in her eyes, raising her hand and slamming at the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hula! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man burned a hot flame around him, but did not hurt the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The damn psionic shield!" Seeing this, the woman whispered a little violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the woman slammed Suge’s collar and whispered: “You damn guy! Why come over!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he will push Su Ge away: "Come on! Don't delay the aging mother... cough..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The harsh whistle resounded through the night, and the three people who had just dispersed all gathered in ten seconds to block the alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people stretched out their bodies and took out their arms and slowly approached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The burning witch, I advise you to surrender, we can spare you a life, otherwise we will kill you directly here." The man with the fork whispered threatening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the woman finished listening, she said: "If the old lady is out of control, she will not fall into the hands of your polar research institute."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, his hands flashed red and orange red again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough and cough...噗嗤! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light just illuminates, and the woman coughs up sharply, then squirts a large mouthful of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You haven’t had a good lung injury. If you continue to use it, you will soon suffocate and die." The four men said but did not rush forward. Instead, I was careful to get closer, seemingly very jealous for women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman was very weak after the cough, her face was sallow, her lips were pale, and her chest was violently undulating like a bellows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a distance of about five meters, four people took out a quirky pistol from their arms and shot at the woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the accuracy of the four people is limited. Only four rounds of bullets hit the woman’s body, and the rest are not shot on the ground, or shot on the trash can. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sitting on the floor looked down and found that it was not a bullet, but an anesthetic needle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no precision in this kind of needle, no wonder the hit rate is so touching." Su Ge pinched a needle to play, and the heart was secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the woman was shot in the first round. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" The woman pulled out the needle that had pierced her arm and felt a violent dizziness without waiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two legs trembled, they sat weakly on the ground and couldn’t stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, the four people breathed a sigh of relief and came out with a black rope from their arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Captain, there is an ordinary person here, what should I do?" The tall man pointed to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain holding the fork snorted: "Directly kill, feed the werewolf, we have no energy to deal with this garbage."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman on the ground heard this tough turn and said, "I’m stupid, why don’t you go!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge Smiled and looked at her and replied: "Because it is a fool, I don't want to leave, but I always have stupid people, maybe this is not a bad thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Said, Su Ge slowly stood up and looked at the people on both sides calmly said: "People of the Institute of Polar Studies, I think I can give me a face today, let me leave this lady?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha!?" Hearing this, the four people looked awkward and some did not return to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the four people suddenly gave a shrill laugh, as if they heard the world's best laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and asked: "How? Look at your smile so happy, is it agreed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Looking for death!" The youth holding the fork suddenly stopped, and suddenly stepped forward, the sharp fork directly stabbed to Su Ge's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge was prepared, his body swiftly flashed to the side, grabbed his wrist with his right hand, and then twisted his left wrist, gently on the chest of the youth. I swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not a hunter, this kind of fork is not valid for me." Su Ge whispered, opening his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Su Ge’s body is sideways, the young man takes a step forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain!?" The other three people haven't seen anything abnormal because of the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the captain looked down hard and found that his heart did not know when he had been pierced by a sharp blade, and a lot of warm blood continued to go along his chest and clothes. Flow down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compass! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man’s body is weak on the ground, and after a few twitches, he will not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other three people in the night realized that things were wrong, and suddenly pulled out their weapons, and they said, "Look for death!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, three sharp weapons greeted Su Ge at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger This long-term high-intensity combat combat training is not comparable to these three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only seeing Su Ge at this time is like the martial arts master on TV, the body is moving in a precise and easy way to escape the attack of three people, the cane in the hand, Draw directly on the neck of the young man on the left and directly stun him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the body stepped back and escaped the cut blade. The shoulder suddenly slammed up and smashed the knife. The cane swung in a beautiful arc in the hands of Su Ge. After that, he stabbed backwards from the squat of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment of piercing, the cane has become a sharp edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood splatters under the moon, spattered on the wall, on the trash can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall young man spit blood, incredulously looking at the cane that suddenly became a sword: "This... does not meet... machinery... construction..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children, there is no science in mythology." Su Ge sighed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stick is the illusion of the meteor gun Gunganer, which is known to be a metamorphosis. The little trick of deformation is just the foundation of the foundation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than ten seconds, just four people are now left with one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman sitting on the floor saw this scene feeling that she was dreaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is I really dreaming?" The woman knew that her will was a little fuzzy, so she reached out and licked her thigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sting is transmitted through the nerves, and the woman is determined that she is not dreaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This guy is actually an assassin!" She just saw the sleeve sword in Su Ge's sleeve, which is the usual equipment of the Assassin League Assassin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the last person left and then retire, and both hands are together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
