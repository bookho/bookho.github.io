			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bain University's independent apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Evan is pleased to give it to you." Su Ge looked at Niya seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niya nodded: "You can rest assured that even if you are not a friend of the teacher, I will take care of it. He is really talented."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One thing, I need to talk to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You please say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Work hard and make a huge difference in the world in the future. At that time, I hope that you can lead people out of the gas and meet the electricity." Su Ge looked at her. Seriously said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niya accidentally looked at Su Ge and looked at this young man who was a teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time his eyes are so deep and bright. It is as black as a black hole, but she feels light and transparent, like a black glass, like an ink star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The eyes are so beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good...well," she instinct The answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "If you have any difficulties, ask your teacher, she can give you the answer, believe me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Su Ge turned and left very quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cathedral of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just after returning, Su Ge got the news, Emilia’s order was cancelled, and Anthony could not leave Bain, or even directly assigned to the countryside. Local work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order was very urgent, and the execution was very rushed and compulsory. Even if Su Ge and those people did not meet, they were taken away, including even Han. Ke and Ivan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg heard a very calm return to the cathedral, once again met the bishop of Nell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Bishop of Nell is completely different from the past, calm and indifferent, and at the same time giving people a temperament that does not eat human fireworks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This temperament is very similar to Emilia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at him calmly, and he looked at Su Ge calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting closer, but ultimately did not speak, quietly missed, as if not knowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the bedroom, Su Ge looked at the Grail document rags and said: "This thing has been a little wasteful, hey! Can you turn into a shawl? Or something like a cloak?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Sug patted it hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday's battle, Su Ge found that he had one of the most vital parts on his line, that is, a shawl, or a cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he found that there was no such thing, the blood that splashed was easily spattered on his beautiful black suit, and his hands were stained with blood, There must always be something to wipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time you need a shawl, or a cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course he is not the first person to think of this idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the demon hunters have a black leather shawl on their shoulders in addition to that hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this shawl, while maintaining warmth, is another role that is used to rub the blood and minced meat on the weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not Suge, but is introduced in the book. When the set of clothes was designed, it was already qualitative for the cloak that looked very handsome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rag that was squeezed in the hands of Su Ge felt the will of Su Ge at this time, and with the rapid squirming, the volume of the entire rag seems to be changing. small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, turned into a dark cloak about one meter long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it climbed behind Su Ge's body and folded to form a tall stand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collar of the collar is extended by two cute little claws that are attached to the shoulders of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the right thing, and finally shows the value of your document as a holy grail!" Su Ge saw this face satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightly stand up and find that the size of the cloak is very fit, and then put it on your calf, not long or short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-necked and black suits that stand up on the shoulders are a perfect match. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I finally know why the handsome cloaks in the movie can be firmly fixed without the buckle, and I want to pick it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because, the way those guys wear cloaks is really a spell!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge looked at himself in the mirror and was more and more satisfied with the cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not move this way in the future, if you can follow me, you don't have to give Lobo a dog pad," Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the cloak trembled and seemed to be very happy in the chicken-like nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After picking it off, this time it’s not a ball in the rough city, but a regular hanging on the hanger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the rag very touched and excited and trembles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When dinner, Griffin came over and whispered: "Bishop, Nell, the bastard said that you don't give any guards when you go back."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge casually said: "There is no difference when you come, this little thing is not worthy of anger, calm some."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Griffin silenced and asked: "What if you happen, what are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge glanced at him with a slight eyebrow and smiled: "What should I do if I come here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gryffin looked at Su Ge's relaxed and confident look, The inside is suddenly looser. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a subordinate concern, and it’s time to confirm the preparation before departure.” Griffin finished, respectfully retired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Su Ge still does not intend to see the book of frenzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way back to Guinness is just boring, it’s a good time to see that it’s better to enjoy it now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When taking a bath, Su Ge felt it, then closed his eyes and went to the Kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope, Green Glass wants to see you. If you can, you can condescend to dream and he confirms some things. The believer is incompetent, he I don't believe in the words of believers. Here I capture the spiritual energy fluctuations belonging to the Marquis, and I hope to be useful to His Majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the answer from Bernice, Su Ge nodded slightly Respond: "You are doing very well, take a good rest, and then hand it over to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Condescend to dream..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suggs, walking out of the temple, looking at the gray sky around, free to analyze the special psionic fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, he faintly felt a glimpse of the connection in the endless gray bubble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before I was too weak, now the psionics have skyrocketed, and the vision has reached forty. The heart and strength have been leaps and bounds, so I should try it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he first concealed his own body, only retaining some power about dreams, and striding with the glimpse of the connection. Into the twisted dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grey world is very dangerous, here is the world of all human subconscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a twisted world, twisted to the point where you can see all sorts of monsters, scenes, and even time and space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fragile world, fragile until you just enter, and the world is completely shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a dangerous world. Although everything in the dream is illusory, it is true to the outsiders who enter this dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step in the process, Su Ge felt that his spirit has experienced hundreds of thousands of worlds, witnessed countless twisted scenes, and awkward monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last second stood in the bar, and the next second was chased by countless devils...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If ordinary people witness this situation, they will be completely mad at that moment, and even be directly scared to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is a master mystery, the spirit may be broken by the fragile dream, or eaten by those monsters fabricated out of thin air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Su Ge is different, he is the master of dreams, he is the god here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All illusions, all dreams are nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green has often had a dream for many years, in which he and his wife, with a pair of daughters walking in a beautiful park, suddenly a happy family suddenly In a world of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wife and daughters were all overwhelmed by the bloody world, and he could only stand there alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happiness and sweetness turned into pain and loneliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the punishment of the eldest daughter!" This dream has been done too many times, and he has seen it many times in this scene. He knows that this is a dream, knowing that it is illusory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, every time he saw this, he felt his chest to be torn apart, and the pain and self-blame made him breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have seen hundreds of thousands, still, his generation can not get used to, can not let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should you wake up soon?" The dream is very familiar. Every time he feels he wants to suffocate, he knows he is about to wake up in his dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the dream that has not changed over the years has suddenly changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When pain is unacceptable, it is also a sharpening stone that will hone people's will. Heaven will fall to the ranks of the people, and must first suffer from it. That's the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very calm, plain voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who!?" Green suddenly became nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the eldest daughter died, he also missed many dreams, but he never heard such a true and clear voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bloody sea, Su Ge's demeanor floated freely, with a smile on his lips, behind his hands, and his dark eyes looked at Green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Green was alert and his heart was low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystery does have a lot of careers and knowledge that can invade other people's dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is very clear that only masters and above can invade other people’s dreams from a distance, and it is costly and dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly said: "Bennis has already told you? I will come to you this evening."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...is Suger Sotos!?" Hearing this, Greenton widened his eyes and looked incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly and reached out and said: "The Holy Blood Church of the Guinness Regional Bishop, Suger Sotos has seen the Marquis of Grasse."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green looked at Su Ge for a long time and said: "You...not in Bain City?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I am still in Bain City," Sukri said of course. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
