			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard Su Ge’s words, the fat middle-aged man was cautious: “It seems that you have been cheated, John, this guy is not an ordinary person who is ignorant. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John shook his head and said firmly: "Suge is definitely an ordinary person. I looked at you the last time. I am definitely not this guy." Suger Sotos!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at the two with a dangerous smile, suddenly pale and frightened, and trembling, The tone stuttered: "Teacher... I... I don't know anything... Don't... don't kill me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Su Ge is like changing face I changed back to the smile just like this: "Is the last look like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two saw Su Ge’s so flexible and realistic acting Suddenly shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you!! Why do you pretend to be my dead student!?" John knows that he met the same person twice, but he does not I believe this guy is a student who died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge shakes his cane: "There is no impersonation, I am the real Suog Sotos. Otherwise you think that you are in Bain City. So strict, there is no large-scale action, how did the police suddenly discover you, and annihilate you so quickly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this John's eyes gradually widened, raising his finger and pointing at Su Ge's angry whisper: "It's you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge spread his hands and said: "Yes, it is me. I didn't die that night. After I fled home early, I planned to go to the police station to sell the case for my disappearance. I didn't intend to report it. But I actually met your partner who was throwing a corpse. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, Su Ge is very cheerful, and his expression is full of wonderful memories: "Haha, he wanted to kill me. And I was like Now, let him go all the way, then lead him to this similar alley. Just in his self-righteous When prepared to kill me, you know what I encountered "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;? & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; John choked back anger staring Scotland did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha ha ha ha!" Su Ge couldn't help but laugh and continued: "I met two demon hunters. They both easily killed Jess. I took all the things I saw in the sect. People, everything is said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, John’s face was distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several months they have always thought that the sect had problems with the undercover on the police side and sold the organization. After that, they conducted a rigorous internal review and killed a lot of suspicious believers and cadres, which made the organization that was already badly hurt even worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what he never imagined was that the initiator was actually the unremarkable dead body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, John’s face turned from red to purple, his chest was constantly inflated like a bellows, and his veins were violent, coming to the edge of the runaway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Su Ge smiled more smoothly: "Thanks to you, I not only awakened my talent, I also successfully joined the Church of the Holy Blood, now I Has become a trainee bishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouth is extremely ironic smile: "Teacher! Thanks to you, let me embark on this life." On the road of subversion, I will repay you with my sincere sincerity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I killed you!" John screamed in anger, suddenly Take out the pistol in his arms and shoot at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he took out the pistol, Suger’s body was ready to rush forward, blocking his gun with the palm of his black leather glove. Mouth, hold the gun body firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for death!" John looked awkward and hooked the trigger directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! A muffled sound, the tail of the firearm gave off a pungent smell of gunpowder, and the part of the gun was somewhat shaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Su Ge should have bloody palms but no injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible!" Seeing this scene, John and the fat middle-aged people were shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is a master mystery, it is impossible to not use mystery, just use the flesh to block bullets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug grabbed the gun and grabbed it and was still on the ground, licking the right hand of some of the hemp, the left hand’s cane flashed, and instantly changed Become a sharp sword and hold the right hand of the heart to the middle-aged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man is many times stronger than John’s half-way half-bringing. After feeling the cold of the long sword, his body suddenly slams back. At the same time, the heart in the hand is thrown directly to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Su Ge clearly felt that the heart began to accelerate, and the metal rods embedded in the atrium gradually fell off the muscles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't die together!" John was now irritated by anger and hatred, and his body rushed forward, hugged Su Ge's body, and his body went down. The legs are on the legs of Su Ge, like a child hanging on an adult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, my life is much more expensive than yours." Su Ge responded faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the right hand touched the back waist at a very fast speed, and the skull of the ice was taken out by Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the heart has begun to swell, and Sog’s vision can even see that some tiny corrupt particles have spilled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the crucial moment, with the injection of psionic power, the skull that was squeezed by Su Ge suddenly ignited the ice blue fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of wildfire does not have any temperature, but is extremely cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fire was burning, the explosive bomb that was about to explode was frozen into ice sculpture from the inside out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a second, fell to the ground and broke the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no outbreak of corpse poison, no flying parasites, and some are just crystal clear ice crystal fragments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
