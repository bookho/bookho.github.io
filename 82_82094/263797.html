			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking on the streets of Yumucheng, Su Ge saw the streets full of traces of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, the walls of the house are full of bullet marks and bullet holes. Some houses have been blown down by half, and the middle or the edge of the street There are collapses and craters after the explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the face-to-face bloody sunset, it gives people a sense of desolateness and sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it’s an illusion. Looking at these scenes, Suger’s nose gradually smelled a pungent smell of gunpowder. After entering, Su Ge did not rush to leave, but followed the previous team to their cargo station. When they loaded and unloaded the goods, Su Ge used it a little. Some mysterious means smoothly took the backpack sandwiched in the middle of the barrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the sky has dimmed, and the city that has just calmed the smoke has been shrouded in the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug found a relatively mid-range hotel, renting a 20-square-meter for 20 nights, facing the riverside room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was clean, but slightly damp, which was very uncomfortable for Sugg, who was used to living in a dry environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the current situation, the territory of Vanas is estimated to have only one capital city, and the surrounding satellite cities have been captured by the Duke of the Mountain." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s mind was thinking about putting down some insignificant salutes, putting on combat equipment and leaving the room with a cane and key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he does not plan to stay here for too long, he still has to collect intelligence, no matter what the future, there is no harm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the night in the night is not lively, very quiet, and even dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the war, many buildings have been destroyed, and the lights on both sides of the street are also star-studded, intermittent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the people here have no nightlife at all, so it is shattered to go to the pub to inquire about the news." Su Ge muttered in the mouth of the silent road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the war and the raging of the werewolf, people are very afraid of the night, and the dark streets look like they can't see any people, just like a dead city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No one, but it doesn't mean there is no intelligence. Since it is not too flat at night, look at what can't be done." Think of the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger is now not afraid of the overall strength of the overall improvement, in the current situation, he is happy to determine the mystery of the city by encountering some mysterious duel The situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The young man at dusk said that he is a descendant of the dragon. The accent of the speech has some taste of the northerly continent, so the accident should be Longyan. Believers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are now known people of the Institute of Polar Studies and Death Denominations, there should be other mysterious organizations."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge adjusts his posture, hides his body in the shadows, then rings the spirit bell and makes a simple detection of the surrounding conditions. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤......噗嗤......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell just released, Su Ge heard a while Heavy gasping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body gradually tightened and Su Ge turned his head slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the corner of the corner, a tall shadow gradually approaches in the moonlight, and the heavy gasp is clearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge closed his eyes and felt the feedback of the bell. A tall human figure about two meters tall appeared in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly squeeze the cane in your hand to prepare for the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three seconds later, the owner of the shadow appeared in front of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was an orc with a height of two meters, a strong body and a gray hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a narrow face and mouth like a wolf, with sharp claws, thick legs and strong, almost exactly the same as the legendary werewolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the corner, the huge nose smelled in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, a pair of bloody red eyes full of turbidity locked in Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Where...” After seeing Su Ge, the werewolf’s breathing gradually became heavy, his eyes flashed violently, and his mouth was full of fangs. Opened, suddenly rushed toward Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s cane, eager to say: “Exactly, let me see what the legendary werewolf is.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the werewolf jumped up and threw himself at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, the whole body of the werewolf suddenly ignited a fierce flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This flame seems to appear out of thin air, covering his entire body in an instant. And the flame is very violent, it seems that there is no burning process, directly turning his hair, skin, body tissue into dark coke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is more cautious because the flame is a bit strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is still quiet, the werewolf has been burning for less than ten seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And today's werewolves exude black smoke, and the whole body is completely charred, just like a spark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Foreigners, no one warns you not to go out at night?" A weak voice rang in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge heard the sound, in the alley across the street, a woman wearing tight leather armor looked at herself against the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman looks like she is about 30 years old, her body is hot and sexy, and her close-fitting leather body highlights her mature body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the leather armor, wearing a gray robe covered her large body, it looked like a passing mercenary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge put on a frightened look and said: "Thank you very much, I just arrived here today, no one has told me about it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough and cough..." The woman coughed with a sip in her mouth and said weakly: "Take me back to where you live, wait until dawn. Come out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, turned and walked into the hutong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soig, who came out to find things, would not miss such a perfect opportunity, and hurried to keep up and said: "This lady, your situation does not seem very good! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't follow me. Also, my state I know." The woman pushed the wall and moved on, as if to go on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continued: "I know a little about medicine. If you don't mind, I can help you diagnose it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Suddenly, the woman suddenly turned back and grabbed Su Ge’s mouth, hugged him and hid behind the hutong trash can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This wolf is just dead, she is nearby, hurry up! This time I can't let the witch run!" Outside, four wearing grey robes The man looked around the werewolf and quickly dispersed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who stayed is gradually putting it into the alley here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back of the woman who was crushed by Su Ge at this time clearly felt the close-fitting leather breastplate, amazing softness and elasticity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The virgin’s heart was slightly swaying, and Suge quickly recovered his spirit and seized the focus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Witch! She is actually a witch!" Su Ge’s eyes turned slightly and looked at the woman who was attached to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman has a dark red hair and eyebrows, the eyes are very beautiful, the face is oval, the skin is rough and sallow because of some wind cream, but Does not affect her overall beauty, but because of the temperament of this old spicy wind cream, giving a mature hot sexy, like the same bottle of weather-beaten spirits, full of different flavors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
