			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps: for the lord of the emptiness of the gods <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the tentacle appears, two times, very The speed is rushing towards here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This momentum is very fierce, and not to mention the scary spikes and tooth-sucking suckers on the blue-gray touch, just by the huge tentacles This kind of speed bump will cause great trauma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope of this move is very large, it can be said that this narrow alley is covered, there is no possibility of dodging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's over!" Seeing this huge tentacle, the woman's face was pale and her face was desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is well aware of the horror of this tentacle. Her teammates and friends were completely torn apart under the attack of the tentacles. Only the bones and internal organs were left. The skin and muscles of the outer face were all shaved by the spikes and suction cups of the tentacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a very heavy, solemn and sacred bell rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sound of the bell?" The sound quality of this bell is very special. When I heard this bell, the woman actually felt that her faint will was a little more spiritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, a violent collision sounded in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman looked up and saw her unforgettable shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deadly horrible tentacle is about one meter away from the distance between the two people. It seems that it is blocked by the distance. It is like an invisible passport protecting two The same as individuals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible!" The opposite youth saw this screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man looks very bad at this time, half of his body has been covered by gray-black scales, and even the body on the side of the tentacle has begun to gradually collapse. Bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scales fall off and the blood splatters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s face was very dignified at this time, and he tried his best to maintain the night clock and resist the erosion of the tentacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five seconds...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young mouth opposite the mouth spewed a large cyan blood The tentacles that were blocked by the late bell and the outer moment collapsed instantly, turning into a large dark green liquid that slipped on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man was kneeling on the ground, and the entire right arm and the small half of the body had disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing it, he paid a very painful price in order to summon this tentacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What the hell are you?!" The young man was still alive, whispering his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge said faintly: "A passer-by who knows a little about mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" A little know one or two!? Hehe..." The young man listened with a laugh, not knowing whether he was happy or self-deprecating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then his body fell to the ground and died completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squatted down and asked, "Ms. Are you okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woman Slightly smiled, his eyes closed and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pick up the cane and stun the person who made the knife, Suog picked up the woman's body and quickly left here and returned to the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At ten o'clock in the evening, Su Ge put the woman on her bed, and the leather armor that slightly opened his chest would be a few times on her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The left lobes appear to be broken, causing the chest to inflate and oppress breathing, which is a sign of pneumothorax."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge thought of this, hurriedly took out a half-sized syringe from the backpack, and after simple disinfection, Su Ge untied her breastplate and picked up her top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, a pair of towering double peaks covered by bras appeared in front of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman’s body is very good, and it’s the result of years of exercise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chest is tall, the body is slender, and the flat belly can see the obvious mermaid line, which is very attractive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咕噜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sugg swallowed his mouth and felt his heart beat faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This face-to-face real beauty body, he still saw it for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now is not the time to think about these things!" Su Ge shook his head, added a meditation to himself, took a deep breath, and carefully explained Open her bra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After releasing the bra's pressure on the ribs, Sug reached out and gently touched her left rib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Shengxue Library, he has read a lot of medical books and human body structure, although it is not well known, but also very thorough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following her left side down and down, find the gap between the second rib and the third rib, Sug picks up a small awl Gently puncture a hole less than five millimeters in diameter in the rib gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then just step the needle into the hole to act as a channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like the sound of a balloon deflated, a lot of air leaking from the lungs is discharged from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the dispatch of the air, the bulging chest of the woman slowly subsided and the breathing was smoother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Su Ge took out a blood-red medicine from his backpack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a must-have cure for the outing, which is hand-picked by Hank’s father’s hand, which can greatly stimulate the self-healing ability of the cells. Heal damaged tissue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about it, Su Ge still injected this blood medicine into her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the truth in a critical moment, a series of actions by the woman just made Su Ge determine her essence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After everything was done, Su Ge took a deep breath and didn’t dare to go out to take a bath. After arranging the mysterious warning of the room, he leaned on the bed. Sleeping down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Elena wakes up from sleep, she feels very comfortable Not only did the breath recover smoothly, but even the sting of the lungs disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" She had some doubts in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening your eyes slowly, she first felt the warm sunlight coming in from the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then is the warm quilt that presses on your body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is this?" Elena slowly sat up, and as the quilt fell off she felt her chest cool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down, just seeing that I was naked, the bra didn’t know when it was untied, and then slipped down her Guanghua’s shoulder, a pair of tall and tall towering The double peaks are exposed to the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter!?" Elena hurriedly picked up the quilt and held her chest, watching it cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich experience is not a young girl, the eyes are full of calm and steady, and around the patrol, she saw the bloody needle on the table , needles, awl, and related disinfection things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing, she seems to want to understand, lifted her left arm and turned to look at it, under her ribs there was a tiny scar that had just healed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's actually blood therapy!" Elena was very surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This blood wound can be repaired together with the lungs overnight, which is the exclusive high-end goods of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
