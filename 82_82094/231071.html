			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Basilica of the Holy Blood, the Bishop's bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The vampires must be wiped out!" The pale-haired missionary sat in a chair, full of determination, and said that Ron’s bishop was attacked by a vampire. sympathy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting opposite him is Bishop Ron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Bishop Ron was very embarrassed, his eyes covered with gauze, and from the side, he felt a little distorted in his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Ron smiled, his pale lips sipped a cup of black tea and said: "The Church of the Holy Blood and the Glorious Church have always been friendly allies. We both The church has once marched into the abyss three times, and has also chased the storm dragon together and destroyed many cults. It can be said to be a strategic partner. Father Harold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Father Harold listened with a smile on his face: "Yes, we have a common force field, and we should help each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For you just proposed After I thought about it, I promised, but you should know that any acquisition is costly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Harold is full of excitement, hard Said: "You said, I will do my best to help you achieve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need to activate your replacement technique to heal my eyes." Bishop Bi has already thought about it, and immediately said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Harold stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You bring three people, and with your strength, even if you consume one, you can return to the Holy See smoothly. With this small price, you can smoothly switch to the need." The sale of the holy virgins that you have been looking for for a few months is very cost-effective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Harold’s face is more tangled and silent. Five minutes, I asked, "Who do you need?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The knife axe, the knight's light is somewhat distorted, the demon's blood is poisonous." Ron Premeditated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Harold bit his teeth: "Yes, but the process and ritual preparation will take a month. I hope that after you return to the light, don't talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The name of the holy virgin is Ada Newton, the nun of the monastery in the north of our city. You can look over this time, I am not lie to you." Bishop Ron said very sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Harold sighed and said: "Thank you for your help, the ceremony can begin tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good, you are tired of estimating the wind all the way, please go to rest, the room is ready." Bishop Ron stood up and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Harold is in a salute and leaves with a heavy heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he left, a clergyman hurried in, it was the Gaelic priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came in and posted a few words on the side of Bishop Ron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron immediately gloomy after listening to his face: "Waste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's next? Do? Bishop adults." Gaelic officer asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron meditates: "Ada Newton has not left yet, we can't rush to move Sog Sotos. Call him back to learn In the name of him, he was not allowed to go out under house arrest. After a month, Ada Newton was taken away by the Glorious Church. After my eyes recovered, I will take an hour to study what he is before the ceremony begins. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for the police, let her disappear!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand!" Gael The priest left quickly after listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn around and sit down and take out the black book with a hint of fanaticism: "My wish is finally finished. Great Sen Black goat, your servant is about to offer you a sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge and Roland leave the city to return to the city center, Su Ge whispers Admonished: "Escaped a ghoul, the situation we investigated is estimated to be completely exposed, you must be careful in your next move, or simply do not act, find a place to hide."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded hard, took the hat down and quickly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned to look at the Cathedral of the Holy Blood in front of him, but did not know if he should go in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Su Ge feels that this cathedral is no longer the safest place in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accurately, there is no safe place here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug, how are you here?" A clear, happy voice sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge heard the sound, just to see Ivan carrying a large bag of things from afar, the look is happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Ivan, Su Ge suddenly thought of one thing and hurriedly strode up and asked: "To Ivan, I want to ask a thing, this It’s critical that things are urgent, you must tell me truthfully.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan immediately nodded hard and said, “Okay!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should have been to the dungeon of the Church of the Holy Blood, right?" Su Ge asked earnestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time I met, Ivan said that I would go see 3-12. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan heard this hesitant, but when he saw Sugue’s serious and urgent look, he said seriously: “Yes, I have been there.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell, how many crazy clergymen are there in the dungeon now?" Su Ge asked immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan’s temptation asks: “What do you want to do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is too much Confidential, this made Ivan somewhat worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has an absolute trust in Ivan, hugged his shoulder and whispered: "You listen well, I now suspect that there are many spies inside our church." They are secretly preparing for a huge evil thing. I just picked up some clues and need to confirm the situation in the dungeon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Ivan heard the words of Su Ge immediately, he said directly: "There are ten!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "Okay, I still have to go ahead Go back, help me take care of Lobo, I will go to you at night!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Sug turned and ran out quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug can almost say that he ran all the way to Luke’s residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came in, he just saw Luke looking at the window and thinking about something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the unsettled Su Ge, Luke asked, "What happened?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The church, there are a large number of traitors in the church, the bishop is likely to be the mastermind of the last incident, and, I found the framework of the formation..." Su Ge will immediately The thing is said again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke listened to Su Gedao with great interest: "I have to say, you are really daring."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took a sip of water: "Next I need you to protect the policewoman, Roland's safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What about you? Need my protection?" Luke asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge silenced and shook his head and said, "I don’t want to use it for the time being. I have to go back to the church tonight. When I confirm some things, I have to clean up. "Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, yes. My magic will follow you, if you encounter any threat, call me directly, calculate this distance, you Just stick to thirty seconds and I can rush over," Luke said confidently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you!" Su Ge said, immediately informed: "And, there are ten people in the dungeon now."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten?" Luke listened to his look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "Ten!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
