			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Ge walked into the dream, he first felt a sharp twist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at it, Su Ge found that the world was completely chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth is in the sky, the sky is underground, the mountains are floating in the air, the sea in the distance is not water, but the yellow quicksand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;狰狞Twisted monsters are drilled from the human eye, a dozen-meter-long big scorpion, a hundred-meter-long worm, a dragon with a fly head, All kinds of colors, strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stepped on a black rock and was about to move forward, and the rock became a big mouth, biting at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge did not move, the big mouth suddenly broke, and then quickly reorganized under the control of Su Ge, turned into a cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon with the head of the fly in the distance is still thousands of miles away, and the next second suddenly comes to Su Ge, the disgusting mouth In a strange angle, he actually got out of Su Ge's mouth and turned over to eat Su Ge himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is totally unreasonable, and it does not fit any rules at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is a dream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this dream is only a dream for the dreamer, and for the dreamer, everything here is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s an ordinary nightmare, this person is dead now, or just died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Su Ge is not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Retreating!" Su Ge was suddenly and quietly heard by the mouth filled with a few hundred meters long dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, this monster suddenly disappeared, turned into a butterfly of the sky, and spread out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stepping on the clouds, Su Ge moves forward in a twisted dream world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way, he saw a huge scorpion that ignored the space and saw some people falling from the cliff of 10,000 meters, but it was unharmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also saw that the previous step was still in the city, and the next step was to return to the ancient times full of horror monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even there are countless rotten corpses that piled up and swallowed each other, and finally turned into a fist-sized eyeball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All common sense has no effect here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is not a sleepwalker, he quickly found the source of this dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a fifteen-year-old girl who was wearing a dilapidated dress and was struggling to escape on a country road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl is very beautiful, blond, like a doll, is definitely a beauty billet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very pitiful, running, crying, mourning shouting father and mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind her is a group of church costumes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is because these are not people, but disgusting monsters dressed in church costumes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They keep chasing the little girl, screaming with a piercing mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the little girl finally ran to her own home, constantly tapping and crying, only to find that she could not open the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding monsters are getting closer and closer, and the little girls are more afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When desperate, the door finally opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just fluttered into her father’s arms with a peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they found out that there were two men and women who had no face. They grabbed the little girl and gave it to the monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the whole space began to tremble, which is a sign that the nightmare is about to wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the crucial moment, the desperate little girl suddenly felt the scene turn . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster is gone, no face is gone, she comes to a pink room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of rag dolls that she has been longing for, beautiful clothes, delicious food, just like heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No!" The little girl wiped her tears and suddenly whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the little girl grew up quickly, from a girl to a slim beauty, and then her face became deeper and became a middle-aged woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Women, really all are beautiful." Su Ge sighed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This witch should be around 50, but still in her thirties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hair blue, face oval, big eyes and high nose, mature and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a mistake to be ugly in the last generation. In this world, long and beautiful is wrong." Su Ge sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horror of the witch's body is gradually spreading, and the calm and low voice sounds: "Come out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Suge came out from behind the three-meter-tall teddy bear and said calmly, "Hello, Ms. Frost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are Who wants to save me?" Frosty face with a hint of hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "My name is Suger Sotos, a friend of Ms. Sonic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Sug Sotos!?" Hearing the name, the frost was full of shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard who just guarded her is still discussing the legendary bishop who is arrogant and has a different approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Sonic is now 30 meters away from you, in our camp. Her legs have been seriously injured and she is being treated," Su Ge said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frost is a bit nervous: "Why do I believe in you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can save you Go out," said Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just going to go from one hell to another."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can at least go out, don't go out and die, and maybe there is hope of living after going out," Su Ge said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frost silence: "What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's change a place first! Su Ge said, hit a finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, the frost felt the surrounding scenes began to blur and rotate at high speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few breathing rooms, she found two people came to an elegant cafe, two people are sitting opposite each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the environment?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frost said faintly: "The environment is good, that is, no one, too fake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then come to someone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said another finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, there were guests in the empty coffee shop, wearing shirt vests and waiters serving the plates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear greetings and conversations came from all around, and the frosty eyes tightened, and the heart was full of tension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means makes her feel tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please use two!" A waiter came over and poured a strong coffee for the two. After smiling, he turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The information says that the legendary bishop is a pastor. Who can think that this legendary bishop is a dreamer." Frost is holding the coffee in his hand. Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not admit, nor denied: "I need to know your position, your own situation, and your configuration."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frost said directly: "I am now in the underground cave of the Nighthawk Church Base Camp. The body is tied by a rope woven from black wool and Mithril. All spirits. Can be sealed, and even the fingers can not move. It is good that they are afraid that my outside world will be irritated and not abused."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am surrounded by an iron cage, which should be made of chrome-silver steel, which has strong mysterious resistance and is stronger than steel. The lock of the cage linked to the ground can not be taken. The key is in the hands of the archbishop, surrounded by There are four thieves holding hands all day, two in a group, six hours a week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sip of coffee, feeling no smell, the frost is somewhat boring Say: "Unless you can pull out the big battalion of the Nighthawk Church, otherwise Then almost no way "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;".. Words can not say too full, there are many ways, just think of it "Scotch random said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frost came to the interest and asked, "What do you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Actually This question is very simple." Su Ge laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How simple?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three steps are enough."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which three steps?" Frost is more curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first step is to dispose of the church, the second step will open the cage, and the third step will take you away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frost has a beautiful eye: "Are you teasing me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge looked serious: "I seem to tease you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frost silence for a while, said: "Whoever says, but the details and problems can be It's not that simple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some things are essentially simple, but humans like to complicate their imagination." Su Ge said, getting up and doing it After a while, the cafe disappeared, and two people stood in a misty mountain, the misty mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be a big event here, and it may even cause shocks throughout the continent. Do you believe it?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose said: "Believe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The frost did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because Ida Newton?" Su Ge asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frost double eyes suddenly tightened, the fists concealed tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sound waves have told me that you came here to find the whereabouts of Ida Newton." Suge lie like drinking water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frosted brows: "She is very cautious, can't believe you so much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Maybe it's because I have a witch sister, just as my sister found a badly wounded sound." Su Ge said casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your sister is a witch!?" Frost was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge swayed: "Not a sister, but there is no difference in relationship with a sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Can you tell us their codename?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dragon, Steel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that the two of them are not dead, they are hidden by you!?" The frosty look is even more shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
