			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching the second ha, Su Ge’s mind tidy up his dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, he felt more in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some purple sticky ones that seem to be liquid and seem to be neat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what John said about psionics!" Seeing this Su Ge remembered the knowledge that the undead warlock gave himself results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychic is the energy generated from the spirit, the driving force behind the combination of people's soul and mystery. They are the fuel and cornerstone that motivate the mysterious power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha! So I have already entered the mysterious field in advance. Sure enough! My dreams and reality are connected, I am in the dream through the body of the gods The things that are parsed have also come true in the real world. In my dreams, I have solved the knowledge of the soul sound, and I know the principles and modes of communication, and how to control these sounds simply."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen, generate, spread and control, this is my current ability, although it can not cause substantial harm, but at least can interfere with others, the key moment can save my life." Su Ge Speaking of excitement and clenched fists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I don't know what the so-called occupation is, I do have the mysterious power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; After confirming, Su Ge remembered the things of two poor witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to memory, Holy Blood, Heal, Nighthawk, the three churches have a zero-tolerance attitude towards the witch, but they never let go of the witch's body." The name is afraid that the land will be contaminated by the witch, but this is certainly not the case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In view of the current medical situation in the world, surgery has become popular, then The church that got the body of the witch will certainly be dissected and studied. For so many years, they have definitely discovered the obvious sarcoma of the witch's chest, knowing the truth of the witch's variation, but they did not announce the matter."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the experience from ancient times to the present, behind this behavior of desperately concealing the truth, there must be great interests and secrets beyond human imagination." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a lot of clues that are missing, but I don’t think so, but this matter is still confidential. If it leaks out to cause the church to oscillate, maybe There will be any arrogant characters who can find me directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart trembles: "This matter is in your heart, you can't say it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge opened his own drawer with two palm-sized golden banknotes inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden paper is also engraved with the mark of the Church of the Holy Blood, which is the official currency of the Empire: Langke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face value of this krona is 1. But don't underestimate this 1 gram, the purchasing power of this small banknote is very amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you eat normal gray bread, potatoes and vegetables, and eat meat once in three meals, you can let Su Ge eat this meal for seven meals. rice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the only Lange in the hands of Su Ge, and the rest are piecemeal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carefully put Langke away, Su Ge thought about it and ran to the small balcony of the living room, opened the wooden cabinet inside, and took out two looks very bulky Gray thick coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the warm winter overalls that his parents used when they were working in the factory. They are completely aesthetically pleasing, but they are very warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the parents died, they have been pressed here. Fortunately, Winnie’s heart is fine enough to do the work of preventing moisture and insects. The two coats are not damaged now. There is no smell that is too bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take off your coat and suit, put on a very ordinary gray cotton gown, don’t wear a hat, use a large suitcase to put two Put a coat in. After thinking about it, Su Ge poured a pot of boiling water into a small thermos bottle at home, and wrapped two cups in the middle of the coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Gejun Erha said: "I will be back soon, I will look after my family. Come back and I will buy you delicious food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha! Ha! "Two hatons were happy, and they were on the floor, and they looked like they were looking at them." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s eyes twitched slightly: “I’m thinking about riding a gun and going out to force you, I always feel a liver pain.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lock the door and Su Ge walked out of the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, the school in Maple Street is not far from here, and it is very remote now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;First went downstairs to the bakery to buy two pounds of gray bread, bought a large bottle of butter and two bottles of canned fish, put the prepared insulated woven bag into the box, Su Ge licked the box quickly go ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maple Street is just across the street behind their apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is really the edge of the city, a completely abandoned old town. Among them, factories, schools, and houses have been scrapped and ready to be demolished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the city's plan, there will be a single-family villa area that is ideally suited for the middle class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now is the time to go to work, there are few people on the entire abandoned street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge walked and listened to all the sounds around him to make sure he wasn’t being tracked by church staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be on the safe side, Su Ge didn’t even go straight in, but ran to the side of the old house for a lap, even turned over and covered with dust. The dilapidated wall looks like a tramp looking for someone else not to waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that Master Geralds is right, there is really a shortage of people in the church." Su Ge made a lap to confirm that it did not attract anyone's attention. Zhengda Guangliang walked into the abandoned school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole school is now covered in snow, but there are many footprints on the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
