			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Vanas’s indifference at this time, Su Ge did not feel any discomfort, but was very satisfied and happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he needs is not a beautiful vase, but a person who has real talents and can give him great help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today's Vanas, perfectly meets all the requirements of Su Ge's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having enough knowledge of death, counted as inheriting part of the power of the gods, with sufficient qualifications. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking is in a semi-god and half-human state, with some advanced thinking and vision, but also able to understand humanity rewards and punishments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy is hot enough, full of gas, rich in ruling experience and political means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge thought for a long time about leaving the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were only three people in the church, and the one who rushed the ducks to the shelves became the lowest and most tiring Pope in history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the development of the number and the gradual fullness of the church system, Su Gedong ran west, doing the position of the pope, doing the work of the missionaries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you bless the church members, you need to bring them in, and you will be blessed with the eager panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessing is done and you have to change back quickly and take people out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others don’t see the feeling that the problem is not big, but Su Ge feels very bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are now qualified to see me directly." Su Ge said with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas became the Pope, and later blessed, the matter of gathering believers is her work, as long as you concentrate on doing a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas heard this, the eyes of the darkness finally had obvious fluctuations, and the face of the high cold and arrogant was nervous: "I really have this." What kind of qualification?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, the Pope is the spokesperson of the gods. In the future, you are qualified to step into the temple and lead the lost people to feel the power of my master." Su Ge said, his heart smiled and blossomed, as if he finally found a replacement. A simple worker who works for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Vanaseton was so excited that his face was awkward and asked: "That... that... what should I do when I enter the temple?" I am not going to bow down? First, whether it is a left foot or a right foot, how many angles should the body be suitable for? Is it appropriate to change clothes? Is there still hair to cut some? And..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, Vanas is cute and asks some very clumsy questions, like a normal girl who is at a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at Vanas’s look, Sug smiled: “Don’t think so much, you look perfect now, the Lord likes you very much now. The form."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Vanas’s soul trembled, and the white face blushes and turns to bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, Vanas quickly returned to normal, watching Su Ge ask: "How come you enter my dreams safely? Here is In my field and study place, a sneaky person entered here yesterday, and I was directly pinched to death as soon as I came in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge Says: "The Lord has given me a lot of special powers. The Lord has the power to master dreams. Entering other people's dreams is the foundation of the foundation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas Slightly nodded, I was a little surprised, and had some curiosity about Su Ge’s identity and form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Holy Blood Church comes to investigate you, two people, the lead should be the lord level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suge heard a flash of light in his eyes: "It’s really grand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He used some monitoring methods to integrate dark monitoring to make the magic scattered In the palace, I did not move those magical sorcerers, so as not to stun the snakes, and pay attention to some in the next few days," Vanas reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge thought of the dark spot in the corner of the wall, and nodded slightly to receive it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This matter should be told to other relevant believers to prevent accidents." Vanas has now taken up the work of being a pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and looked at her perfect side face, just as the dark hair was scattered from her ear and placed on her chest. With her cold and glamorous face and deep and indifferent eyes, the female emperor is full, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the real female emperor, this is the real superior Su Ge’s heart sighed, and there was a subtle feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the feeling of being conquered by a certain temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you looking at?" She noticed Sug's gaze, slightly sideways, and the corner of her eye looked at Sug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug returned to the gods and blinked, laughing: "Go, mainly to see you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas used to sigh with a nasal sound, and the body was very cautious to return to the Kingdom of God after Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the Kingdom of God, Su Ge was happy to sing a little song. At this moment, he had an indescribable sense of ease, as if he had been on his shoulders before. The mountain was taken over by Vanas and relieved. The whole body is light, and it seems to jump to the sky with a single hop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounded knights felt some accidents when they saw Vanas at this time. After they recognized Vanas, they were shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This matter has been solved, it can be regarded as a cure for my heart." Su Ge thought, walking into the temple with Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second time Vanas walked into the temple, and the feeling twice was completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time she only felt the indescribable power of gods and horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, as her level increases, she feels more detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had knowledge of death between each other. At this moment, her face gradually became pale, and then her face had a morbid ruddy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she felt it, the real horror of the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the knowledge of death is a drop of water, then the knowledge of the Lord is an indescribable sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is not only one sea, but four! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can barely feel a desperate sea, and the other three she does not even know the qualifications. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Humble servant Vanas Guinness meets the great Lord, the glory of my Lord shines." Vanas squatted on the ground and shouted. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has returned to the throne at this time, sitting there with a long gun, nodded slightly: "Get up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vanas once witnessed the incomplete body of Su Ge, and Su Ge also sealed some of the power at this time, otherwise these two words will make Vanas's spirit collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas did not dare to hesitate, respectfully, folded his hands on the flat belly, his body leaning forward slightly, his head down, like a The servant who saw the emperor was full of worship and piety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood up and said: "Look up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas has nothing to take The idea of ​​not being offended, the command of the Lord is everything, and she has dedicated herself to the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly raised his head, his dark eyes gradually widened, and after more than half a year, she finally saw the figure of the stalwart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick and delicate silver-gray armor is attached to the strong body, and the left and right shoulders are two statues of the wolf head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grey helmet covers the entire head, and the silver-gray ghost mask is endlessly majestic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the cloak hunting and flying, the streamering rifle is like the origin of the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special metal boots stepped on the steps, Vanas looked at his god from the incomparable majestic throne, and the ten connected to the dome next to the throne The huge wings are like behind him, grand, majestic, and magnificent gas field encroaching on her everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vanas, you performed very well." Su Ge walked off the throne at the moment and came to her, solemn and heavy voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas's white temperament, a grateful, happy mood in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instinct, she used a nasal sound, then immediately felt her own gaffe, and hurriedly added: "The servant can have today, thank the Lord for his love and Mercy. Without the Lord, there is no servant today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at Vanas here, he found the sarcoma and other witches in the chest of Vanas Not the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those things are sarcomas, but more of the knowledge and atmosphere of the condensate, can even be said to be the core of the knowledge of the god of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this sarcoma that is constantly nourishing Vanas’ body and improving her form and consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Surely all gods have the means to make witches. The ancient gods are through parasites, and the great gods are through the core of knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s calm and cold question: “What do you think of taking over the Pope?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas sinks Immediately, answer immediately: "The wisdom of the Lord is as deep as the abyss, as high as the sky. The Lord's decision is always the best decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not Very curious, Su Ge is an ordinary person, why is it qualified to meet me, is qualified to take over my power?" Su Ge asked faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas did not dare to have any concealment and nodded: "The servant does not dare to hide, there is indeed doubt in this regard, please ask the Lord to punish."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
