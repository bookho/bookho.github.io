			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scratch the beard, Su Ge looked at the clean and clean in the mirror, and the young man with a soft expression nodded with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability of the priest has a small influence on the temperament of the human being. At this time, Su Ge looks softer than before, like a big brother next to the sun. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Diet!" said Black outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenny gets up early and puts the breakfast in the incubator. Black, who was too lazy to eat alone, had already got up, but he still waited for his brother to eat together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hair is neatly combed, and Suge is sitting at the table with a refreshing look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breakfast is very rich, the fragrant bacon, the gray bread with fish sauce and butter, and a glass of milk and an omelette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black smiled and said: "Recently, Winnie has done a lot of light in order to give you a body."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge’s heart is warm, sighing: “You’re almost out of your private money?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black knows no I lived in my elder brother and said with a smile: "If you don't have any more, you can earn more. Compared with buying a piece of clothing, your body can be more important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen This, Su Ge, the fork of this fork, slightly pinched, and said with a smile: "Become your brother, I am really fortunate in my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are the same, brother." Black is right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After breakfast, Su Ge, who was suddenly idle, was a little confused and didn’t know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black did not have any activity to continue his studies, he started a serious study with his drawings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted to be a mechanical inventor since he was a child. He has a natural hobby for machinery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not bother him at home, put on loose casual clothes, put on a hat, and kneel down and said, "Luobo, do you want to go out again? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard that I was going out, I just got excited when I came back to Hartton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lobo is the name of today's Erha, whose name is Winnie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four days ago, Winnie came back earlier, and at dusk she took her two haha ​​out for a lap, and she encountered two stray dogs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dog was ready to attack Winnie, Erha rushed up very hard, and after a few times he couldn’t get up the two dogs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a wolverine, and the terrible dog was scared to the ground and did not dare to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This suddenly shocked Winnie, and then ran back to the eagerly to say this thing, then directly gave this look of a strange second Topped the title of "Luobo". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luobo is the legendary cold wind elf on the north-north wind continent. It used to be a snow wolf, and it dominated the wolves of the entire north wind continent. Even in the original "death era" to help humans eliminate countless monsters, but unfortunately they were tempted to kill by cult people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lobo is the central figure in the ancient legend of the entire North Wind continent, and is the prototype of countless tribal totems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legend of its heroicity is widely circulated throughout the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, this two haha ​​has thus won the title of the strongest wolf king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I went out for a lap, and it broke me in the past few days." Su Ge said with two ha, no, it was Lobo who left the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Su Ge did not bring anything, in the form of a hyena, with Luobo rushing into the wasteland, spreading the scorpion and running towards it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These days are not small under the snow, but fortunately there are some carriages and pedestrians passing by the countryside to open up the roads in the wild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luobo running is very excited, it is like Su Ge seeing it for the first time, running like it is completely different, like a gust of wind , chic and neat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After running for about a kilometer, Sug couldn’t move, and he was wearing a rough face and flushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Lobo still has a look of insatiable, constantly jumping in the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abandoned factory covered by heavy snow at this time is already in sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the above white footprint, no one is here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With two hahas, I climbed up from the side to the ditch that was filled with snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snow simply dig out some of the snow, revealing a hole, Su Ge rolled in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This door is still the same as before, nothing changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the door, Su Ge first felt the warmth of the atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The popularity of this life, it seems that the two witches have no problem." Su Ge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After opening the door, I first saw a darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s ear was keenly heard of two heartbeats in the dark that tried to hold their breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's me, Su Ge." Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Apostle Adult!" Two clear and pleasant sounds, and the kerosene lamp that was subsequently extinguished lit up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge saw the two girls coming over, he suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are... Hills? Bernice?" Su Ge followed the lights of the kerosene lamp and suddenly caught the two men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in front of him is no longer the two ragged, yellow-skinned wandering girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a beautiful woman with two fair skins, well-proportioned and beautiful appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men were not wearing heavy coats at this time, but wearing worn-out sweaters that didn't know where to find them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills ice blue hair is combed into a ponytail, the standard melon face with white skin and blue eyes looks like a water elf . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Bernice's purple long hair is behind her, although she is a little younger, but suddenly a mature temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forehead was blocked by the bangs half, a pair of purple Danfeng eyes with a tall nose and a clear lip, giving a feeling of high cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Chuck's eyes are really poisonous! This is where two beautiful women are, two beautiful people!" Su Ge sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills hurriedly patted the dust on his body and cautiously asked: "Apostle, are we doing something wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unspeakable Su Ge makes two people nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug returned with a smile and said: "No, don't think too much. I just didn't expect both of you to be so beautiful."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the two suddenly turned red and bowed their heads and said, "Thank you for your compliment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; &nbsp; Su Ge walked down the steps and asked: "How have you been in the recent period?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills hurriedly said: "Very good, very good. This is the happiest life we ​​have ever had in more than three years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis followed and nodded and said, "Yes, it's good, really. Very good. Here we can sleep peacefully, warm food, and even melt the snow to cleanse the body, we are now very satisfied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su The grid nodded and then asked: "Where did you come from?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! A village in the distance a few days ago died, held After the funeral, they took the dead Clothes still in the wilderness, and that night I was preparing to get back to the point of washing laundry in the snow, just to see, just to retrieve a "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
