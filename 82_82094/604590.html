			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twelve people who were about to be taken out looked at Drake. When they heard this, they felt an indescribable feeling and almost cried out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the attention of everyone, Drake came out of the crowd with a heroic image, with a firm and calm face, looking at Marchi Asked: "How about my advice, the high priest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, Drake’s heart has turned over, and now he feels he has come. To the peak of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From small to large, eager to pay attention to others, eager for others to admire, he has realized his dreams now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of excitement even completely covered his inner fear, making him look like a real hero who sacrificed himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...this is the real hero!" At this time everyone looked at Drake's back, and his heart was full of admiration and admiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Markey looked at Drake in the righteousness, and said in his heart: "It seems that Assin and he said something, but did not tell him to face. The fate of right. Since you want to be a hero, it is just right to deal with you first, let the Son of God link with the consciousness of Cthulhu, and then the effect of the sacrifice is the best."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Marchi said calmly: "Good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, under the guidance of Marchi, the cultists on the side The twelve people were put back, and Drake was taken out in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you! Thank you!" The twelve people who were rescued said that they were very grateful to Drake for a snot of tears. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreek has completely fallen into the role played by the hero, calm and softly said: "Do not worry, there is me, you will not have something." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, everyone in the room feels a little more at ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this desperate time, there is a great hero who can stand up to save others and appease them, the effect is very obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malki made a look at several cultists, let them optimistic about these people, and then personally took Drake out of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going out from the hall, there is still heavy rain in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bow of the large deck, the statue of Kesulu, which has been wet by the rain, has become two meters high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around this statue, there are dozens of short fishmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are covered with thin scales, each about one meter high, licking the body, arms and backs covered with spurs, two The big claws are as sharp as a razor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the Yi who worships Cthulhu, a deep dive who needs 25 points to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time these deep-slugglers lie on the ground and continue to worship the statue of Cthulhu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people just came out, Drake saw these monsters, suddenly scared face pale, screaming, sitting on the ground, from the hero The shell fell out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!? Where did the hero of the heroic fearless go?" Markey said with a smirk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreek heard this and hurriedly settled his spirit. The voice trembled and said, "This...this...what are you doing?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Markey grabbed his neck and smiled and said: "Do you want to be a sacrifice instead of them? I just fulfill your wishes."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, dragging his body onto the deck of the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't! Don't! I'm just kidding, don't! I really don't like being a sacrifice, my heart is so dirty, the great God. I can't see me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔嚓! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning flashed, and the thunder light illuminated Drake’s face to cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of rain fell down his face, and it seemed that he was still filled with tears of his fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Markey heard this smile: "Don’t be so arrogant, it’s that your filthy talent is more likely to connect with the consciousness of the great God, or how the Son of God Will your body be treated as a lair?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God? What god?" Drake heard this suddenly stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, he suddenly thought of the horrible dream he had done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dream, he was stuffed into a scary monster in his stomach by this group of monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreek thinks that this suddenly trembles, the brain A blank, I don't know how to be good, even the words and countermeasures that Su Ge and he said are completely forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Markey dragged him to the statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that a huge array of incomparable figures has been drawn around the statue. The lines of the array are drawn with the smoky dragon scales and there are twelve around. The independent circle represents the twelve sacrifices that need to be sacrificed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, there are enough sacrifices in these circles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks like the nausea of ​​some creatures and fish, and what is not clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Markie pulled Drake, who was completely scared, and stuffed him in front of the statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statue is right in front of him, the scattered tentacles just wrapped his head, the two wings gathered like an eggshell in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment before the statue, Drake felt an indescribable terrorist force to hold him firmly, no matter how he struggled Any effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, a force like the horror of the sea gradually entered the body through the statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't! Don't! I haven't slept until the noble lady! I haven't made a name for myself! I haven't lived a high life! Don't! Mr. Assassin, I don't want to be a hero, save me! Save I!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time Drake screamed loudly, his voice was crying, his voice was cracked, and he was terrified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Assassin? He has been disposed of by me. No one can save you now, and no one gives you the opportunity to be a hero." Marchi said a very cruel fact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the struggling Drake suddenly froze, like a sculpture, and his eyes gradually spread, like a dementia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Markey stepped back and said with a loud voice: "The great god of sleep, the god of the sea, the Lord of Lalaiye, the great god, your Servant, your followers pray to you, offer sacrifices to you, offer you a throne, wake up! Come on! Bring the end of the world, bring redemption to all mankind! The great and wise true God! Cthulhu! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Booming rumbling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sound of prayer falling, there was a burst of intense thunder The sound of the sound exploded, like the sky is covered by the thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the rain is even bigger, the sea is starting to choppy, as if there is something incomparably described that is about to appear, even if the storm-class ocean-going tanker starts to be fierce The shaking is like a ship going over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, everyone on board was caught in a terrible panic, shivering and afraid to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the swaying reaches the most violent, a hugely blurred figure comes from the sea to the ship, bursts of intense fog from Drake’s body, and statues The spew came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several breaths, the large cruise ships were all wrapped in fog, and the swaying hull gradually calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain is still down, but the fog does not mean to disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter!?" Marchie's eyes widened, and the fog around him fell into a deep surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
