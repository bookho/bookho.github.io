			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After setting the goal, Su Ge did not let himself stay out of the way, but naturally integrated into it, observing the movements of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lively party lasted until 10:30 in the evening. What surprised Su Ge was that there was no special incident in the whole process, and everyone was performing very well. Normal is a bit strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at the end of the day, Su Ge found the target. At the same time, in the dark corner where Mary was kidnapped, three clergymen looked down at the blood-hunters who had died completely and fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three clergymen seem to be a group, one man and two women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is tall and tall, wearing a priest's robes, only with a vague light, some turbid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his left is an exorcist who wears a nun's dress and holds a double knife. In the eyes of the mask, there is a turbid light that is similar to the priest of the gods. It seems that the clean eyes are contaminated by something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the right is a woman wearing a purple priest robes, looks pretty mature, especially a pair of eyes, giving a strong feeling, like an imposing Aggressive police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Su Ge is here, he will be surprised to find that this is the three people he knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three are his old acquaintances, colleagues in Bain City, Father Anthony, Mother Marlene, and the policeman Roland who became a clergyman by the police. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just died more than two hours, the same as in the order." Roland said the blood of the blood-sucker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Mary carefully sensed and opened her eyes and said: "The soul has completely dissipated. It should be a direct attack, or a mysterious spell that plunders the soul."<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Anthony first wrapped the body in a special bag and said on the shoulder: "Go back and report it."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said, three people quietly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three of them were transferred from the city of Bain to the capital three months ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that because of the changes in some people, the city needs to strengthen the defense of the mysterious system, and began to deploy elite clergy from churches across the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three experts who were all experts were sent to the capital by the bishop of Bain City. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people today are senior elite clergy, and a group of three people secretly protects the security of the capital as a position of the church’s non-public reinforcements. About an hour ago, three people received an order from the Holy See, saying that a cleric of the church died in the residence of the Duke of Merris and sent three people to come over. Investigate and recover the body at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people rushed to prepare, then rushed to the fastest speed, through the secret door prepared by the government for the clergy, and found the clergyman. The body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smallly leaving the house from the dark door, Roland turned and looked at the high-end carriage on the road that looked far away and said: "It seems that the party is over, the murderer It should be among these people, do we need to investigate?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marine shook her head: “We don’t have an investigation order now, most of these people are A big person with a well-known social status can easily get into trouble by taking the liberty of investigating and tracking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland did not speak, she did not have any affection for these nobles, for the church More uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has her own beliefs and has her own church, but she can’t say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these two people are close to the church and are very trustworthy, but without the teacher’s order, without the Pope’s order, she dare not say Anything out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cautious, self-discipline, self-discipline, this is the three core points in the doctrine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking a deep breath, Roland sorted out his thoughts and expressions and left quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the three people gradually left, they felt a hint of mysterious fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at each other, the three did not say much, first put the body on the carriage, let the driver first transport it back, the three people followed the subtle mysterious wave The south gate of the mansion is moving in the direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s manor is large, and the South Gate has been separated from the bustling area of ​​the center, surrounded by bushes and the walls of the high Dalian apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a hidden corner deep in a tree, three people gradually discovered the source of mystery, while hearing the violent gasping and snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people look at each other and are a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the three of them were still hesitating, the sound came to an abrupt end, and even the mysterious fluctuations completely disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" The physical battle of the priest Anthony was shocked, and he rushed into the bushes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland and Marlene did not say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people form an elite squad, have been acting together for a year and a half, and have a very good understanding between each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While rushing into the bushes, the three men simultaneously pinched their weapons and mysterious materials and prepared for the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;沙沙......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moonlight, the sound of the three people’s clothes and the friction of the branches and leaves Extra clear and harsh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than ten seconds, three people came to the inside, a seemingly hidden place of love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, two men and women who were not well dressed were completely comatose, and next to two people, there was a young man in a black dress with a wooden cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can't see the youth, but this young man is elegant and refined, and looks like a social celebrity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the three people just arrived, they just saw the young man bent down and stretched out his hand with black gloves, pinching the neck of the beautiful woman with a disheveled dress. , pick her up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stop, don't move!" Anthony and Marlene immediately picked up the hunting gun in their hands and aimed at the young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man’s side, the vague face, after seeing three people, clearly felt his look, then the blurred face seemed to smile happily stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked at the youth's look and brows, and did not rush to shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She felt an indescribable intimacy on the body of this person, as she saw her family in a strange world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she knows in the next second that this one has the same faith and the same church as her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man here still seems to be laughing, his hand let go of the woman’s neck and make a squeaking voice: "I am not malicious, nor a bad person. This woman is a corpse. Ghost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remove your disguise, or we will attack immediately." Marlene tightened her body and squeezed her hands with both hands. Some strange black shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people see this, the tone seems to be somewhat helpless: "Today is not convenient, I will go first, let's see you next day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, don't wait for three people to return to God...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clear finger suddenly sounded in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people instantly felt the spirit is a little fuzzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that only one second has passed. When three people have returned to God, the youth and women have disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
