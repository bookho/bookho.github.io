			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continued: "The book he got was called "The Praise of the Giant Worm.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Six-level magic book!?" I was shocked when I heard it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singer of the giant worms they have heard, it is a taboo book about the knowledge about macro worms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continues: "The giant worm is a believer in the black goat of Mori, and Ron found a way to summon the black goat of Sen."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That magic book!?" Laurie asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly said: "It is now in an absolutely safe place, safer than anywhere else in the world."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father still looks at Su Ge with a smile, indicating that he will continue to let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" He has been preparing for a long time, through a secret relationship, he contacted a very radical branch of the Institute of Polar Studies and the Green Flame Brotherhood. He used the grail document of Bain City as an attraction to attract these mysterious people and help them summon the original fire through the enthusiasm of the Green Flame Brotherhood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What is the relationship between the original fire and the Mori Black Goat?" At this moment, Ryan, who had been silent, made a hoarse voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at him and said faintly: "The original fire has many other names, and it is itself a member of the outside god. Ron does The purpose of this summoning is to test whether the summoning array can communicate with the astral, and he needs some things in the astral as an anchor to open a larger portal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When we arrived, the original fire had already formed. We joined the Green Flame Brotherhood headquarters and the original fire was surrendered, but it was attacked by Ron. He took away the symbol of the original fire. The green flame skull, and my people were seriously injured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I heard this, everyone was full of shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Laurie, Dark Star and others are clear about the blurring of that matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are your purposes for doing this?" asked the Holy Word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge spread the handkerchief: "There is no purpose, I grew up in Bain City, naturally I can't let them succeed. Stop them as I am a citizen." "The responsibility should be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should immediately inform the church that you were already a clergyman." Dark Star scolded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just said, Dark Star immediately knew that he was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at him with an idiot's eyes, and suddenly let the dark star's forehead burst, but could not refute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, the entire city of Bain was full of Ron’s men. If Su Ge informed the church rashly, it was estimated that he had died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father asked: "Through that thing, have you joined the Church of the Night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge tilted his legs and casually leaned back on the chair with a proud expression on his face: "I didn't join, because through that, I created the church of the late bell."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, someone at the venue was shocked, and his eyes widened and he looked at Su Ge in amazement, just like hearing the most incredible thing in the world. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How powerful and horrible the church is, they are very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In their cognition, the people who created the church in the late bells must be a terrible, at least dominator, and even a great figure at the Great Sage level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now, they heard that it was Su Ge who created this church! This suddenly made their world view collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg’s attitude continues as usual: “I realized from that incident that your church in March was unreliable. The big church has been completely rotted. There is no way for you to give people shelter and give this world salvation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you a little too arrogant!?" Upon hearing this, the three bishops suddenly looked gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger can say that they are named after the surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked directly at the three lord-level horror figures, faintly asking: "Is it not?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The three Archbishops also explained, but they were interrupted by the Holy Father: "That is to say, when the original fire is called, the world and the door of the astral are instantly opened, and the resonance is caused?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." Su Ge nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people heard this and fell into meditation, which is somewhat far-fetched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continued: "You don't know the true horror of Mori's black goat. You are still only when he is an ordinary god."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Gewan is as condescending as the disciple teaches his disciples: "The gods are different from the gods you know, and each of them is far behind. Beyond our imagination, but it is still divided into three or six."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original fire, also known as the great green inflammation, the dancer of the flame of life, it The flame can easily burn the whole world in an instant and devour all life. But He is just a dancing flame in a horrible palace, and that one exists, even without a shot, only a single voice can The whole world has been destroyed countless times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, everyone in the room couldn’t help but speed up and bounce twice, and his face became pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are real strong, Su Ge is sighing at the moment, his eyes are firm, and there is no special fluctuation in his heart and brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that Su Ge is telling the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father was not very good at this time, and he asked seriously: "What is the relationship between the one and the black goat of Mori."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge looked at everyone's appearance, his posture was even more arrogant, and he talked awkwardly: "The one who gave birth to three sons. These three sons and gods, including all the gods, including the original fire, are the black sheep of Mori. One of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop, Su Ge said: "If you compare the astral to a god country, then the original fire is just that country. The ordinary people, the existence is the king of the country regardless of the matter, and the three below is the actual ruler who rules all the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to this, all the bishops in the field rose two points, and the three archbishops, as well as the two old monsters, grew a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just imagined briefly, they only know how terrible they are at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, everyone was silent for ten minutes, digesting this horror to a desperate secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They know how high they are, and they know what it means to make their own growing knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After? What made her get out of trouble?" The Holy Father continued to ask, but his voice was a little hoarse at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surges calmly continues to explain: "The second time Ron succeeded, he engraved the genus on the giant worm, and the macrophage worm parasitized In the body of the citizens. Afterwards, the entire Bain city was blocked by the formation method, which broke the inner vision system of the city and let the public see the appearance of the giant worm, which led to the madness of more than 100,000 citizens."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!? And this thing!?" Moore heard that he suddenly stood up and looked angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lost Fortress, as an international policeman, has been investigating and paying attention to all major events, but he did not expect that the blockade incident in Bain City was actually noisy. So big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three bishops bowed their heads at this time and did not know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other bishops also bowed their heads and did not dare to look at Moore’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father's face became pale and painful at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This expression, when experienced just heard of the gods, did not show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continued: "I saved a group of people with me, and at the end of the bloody month, the Factions absorbed the energy of the goddess of the bloodmoon. Start, through about 30,000 people as sacrifices, with the circle of the Cathedral of the Holy Blood as the base, the door leading to the stars opened. Then they summoned the life outside the field, the lowest level of the Mori Black Goat, the most Weak children: the dark son."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The existence of that level should have reached the level of demigod." The Holy Father said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "He is not dead, no attack in this world can kill it, because He is a life outside the realm, the law of this world is not Apply to Him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did you deal with him?" Laurie asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge faintly replied: "You don't need to know this. You just need to know what you want to know."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie did not continue to ask questions, bowing his head and meditating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ryan was calm at the moment and asked: "What is your bell?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger said casually: "There were several undead people who asked me this question. I didn't answer it. Do you think I will answer you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Ryan slowly opened his mouth and said with a gloomy face: "Do you think you still have the qualification to refuse?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course. Su Ge answered with confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, everyone’s eyes were once again attracted to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They still don’t see through, what makes Su Ge so confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father looked at Su Ge seriously: "I hope that you can stay in the church, I can talk to the Pope, not only will not affect you, It can even be promoted and closer to the Holy See."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
