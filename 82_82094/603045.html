Your faith in the Lord of the Yellow Emperor will not be shaken, even if I will Everything is in vain, and you won't say anything useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I understand, I am very clear about your thoughts." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge’s face is proud: “Because I understand, I dismiss the information you know.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The king of the great yellow coat will certainly sanction you, you will never escape the suffering of the sand!" Moss looked awkward and slobbered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge licked his ears: "Can you be a bit new? This kind of discourse I have heard ears must be scorpion."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Su Ge said to Sherry: "Give it to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl After listening to the satisfaction of standing up, the darkness beside him rose up and turned into countless horrible monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 7:30 in the evening, the party is introducing the mask host The official opening of the curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many people in the large conference hall, there should be four or five hundred people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they are eligible to participate in this party, they all have a certain status and identity, and they have reached a certain level of consumption on this ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People’s clothes are in different shapes, with different masks on their faces, with wine glasses in their hands, or two or two standing together, or alone One person is looking for his own goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banquet hall is divided into three levels, except for the lobby, where the second and third floors are the venues, which accommodate the four One hundred people are very rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger and Sherry are standing on the second floor near the fence and looking at the people laughing and laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melodious music fluttered in the hall, and Su Ge looked at what seemed to be waiting around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the people are laughing and laughing in the lobby on the first floor, and some are on the second floor of Su Ge. Generally, such people are all female companions, looking for a slightly hidden corner to do some exciting things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third floor is about the same as the second floor. Those people are either looking down on the fence or sitting down and talking about it. what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his own head, Su Ge did not release the night bell to detect it. He looked at the circle and said, "I saw a few acquaintances."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw Drake, who was taking his fans and talking with a few ladies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also saw Duke Hausman leaning on the second floor of the pillar, enjoying his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert took his follow-up on the third floor and looked at the situation condescendingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pigu with a mature middle-aged lady is happy to talk and laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also saw the sexy red lady who had met at the casino before, and also saw the opera actress, Miss Mary, who had a good voice and looks good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not that these people are not wearing masks, but that Su Ge is recognized by some special means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you waiting? My child said that the speed of the ship’s navigation has dropped a lot, and it has started to rain,” said Shirley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly and asked: "Is there a deep dive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “No.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said: “Wait, the means I have arranged have not yet reacted.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge’s eyes looked to the opposite Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite Duke is very upset at this moment, and the statue in his arms is like a bomb that can explode at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was uneasy, he felt a keen eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he saw the gaze, his heart settled down and he said in his heart: "Mr. Black Mist, you are so reliable."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just in time of contemplation, a sideguard came over and whispered: "Master, there is something wrong, you need to see it yourself."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke brows slightly wrinkled: "What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodyguard looks a bit ugly and says: "I can't say it." You can see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke’s heart jumped, then followed the bodyguard and left the hall along the second floor passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg, who looked at Duke’s back, saw this smile: “The good play has begun.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a deep dive on the sea." Shelly said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go! The time to shape the hero begins." He said, walking toward Drake on the first floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, Duke and the bodyguard walked quietly into some dimly lit corridors, and Duke felt something wrong when he walked, so he stopped. The tone said coldly: "I am very disappointed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sturdy man collapsed on the ground at this time, crying and crying: "Master! Master! I don't want to die! I really don't want to die!" I still have a wife, I have a daughter, if I am dead, what can they do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke looked down at his leg and cried The rogue bodyguard said calmly: "Come out, it will be boring to continue hiding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of high-heeled shoes hitting the floor came out of the corridor, and then a tall, some strong woman came out from inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke turned his head and looked at each other and tightened his eyes: "I didn't expect that the deputy captain of the Saroni was actually a cult leader."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The visitor is not someone else, the deputy captain of the cruise ship, Marchi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Marchi said with a relaxed smile on his face: "I didn't expect that you could be so calm."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke opened his own bodyguard and said faintly: "The change is not the basic quality of the businessman. Since the deputy captain asked me to come here, it means that it is not for me." Life, but to do business, as long as it is profitable, businessmen generally do not refuse business."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Markey patted his palm and said with a thumbs up on his face: "It’s a hidden card of the Hausmann family. Who can think of you? A little son who is ugly and introverted will become the only designated heir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke has a slight contraction and has not spoken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Markey also didn't want to talk nonsense, reaching out and saying, "Let it out, the guy has told you what it is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
