			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two hours, everything subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is very cool, very cool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the coolest two hours of his life, which adds up to fifty years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process of Su Ge did not lose consciousness, he was only rationally suppressed by the animal nature, unable to control his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like drinking and drinking people, it’s clear that self-awareness is clear, but because reason is suppressed, talking and doing things don’t go through the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first he was a little scared, but as time went on, when he felt the amazing touch of his hands, and looked at Shirley’s turn When he looks like, he suddenly has an indescribable sense of pride and conquest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is deeply embedded in the inner instinct of every man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lying on the ground, looking at Shirley lying on his body, the big hand is still unscrupulously kneading on her back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley's body is shocked by the heavens, no matter the vision, the touch is perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the soothing kneading of Su Ge, her skin does not have any bruises and scars, except for the slight redness of the skin, as before That way, it is as smooth and firm as a jade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Shirley put his hands on the chest of Su Ge and sat softly, his black hair sprinkled, and he could see the white and seductive behind. Big white rabbit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hair is like a waterfall on the chest of Su Ge, and Shirley’s ruddy mouth is slightly tilted: “Do you like it?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded very frankly: "Like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there a taboo pleasure? It seems to happen with my sister. The relationship?” Shirley seems to be very clear about the relationship between Su Ge and Ada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge put her hands on her lap and said, "I am not a brother and sister, and my three views are very positive. I have no interest in the ethical stimulus."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley listened and smiled, then stood up and waved, the black breath condensed into a slightly tight robes, wrapping her perfect body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugello took a pity and put on his clothes and asked: "Your strength does not seem to be affected."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desire to get poured, Su Ge is very calm and rational at this time, into a true sense of the time of the sage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley gave him a blank look: "For a cockroach, normal humans and seriously ill humans do not differ."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge was somewhat embarrassed by her damage. She carefully looked at her and found that she now seems more like a person. The temptation of the previous temptation has almost disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most critical thing is that the powerful atmosphere and distortion have completely disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These signs indicate that her previous few powers have been further stripped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are now a real person." Su Ge tied the button on his shirt and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley reached out and touched his face, then squeezed his fist: "I am even weaker than the normal human master."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge prevented this from being shackled, did not speak rashly, and looked at her for a few seconds and said: "You consume too much energy when breaking the concept shell. You know a lot of knowledge, but you are already human, you have to convert the energy you used before into psionic energy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley holds his hands on his chest Road: "You still have some brains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, Su Ge suddenly remembered one thing: "I remember you told me before, to Give me a huge trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Shelly suddenly smiled amazedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is you!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, that's me." Shirley slightly Take off your chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge slaps his head: "The Holy Father knows your plan, so I will kill you. Now it is estimated that the church's reinforcements have arrived, and broke your black. Goat's egg. That is to say, next we will face the lords of the church in March and the top lords, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Of course, you have to protect me, I can't let me hurt a hair. Because I became like this because of you." Shirley was eating Su Ge at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg is not the kind of ruthless person who does not recognize people when he pulls out, and his feelings about Shirley are too complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, the church will not let me go anyway," Su Ge said, turning to look at the altar, the Holy Grail that had been left out for two hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time the Holy Grail seems to have some sadness, the light has disappeared, and it has become a pyramid of two dark gold opposites. Not flying, quietly on the dusty altar, giving a feeling of "I am angry." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge was able to recover some of the spirits at this time, feeling a little embarrassed, and quickly walked up and reached for the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Holy Grail suddenly moved slightly, missing Su Ge’s hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is speechless and looks back at Shelley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley spread his hand: "Don't look at me, I am just a weak woman who has just been degraded."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, also refers to the blood that is not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge grinds his teeth and suddenly reaches out, but is escaped by the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this holy grail a second Han?" Su Ge was full of depression, reached out again and was escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is only one glove in Su Ge, he can’t have both hands at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I saw that like a mouse, Su Ge’s hands are constantly being caught, and the Holy Grail is constantly moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay!" Su Ge screamed and tried to make the remaining lingering power in the body scream a heavy, low bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, the trend of the movement of the Holy Grail is obviously slower, and Su Ge seizes the opportunity and suddenly reaches out and grabs it in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of being caught, this dark golden holy grail suddenly burst into an indescribable light that instantly enveloped Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, Su Ge heard a horrible whisper, and there was a burst of horrible sorrow around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge opened his eyes and found himself standing on the body of an indescribable giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This huge thing doesn't know how big it is. The ground under his feet is as rough as the book cover, showing a strange dark red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless mourning souls flying around, making terrifying horror screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sneered, and the bell of the night bell came out of the body, followed by the blue mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the god of death that emerged from the abyss of the valley appeared in this strange space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night of the town's soul is constantly coming out, accompanied by the bells scattered, the black feather of death is constantly floating in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, those mourning souls are like seeing their masters who have not seen for many years, snoring in the mouth of the ground and whispering something that Sug can’t understand. vocabulary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumble...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the indescribable giant began to move, and Su Ge felt his position rise instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action of this huge object is very slow, but because it is too large, even if it is gently moved, it is already a distance of more than ten kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and moving a dozen kilometers in a second, the horrible wind pressure almost crushed Su Ge’s body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is a form of death after all, stubbornly resisting the wind pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, Su Ge discovered that the continent he stood on, but it was a savings for a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time the savings lifted up and lifted Su Ge to his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg looked up and saw only one eye as big as the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't describe the look of this eye, he can't describe the color and look of this eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beep! Hey! Hey! ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the voice of heaven and earth sounded from all directions, Su Ge felt as if the whole world was talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four wings stretched, and Su Ge jumped up, and the continuous release of the late bell formed a huge sonic sphere with a diameter of more than two hundred meters to protect himself in the middle. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't understand this, but he can feel what it means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This horrible presence signals him to look up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the sky as he meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, he saw three incomparably huge meteorites descending from the sky, squatting on the distant land he could not see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless souls began to tremble and mourn at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge faintly felt something, so he pinched the declaration of the Great God in silence and suddenly lifted it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔嚓! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Booming...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a flash of lightning, Su Ge felt countless souls with Happy and comforting came to myself, and then the kind of safe, happy emotion filled his heart and made him feel very comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;恍惚Suge opened his eyes and found that the Holy Grail in his hand had disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flip the palm of the hand with black gloves, and Sug sees the center of the gloved hand, the slightly raised mouth, biting firmly A very small and delicate golden hourglass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are flush at the moment, and they are slightly raised on the glove, as if they were fixed on a badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle, Su Ge feels that his spirit is linked to an indescribable great existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the burst of light, the Holy Grail is the source, and the black gloves flashed a lot of silver-gray lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all the lines on the glove were full, he entered his body along the skin of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃呃呃! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the seven scorpions on Su Ge’s face were filled with this silver-gray light, and then the light came directly to the heart of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the heart suddenly shrinks, and countless rays are sucked in like blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a diastolic, countless rays ran through his body through the Suger blood vessels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few times, the light gradually subsided, returned to the glove along the blood vessels, and finally converges by the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge is refreshed at this time, the psionic power of the serious deficit has been fully restored, and even faint, his knowledge of the soul of death is further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
