			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bes Street, Bernice's home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the lunch table, a family of four people ate while eating and talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benice reports: "Just Green has sent someone to send me some news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Iyeta went to find him?" Su Ge browed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis nodded: "From the news, he is showing you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Bernice said something about the conversation between Green and Iyeta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard a smile and said: "It’s not an admiral, not only smart, but also very round."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can see it, Green is helping himself, although rashly tied himself to him, but it does have a powerful shock for Iyeta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta is very important to Suger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The late bell church said that it is necessary to shelter heresy, but now among the official members, there are only four female warlocks, and there are few pitiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta is an opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the female warlocks, the number and strength of the Fuguo faction are not small, and these female warlocks are very active. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta is a firm resurrection. After she is taken down, Su Ge can find a gap. Through Iyeta, all other female warlocks will be found. Into the shelter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the church of the late bells proclaimed to the outside world, in this world, the enemy of mankind is not his own compatriots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger is also the same now, he hopes to condense more power to destroy those who are the Yi, and the evil spirits that cover the whole world in the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will be fine next time." Su Ge finished, continue to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dinner, when Bernice hurried away, Sug called her and stuffed a box to her: "Give you, you can use ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict stunned, looked down and opened the box and looked at it. When I saw all the contracts, I suddenly opened my eyes: "This... How did you get it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge laughed: "Someone else sent it, since it was sent white, there is no reason to do it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis pinched the box and asked seriously: "Do you know the value of this contract?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge nodded: "A little understanding. Rest assured, the guy is rich. Duke Hausmann, you should have heard the name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Bernice nodded: "They are all screaming, the leader of a new generation of young people, the absolute central figure of many banquets, and many times I have looked at it in the distance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl Said: "He will soon join you taught, did not have to look far up." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp ;! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Shirley widened his eyes and looked at Su Ge: "Adult, this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Shouge laughed: "It should be faster. After he joins, the pressure on your side can be much smaller. At that time, you don't have to work too hard, enjoy a lot of life. I used to replace my master like you." The promise should be accelerated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of Bain City, Su Ge had been able to let them live freely, with their own will Do not feel the beauty of the world without the eyes of anyone else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benice heard this, and the tears flowed down in a moment, and the cockroaches fell on the box, so incomparably pleasing . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his hand and touched her head: "Don't have too much pressure, you are all my lovely children and people, go!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bernice wiped her tears, her eyes were firm and happy, she didn't shout any slogans, and in silence she bowed to the respectfulness of Su Ge and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the back, she can see that her pace is so relaxed and so enjoyable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the back of Bernice, Su Ge is also full of happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis and Hills, like his two sisters, the special kind of care that no one else can match. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl lying on the sofa asked lazily: "Where are you going in the afternoon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Still at home." Su Ge said, sitting next to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley did not have any objections, lying comfortably on the sofa, enjoying his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought you would come up with a bottle of blood and wine to share it," said Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl grinned: "This wine is not something they can enjoy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge After listening to the sigh: "The tone of your concern is really awkward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl’s words are very contemptuous, but it contains a lot of concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wine is too expensive and too delicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary people only need to drink a few mouthfuls to be deeply addicted to it, and finally addicted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this wine is not affordable to ordinary people, which is prone to problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like those who are addicted to xi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it will cause so many bad troubles, it is better to not let them touch from the very beginning, which is the best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl said: "I can understand that it is their ability, I can't bother to explain so much."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge smiled and suddenly he had a glimpse of his spirit when he spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Shelly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s face is not very good. “Just like the inspiration seems to be overpowered, through the soul of the Holy Grail, it seems that someone is looking for me through astrology.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Through astrology? What level?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is estimated that at least the lord, even the dominator Su Ge whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley said faintly: "It seems that some of the bugs can't stop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At the same time, in the center of the city, the tallest and largest Basilica of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old man wearing a patched robe is sitting in a chair with wrinkled dry skin under the messy hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the table in front of her, there is a black crystal ball full of stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point one of the stars is constantly flashing violently, which seems to indicate something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is in the capital." The old man opened his mouth without teeth and made a weak voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the old man, stood a few people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop Laurie, who has been taught with Su Ge, is among them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two people around him who are similar to his costume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forefront, there is a man in dark red dress with a golden cloak and a burly figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man had a cross-shaped quirky helmet on his head, only a pair of dark eyes were exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has gold gloves in his hands and a gorgeous cross sword at his waist, which looks like a gold warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
