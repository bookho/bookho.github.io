			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the Sardinian family, the two did not continue to take the car and went home to eat along the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Su Ge opened the door, his inspiration faintly felt like some eyes were watching himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, not a pair, but a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the traces of closing the door, Bernice, who just arrived home, handed a note to Sugg, and said with a dignified statement: "I just called with that one. Ieta’s lady’s book was met, and according to her intelligence, the female warlocks were ready to shoot at Niya.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niya Adeline’s students, and Bernice is a classmate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do they know the identity of Niya?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis nodded and said: "It seems to have been known for a long time, but I have never found a good opportunity. Now they want to bring Niya in and get the steam union. Help. If Niya disagrees, Niya’s identity will soon be revealed.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes flashed a glimmer of light: “I’m going to Two days to deal with them, since they take the initiative to find death, then do not need to be merciful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benice went on to say: "There is one point, Mei seems to have I found out that Ieta’s change, many core contents have excluded her, and the businessman Pigu has also left her control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge Turned around and looked around the house and said: "For some reason, this has caused some people's attention. Which organization did you kill that night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Before pinching a bug, what is the name of it?" Xue Lier whited him. Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is speechless and touches his chin and analyzes: "According to the current situation, one can pay attention to the one side here is the female warlocks. After all, they used to eat here. There is also the possibility of the Brotherhood of the King of the Yellow Emperor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The cold-blooded church is also possible, others can't think of it for the time being."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bernice seriously asked: "Do you need to deploy people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "How are we in the capital?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are ten mysteries in the battle preparation, from the church dungeons, the expert bloody passer-by Kas is responsible. They are all zero and engaged in various kinds of work. Work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the strength of others?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All experts, follow What you mean, all the mysterious people are improving. Captain Kas has witnessed the strange cursed god, got the taboo knowledge after the madness, and the combat power is very strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge nodded with satisfaction: "Very good, let them stand by, let me take this step well, it is time to let the sacred night bell ring in the emperor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; After lunch, Su Ge took Shirley's generous carriage to the Marquis of Grasse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green listened to Su Ge’s words, and for a moment, leaning against the chair, he asked, “Is it sure?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course." Su Ge said confidently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green was silent for a moment and got up and said, "I need to communicate with my Majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just, Su Ge made his own request. He came out to clean up the secret female warlocks and cultists, and at the same time let the sound of the late bells to the capital, thus deterring the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green and the royal family here provide enough shelter for Su Ge or some interference with the pace of the Holy See. After ten minutes, Green came back and looked at Su Ge and said, "Your Majesty agreed, and at the same time promised to say that if your performance can satisfy him, he Will give you more benefits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What benefits?" Su Ge asked directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green sat down and replied: "For example, the mysterious defense work of some cities, or the privilege of giving you access and identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge is obvious The heart is moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious defense work of the city, although dangerous, is the best time to preach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the second privilege, Su Ge has no interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystery of the people in the church at night is absolutely no problem. If you use this privilege, it is equivalent to exposing your identity in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the matter was finalized, Su Ge asked directly: "Now I need to know the head of the female warlock, the true identity of Mei."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Iyeta does not know who the true identity of the leader is, even the name of Mei is false. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green said directly: "The Duchess of Merris."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Geton thought of the beautiful and dignified lady of last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is completely unable to combine that duchess with the cold and vicious female warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know why you don't shoot directly?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green replied: "There are too many intricate situations here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talk Well, maybe I can cut all these messes with a sword." Su Ge said with a cup of coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green already knows Su Ge’s determination and does not hide it truthfully: “This woman’s wrist is very strong, she links many interests and is a lot of interest. The key node."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, she secretly passed the special status of the female warlock to help the Holy Blood Church to hunt the witch." Green calmly said a major intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes are slightly enlarged: “She hunt the witch!? Help the Church of the Holy Blood?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Green nodded: "Yes, this is only part of the chain of interests. She also helped the Church of the Holy Blood to deal with the inconvenience of many churches, and through her controlled gangs, smuggling gangs, etc., got rich profits. She can live so moistly, we don't dare to move when we know our identity. The important reason is the sanctuary of the Church of the Holy Blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The woman What about the Warlock's restoration of the country?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green took a deep breath and said with a dignified face: "It is also inspired by the Church of the Holy Blood. They set up the country, located in the northeast of the north wind, where is One of the legacy of the ancient cold empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Holy Grail!" Su Ge brows a pick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugton was lost in thought because he suddenly found that the game was a bit big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green continues: "On the other hand, she is still helping the Glorious Church to secretly arrest women as saints, and secretly help the Nighthawk Church to catch some of her. Unable to control the female warlock. So her identity can now be so stable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This guy..." Su Ge was shocked and full of caution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green continues: "She has been in contact with the Cold Church recently. These actions are under the supervision of the Church of the Holy Blood. The purpose is naturally the Holy Grail. It is also why those ghouls can appear in her residence so frequently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge touched his chin and asked: "These are all underarms that allow you to tell me." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green nodded: "Yes, Your Majesty has high hopes for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su The corner of the mouth slightly tilted up: "You are treating me as a sharp knife that pierces the Church of the Holy Blood, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
