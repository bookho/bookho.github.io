			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerous Byron has always been a well-known figure in the entire Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The famous is not its powerful strength, but the handsome appearance and magnetic sound, as well as his romantic affairs when he was young. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are all kinds of affair, so many priests and archbishops are envious, many clerics secretly regard Jelos as an idol, of course, just pursuing girls of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, in terms of credit, Gerlos is still outstanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the young age, he joined the church under the guidance of the Holy Father and entered the maze of blood to become a demon hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Jerouss is like a very precise and precise scalpel. Every time you attack, you can solve the problem with speed and precision, and minimize the incident. At the end, the Church of the Holy Blood saved a lot of trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, his rich knowledge and extensive involvement in the homes of the elders are admired. He is like a mobile dictionary that seems to be against the world. He is very clear about any knowledge on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For many years, Gerlos has three nicknames. One is widely circulated in the church and is called the eye of the goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the speed and precision of Jerez's solution is as accurate as the goddess' eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second title is widely circulated in the circle of cultists and is known as the March Wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is like a wolf in the captivity of the goddess of March, who has a keen sense of smell and full patience, always hitting those cults when they are not surprised kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third title is in the mysterious world, and is called the great teacher by many mysteries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extensive knowledge, long years of age, let his knowledge and experience make countless mysterious people admire, many people visit him and hope to get his guidance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in many cases, Gerlos is happy to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher is a respect for teaching intellectuals, and the great teacher naturally has a more respectful status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Gerlos is relatively low-key, many people have heard of these three titles, but they don’t know who these three titles point to, and they don’t know these three. The title points to the same person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially after becoming the Archbishop, Gerlos rarely went out and stayed in the capital for a leisurely day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, the name of Gerlos in the Holy See spreads rapidly, and gradually he is already one of the legends of many clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss has been a demon hunter for ninety-three years, serving the church for ninety-three years, and almost everyone believes that he is already an indispensable part of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially this year, when Gerlos was fascinated by the special charm, the tulip of the tulip, he has already received more admiration and respect. Gradually walked into the center of the church from the edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the way! Is this kind of priesthood, at this moment standing opposite them? And it seems that it has already joined the church of the late bell, and even became the core of the church, known as the war apostle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not true... this is not true!" Many female clerics saw their faces full of incredulity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like the girl who opened her sinus and found that the star who has been admired for many years is actually the enemy they hate most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the world view and beliefs completely collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not just these female clergy who have collapsed, but also many male clergy who see Jelos as an idol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the shoes on the slate is constantly ringing in the dark night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss went to the side of Su Ge and slid slightly: "I have seen the clockman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At the same time, the werewolf and the vampire squatted: "I have seen the war apostles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus looked around and nodded slightly: "You are very Ok, let me give it to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he and Su Ge stood together and looked opposite, looking at the sluggish clergy, and finally The eyes fell to the three archbishops who were full of mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge slightly sideways, looking at the mature and handsome appearance of Gerlos, smiled and said: "The timing of the appearance is very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss smiled: "Is it still good for you, just those words that you thought of temporarily?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That's right." Su Ge, who had been in the middle of two years, has many similar lines in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a bell-bearer, and I’ve already enlightened my God’s power. So if you think about it, it’s estimated to think, but it will need to be very For a long time." Jelos has an admiration in his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jerouss!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people talked and laughed, and the opposite side suddenly sounded full of anger Screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turned around and saw that Laurie’s three faces were red and his face was very gloomy staring at the two people. The voice was from Laurie’s mouth. dispatched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the betrayal of the coagulator Walter is merely to make them feel unexpected and regretful, now the defection of Gerlos makes them feel unbelievable, angry, and The collapse of self-confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church of the Holy Blood has been deeply proud of its absolute loyalty for many years, but at this time Gerlos’s betrayal has made these people’s faces Slap a slap, even a punch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This punch is very heavy, not only swollen his face, but even knocked out their teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Church of the Holy Blood, the popularity and influence of Gerlos is hundreds of times greater than that of Father Water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French's betrayal can be understood as the madness of crazy people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, unlike Gerlos, he is an idol of countless people, even a teacher, he has an infinitely bright future, has a fiancee who is envied by countless people, and has a lofty Status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, he will not betray the Church of the Holy Blood anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, he is not only betrayed, even without any meaning of hiding, directly in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face, Laurie’s roar, Gerlos took a step forward and calmly replied: “I am.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why! What is this?!" Laurie asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus calmly replied: "Because hope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Gerlos is happy Laughed: "My Lord, gave me hope!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can you laugh!?" The one-eyed archbishop squinted and instinctively asked . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus replied: "Why can't I laugh? For many years, the reason why I sold my life for the church is that I am eager to restore my feelings one day. But unfortunately Yes, your group of self-righteous people can't even believe in their own people. I have worked hard to climb the position of the Archbishop, not only without any means of recovery, even without any real power. At that time, my patience with you reached At the limit, I was completely disappointed with you at that time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeros replied plainly: "You never know what my dreams are, how do you know that only the demon-hunters who have no feelings can make me realize my dreams!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When I heard this, everyone suddenly took a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you say..." The mad wind archbishop's face was full of ugliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus calmly replied: "Since everything has been clarified, then there is no need for me to continue hiding my identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Gerlos spread his arms and said to everyone: "My name is Gerlos Byron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The people looked at him and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's been the only direct bloodline that has been around for tens of thousands of years, and Byron the Great is now alive," continued Gerlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the people on the ground are sluggish, and the flame dominators in the sky are full of shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible? The blood of Byron the Great should have been cut off. The blood has been cursed by the Holy Grail of the Soul, and there is no future generation!" The dominator muttered to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side’s Father Waterer smiled and said: “The world itself is full of countless possibilities. The Holy Grail appears several times in the world, why is it only last time? Let the bell people get it? Didn’t you study it carefully?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s Gerlos! He broke the Holy Grail and the world with his own blood. Barriers! Let Him stop in this era from the turbulent flow of time!” After all, the flame dominator is a knowledgeable person, and instantly thinks about the cause and effect of the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fr. Water did not speak and continued to watch the drama quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been isolated from the world for too long, and this time he hopes to appreciate the drama of this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While seeing him now, he is very satisfied, he found the world is really interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The direct system of Byron the Great... son?" For a time, many clergymen felt a short circuit in their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is Byron the Great? That is the mysterious system that created the whole world. It is called the dream god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone has returned to God, Gerlos continued: "The blood of our family has been entangled in the Holy Grail and the ancient gods for many years. I joined the Holy Blood. The core purpose of the church, entering the maze of blood, is to avoid the whispers of the ancient gods. After all, my father killed my mother in front of me after being maddened by those who are mad."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How old were you at the time? How did you avoid those mysterious tests?" Laurie muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos replied: "Eight. The blood is a curse, but it has given me some special things that ordinary people can't touch. You won't want to use it." That simple mystery test, let's test the depth of the blood of the gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people nodded their faces, I don’t know what I knew, or I thought What is passed, or that is just a self-deprecation of yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three archbishops looked at each other and saw the ambiguity and self-deprecation in the eyes of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos continues: "For many years, I have witnessed the filth of the Church of the Holy Blood. You tamed the cult and maintained your status as a rule, in order to satisfy yourself. The lusts of the devil define the poor people of the witch as heretics and arrest their sacrifices for the evil ancient gods to acquire knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" In this case, Laurie immediately stopped it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it’s all too late, and the loud voice of Gerlos has been passed on to everyone’s ears, and even passed a lot to the audience. In the human ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
