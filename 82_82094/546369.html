			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do we get that key point card owner?" I asked seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyan replied: "The door is removed. That door is like a shaft that flips the middle of the hourglass. If the shaft is cut off, the hourglass cannot be rotated. Always keep one side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laun asked again: "But that door, we have no ability to take it down now."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have it, I have it." Ryan said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, everyone has a glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having experienced the despair, they are very clear about how strong the door is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father said at this time: "Next, you have a good rest and rest, the next time the whole staff is dispatched, take the ancient city in one fell swoop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" The three archbishops immediately said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resume!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then everyone left the camp and prepared to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge followed the crowd and left, with some contemplation inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Holy Father was looking around, he seemed to be very stealthy and took a glance at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may seem unintentional, but it’s totally different here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he is very aware of the thoughts and plans of the Church of the Holy Blood today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason they haven’t done it to him now is because he still has some value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city has been detected almost, and there are two very terrifying strong existences, in which case his value is gradually lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now, the Church of the Holy Blood may do anything to him and grab him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father had just looked at him with great care and caution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he is thinking, should not leave here directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, Hills and Alger have left with Randall and they have rejoined, leaving me and Lobo in the entire camp, if If I have any problems, I can leave without any concern."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But now there are many strong people here, and in the dream my cards have been leaked out. If you continue, once I find out what is happening, I estimate that there is no possibility of escaping."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge’s heart immediately got alert and looked at his eyes. Around, I found no one to pay attention to myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then go quickly, staying on is risky, not worth the candle." Su Ge thought about going back to his camp quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Erha is lying on the ground, and it seems that the spirit has recovered very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said: "Go, leave here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up, the eyes sparkled with excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone else is gone today, it’s boring to die, and it’s naturally very happy to hear that the owner is leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked around and the important things have been taken away by Hills and others, and the rest are some dispensable food and tool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nodded, and after leaving nothing, Su Ge took the two haha ​​out of the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just coming out, Su Ge saw the holy godfather looking at himself with a smile, and came to himself in a few steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge’s heart suddenly fell, but his face changed and said: “See the Holy Father.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The Holy Father smiled and nodded. He looked down at the second Han next to Su Ge. His eyes were even more amazed. The voice said softly: "Let's talk together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge turned his head slightly and looked at Mr. Lane, and there were people such as Laurie and Dark Star who were secretly warned not far away. They smiled and said: "It is my pleasure to talk to you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father then took Su Ge to the center’s conference camp, and soon more people entered the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the Archbishops of the March Church, Bishops, Deputy Bishops, Moore, Bells, and a small number of elite armed men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the original empty camp was full of people at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people faintly surrounded Su Ge and Erha in the middle, with a bad face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please sit down." The Holy Father sat down and said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and shook his head: "You are respectful, I am standing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Holy Father looked around and finally looked down on Su Ge and said with a smile: "The twenty-five-year-old master, which is one of the few in the history of the church throughout March. They call you a legendary bishop, a little It’s not too much.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the clerics around were suddenly surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially Moore, Horace, Dark Star, etc., their eyes are slightly enlarged, and it is incredible to see Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie and the Holy Word are also somewhat surprised at this time, because the speed of Su Ge is really scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From his exposure to mystery to the present, it will take more than a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore’s eyes turned slightly and looked around, and he said in his heart: “It seems that they really want to start.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Moore brows slightly, and he hesitates whether he wants to help Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because at this moment, he has already felt faintly, and there is a certain relationship between Su Ge and the person named the church of the late bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nowadays the church’s actions have made him very fond of the fact that the nature of the church in the late hours is very similar to that of their fortresses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher looked at Su Ge's look a bit complicated, the rough palm was constantly groaning, not knowing what to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When everyone was shocked, Sug smiled: "It’s all a name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Holy Father looked at Su Ge’s natural and calm smile, and his face was more happy and gratified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a pity that they were preempted." The Holy Father’s face smiled, but his mouth was full of regrets, saying nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the camp that just had a calm atmosphere immediately became quiet, and it could even be said to be dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of unspeakable pressure is on everyone's mind, even those priests faintly hold their arms in their hands, staring nervously at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is still very calm, he can understand what this means, the corner of the corner of the eye slightly looked at the situation around, calmly replied: "There was no preemption."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a low-pitched Lourie asking, "Are you acknowledging?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you admit?" Su Ge calmly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Admit that you have a relationship with Mori's black goat." Laurie's tone is like a mountain-like oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg is still standing here, but obviously can hear a squeaking sound, as if Su Ge suddenly becomes heavier, pressing the floor under his feet Broken in general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not that Suge has become heavier, but that the pressure on him has grown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge remained the same, and a thick bell suddenly appeared in his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bell with a special power directly broke the pressure brought by Laurie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, the dark star suddenly jumped, he was very clear how powerful and terrifying the spiritual pressure of the Lord’s level, but what he did not expect was that Not only can you withstand this kind of pressure, but also destroy this kind of pressure by your own means! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master and lord, the gap between the huge gaps cannot be described. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bell!?" Hearing this voice, Sitting in the side of the Holy Father, Lenton suddenly changed his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the undead, the bell represents a special meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others heard the bells gradually change their face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father’s face with some emotions, asked: “So, are you affiliated with the church of the late bell?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This question is asked, everyone is holding their breath and looking at Su Ge, and his heart is full of expectations for how he should answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this sentence is answered, it can be said that it determines the life and death of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not answer directly, calmly said: "You can understand this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen To Su Ge’s direct recognition, Moore and Bells suddenly fell in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Su Ge died, they could still help Su Ge to speak and even save Su Ge through his own force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they did not expect that Su Ge was so straightforward and generous to admit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three archbishops did not speak, quietly watching Su Ge did not say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should you release the Mori Black Goat?" asked the Holy Father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge did not answer directly. At this time, his body gradually became as straight as a javelin, like a person who tore off all the disguise and reveal the true appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperament of his whole person quickly changed from the humble and courteous cleric and the younger generation to a gas field, calm and confident, just like a person standing on a cliff On the top, one person is proud of the superiors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it’s already broken, there’s no need to hide it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing such a huge change in Su Ge’s temperament, the three bishops frowned slightly, they determined that Su Ge was a master, they did not know what made Su Ge can face When it comes to such a horrific lineup, it shows such a gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge’s eyes are full of deep light, calm and calm, and the Holy Father replied: “It’s not the release of the black sheep of Mori. I, but your own people, my people, have already said before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard this, Laurie whispered: "The nonsense." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father calmly asked: "How to judge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because today is clear, I also rarely tell you the truth." Su Ge said, taking off his hat, putting down his cane, sitting calmly in the chair, like a teacher who just came over to teach the students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This action, and the words that Su Ge just said, formed a huge contrast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clergy around him was a little angry, but he saw the Holy Father laughing and saying, "This is the best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sorted out his thoughts and said: "All the source is the last bishop of Bain City, Ron. His spiritual vision has turned over because he reached 88 points, and he found it from some special channels. A magic book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic book!?" Laurie glanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the record, there is no mention of Ron’s magic book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said faintly: "What you know, though true, but I have hidden a lot of key things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
