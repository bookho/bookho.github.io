Shelley felt that Su Ge’s eyes were a little weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug returned with a smile and smiled: "Happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I humiliate it And happy?” Shirley’s lips with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl did not say much, continue to eat the last piece of beef. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene doesn't know why, it's a little warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared with the warmth of the two people, the hall is very embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man’s face is very ugly at this time, sitting there with a sullen face, and the palms of the palms are violently squeezed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And other people who are just getting ready to start calming down at this time, while secretly watching the fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a gentleman, I care about my face. The perfect gentleman should always be so elegant and calm, not rejected, not rude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two minutes later, the middle-aged man took a deep breath and his expression gradually returned to the restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just out of the restaurant, his face was gloomy and said to a crew member: "Give me the identity of the two people, especially the woman." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" The crew nodded respectfully, and saw Su Ge and Sherry quickly leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Su Ge’s eyes glanced at him and wiped the last bite of the fish to wipe his mouth: “I don’t think I can avoid the cliché bridge? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What cliché bridge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With peerless beauty, being empowered The people look at it, then play the pig to eat the tiger, smash a face to force the face, under the gaze of everyone, the hero saves the beauty, sits on the beauty." Su Ge said freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley blinked: "Is this very cliché? According to so many human novels I have seen, this violent flip is very novel and wonderful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"...The author of this era is really poor." Su Ge has some speechless channels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After lunch, two people left the restaurant under the watchful eyes of many people and followed the corridor on the side of the ship to the wide deck in front of the hull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, a corner of the edge of the deck gathered some people, among them was a young man in a dark blue suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man is holding a book in one hand and a pen in one hand, and he is talking richly and talking about something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the two people approached, they just heard the young man talking:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"............ Cthulhu lives in the city of the sea, Laleille. In many legends, it is the center of the world, the starting point of redemption. It is rumored that Cthulhu is the god of sleep, and can give faith to the power of believers through dreams. In some remote coastal tribes, many people are worshipping Cthulhu and think that he can bless them in the sea. I have been to several villages, and there are even rumors of descendants of Cthulhu. They seem to be a group of degeneration. The fisherman, between the fish and the human being, they have a strong power in the sea, but they are very weak on the land..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heard the youth said More and more mysterious, people around us suddenly left without a break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of these elites only believe in technology gods, and even a large part of them do not believe in mysterious existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the bard was just talking about the legends they hadn’t heard, then the fisherman is the bard himself. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no interest in this unrealistic fantasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Don't go! Don't go! I'm all true! Why don't you believe it! Really fish!" I was anxious to see this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, these people have no interest in the stories they have written. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd quickly dissipated, and Su Ge was very surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly calmly said: "What is good about a big octopus?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge said calmly: "The big octopus naturally has nothing to listen to, but those fish people are more interesting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fish people? Deep dive? "At this time, Albert's voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned his head and watched Albert come over with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, do you know the deep dive?" Su Ge nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert responded: "The deep dive is almost the first group of discovered Yi people, only need 33 points to see it. Deep divers have a lot of research."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nassulu and Laleille?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After mentioning these two names, Albert’s smile suddenly became stiff and then sighed: “These two names are generally linked to some bad things. Together, don't mention it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Geton was more interested and smiled: "If this is the case, then it should be more Having said that, for many years, we have been searching for information about these gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the words "we", Albert suddenly remembered The mysterious organization behind Su Ge that is powerful and horrifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the three churches, this church will be the core means of confronting those outsiders in the future, and its status can be compared to the abyss of the Wolf Legion. The city of the chaos of the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert said: "There are many legends about Cthulhu, but this god has always been mysterious. We don't know that He is What kind of existence does not know whether he belongs to those evil gods that are not outside the astral world. Although the popularity is very high, the relevant information is very rare. We only know that the deep-sinkers believe in this god, and at the same time his power and The ocean is related to dreams."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There are some cults who seem to believe in this god, and the most frequently spoken word of this god is “when the stars are right.””<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this Su Ge asked casually: "What happens when the stars are correct? Is the world destroyed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alber features nodded: "It is really the destruction of the world."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old-fashioned, they really are the other gods to eat dry food? Want to destroy the world, first pass the March goddess this level." Su Ge mouth band Laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert smiled: "Yes, so almost no one cares about them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What about Laleille?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert smiled and said: "This existence is the same as the presence of Cthulhu, the legendary Kesu Lu lives in the depths of the sea, the city of the sea, Laleille. Its existence is the same as the former Byron City, and the tower at the end of the world, no one can prove that they really existed."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s mouth carries a mystery: “No proof, it doesn’t mean they don’t exist.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary worship Luncheng, he has already been there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, Laleille is definitely there, but wherever it is, humans don’t know it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right! There is a horrific incident when it comes to Laleille," Albert said suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said: "You said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There were cultists in a small fishing village A summoning ceremony was held, hoping to summon the god of the sea to give endless knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The result is that all the people in the small fishing village have mutated and fell into It’s crazy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This means that the cult leader has succeeded?" Su Ge stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert nodded solemnly: "Yes, they summoned a great inhuman existence from the sea, rumored that the great existence came from Laleille."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Later?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Later they took away the great existence and left the sea in order to ask for more knowledge. After that, the great existence died in the hands of the cultists."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They killed the god they summoned?" Su Ge was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This behavior is completely incomprehensible in terms of this worldview. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert shook his head: "It’s not intentional to kill, but because of excessive demand, and death from the sea. Those cults have fallen into a huge In self-blame and self-doubt, they then sent his body back to the sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, no matter how many times they sent the body, how far, that The body will float back on the third day. This situation lasted for three years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After three years, that great existence has gone through numerous drifts , gave birth to the child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After three years of death, gave birth to a child?" Su Ge heard this expression even more weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alber features nodded: "The deformed child has an indescribable terrorist power and curse. He cursed everyone in the small fishing village and the descendants of those people. When we and the church discovered it, it has become a terrible inhuman land, and the curse is spreading."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the result?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The result is that the three churches have teamed up to completely seal the place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The deformity What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert’s face is extremely dignified: “The church joined forces to crusade four times and four times to die four dominators. Finally, judges, The deformed child has entered the field of the gods. Although it is very weak, it is not something that we humans can touch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge had a great interest and hurriedly asked: "Where is that place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert bitterly shook his head: "I can’t say it, I can't think of it, I can't write it, because we all signed the contract."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like the ancient city event?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ancient city of Bia is more serious." Albert said very seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep thoughts that Su Ge’s heart has fallen into. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Shirley suddenly said: "Disgusting fish smell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge turned her head and looked around, and seemed to see a huge shadow flashing through the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that!!" Su Ge trembled in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley gave him a white look: "A whale."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you What is the smell of fish?" Su Ge frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl said casually: "I don't like you frowning and scaring you there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"............"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert’s face is dignified: “I advise you, don’t invest too much in this matter. The curse According to the records, all the priests who participated in the operation were cursed and cursed by the blood, and they continued to grow forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is it similar to the birth of a child?" Su Ge asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert didn’t know that this was a swearing word, he thought very seriously, and answered seriously: “Although there is no such curse, it is more serious than this. And a lot of trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How serious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Physical variation, loss of reason, can When it comes to birth, the baby is no longer a human."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
