			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time does not know how long it took, and Su Ge left the strange space and came to a gray world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment he seems to be standing in front of the gray wall and can't pass the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing in front of this wall, Su Ge can barely feel the connection between the god and the body after the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This wall should be a barrier to reality and dreams. If you pass this barrier, you should enter the dream with another attitude, and establish the gods." A deeper connection, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge reached out and slowly groped on the gray wall and kept thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This barrier cannot be broken. On the one hand, my mental strength is also psionic failure, on the other hand, it needs to pass more intense The ritual can temporarily break this barrier and open the channel of reality and dreams!” Su Ge gradually figured out the core issues of today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge did not waste time here, withdrawing from this quirky realm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your eyes, the first thing you see is a beautifully decorated ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a deep breath, he felt that he was inferior in spirit or in the flesh, and even the trauma of Oliver’s attack was completely restored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just sitting up, Su Ge saw that Hills looked excited at himself and said happily: "Sir, you are finally awake!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long have I been in a coma?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost ten hours." Hills calculated the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and turned to walk lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The strength of the body does not seem to increase, but there is a lightness that cleans up all impurities." Su Ge stepped on a soft carpet. Thinking in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Hills next came: "Sir, you seem to be different, you have to be mentally prepared!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug eyebrows pick one : "How is it different?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills hurriedly turned to the side and picked up a mirror, facing Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge looks in the mirror and looks awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time he found that the color of his hair and eyes turned black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Such like this, is it because of the black death scent?" Su Ge thought of a possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills said with a smile on his face: "Sir, when did you get a tattoo? The pattern is really good."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard back to God and looked down at Hills’ sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw some dark lines on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These lines form a circle in the chest directly in front of him, and there are radial black lines around the circle, like a sun that is emitting black light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the left and right shoulders, there are two dark inverted triangles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, the area is not very large, and the style is normal." Su Ge sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow! This is more handsome!" Hills suddenly looked at the back of Su Ge in amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge heard this heartbeat and hurriedly turned back to look at the mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too much!" Su Ge felt a bit bitter in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind him, there is a very elegant black clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big bells are vivid, the tiny lines, rivets, materials, and even the overall image are very three-dimensional, and look like real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of patterns on the clock, the pattern is based on the blue cloud, in which you can faintly see a lot of wandering souls, dead monsters, and a vague figure wearing a robe and holding a big sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This big clock has a large tattoo area that occupies almost two-thirds of the back of the Suger. More eccentric, on the sides of the top of the big clock, there are two pairs of dark wings, a pair of shoulders that extend to Suger, a pair Follow the sides of the neck and extend over the shoulders to the collarbone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this big clock is hanging behind the Su Ge through these four wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell is this?" Su Ge felt a pain in the liver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tattoo looks really handsome, but...I am a clergyman, which cleric has this strange thing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Su Ge asked God: "How is the situation outside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The inner area is still shrouded in the breath of death. We went out to test it. The average person will die completely in it for more than half an hour. Even the mysterious person of Vigania, without any protective gear, insists. It’s not an hour.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In addition, many souls in the city now have entities, become things like demon spirits, and there are plenty of things that have not had time to bury and rot. The body was infected with the breath of death, which caused activation and continued to wander in the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and said, "Go out first, let I think about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, sir." Hills listened and retired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit back to bed, and Suge closed his eyes to check his status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no reinforcement in the psionics, and the body does not have any reinforcement, but the mysterious knowledge and power of the night-time prisoners have been greatly increased, and late." The clock and the heart have been merged, and the coordination of the body, the spirit, and the night clock has reached a new height. The physical capacity of the body for the late bell has been partially partial."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Said, Su Ge raised his hand and reached out to the palm of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aftermath of the night bell appears, but this time they do not appear in a diffuse way, but in this coordination, through the vibration of the psionic body in the flesh In the right hand of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turned to a red solid wood table, and the palm of the hand slid down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This table is like a number of hits that do not know how many times, and suddenly fall apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Su Ge’s eyes suddenly lit up, and then a sense of accomplishment and a sense of accomplishment that mastered the key formula came into being, and then he felt The spirit of his own has been sublimated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expert-level night bell was executed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this step, Su Ge naturally can't just stop and start to sort out and summarize the knowledge quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new range of knowledge has three aspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first aspect is the physical transmission of psionic vibration, which is the ability of the Su Ge experiment. The source is the fusion of the flesh and the evening clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect is an in-depth understanding of the soul form, including the soul's voice, the soul's volatility, the composition of the soul, and destruction. The source has witnessed a lot of destructive and regenerative processes from the time of mental assault, as well as the analysis of the late bells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third aspect is a preliminary understanding of death, the boundaries of death, and the formation of death. The source is from the analysis of the whispering of the night bell, and the feeling of blending the breath of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The night clock is fine in this area. But there is still a problem with the knowledge of death. Although there is a lot of death and some basic knowledge in my body, Lack of critical core knowledge as traction, unable to form an effective and complete system, and now there is no combat capability in this area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge seizes the key "The key core of the present is to have some connection with the gods to get some critical knowledge of death and form a complete and effective system."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't continue to delay, and you need to quickly implement the next step."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Su Ge quickly put on a white shirt, Assassin Master System, Black Suit, etc. Related equipment and clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing the black gloves, Sug picked up his cane and moved his two faces to satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the heart has been coordinated with each other, Su Ge can feel very warm and affectionate on these two equipments, just like these two Equipment is part of your body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of the micro-motion, the cane instantly switched to an iron umbrella form suddenly opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug, with the handle of the handle touched the texture, then waved both faces and satisfied: "This umbrella is a very strong shield, so even if it is late After the bell was broken, the umbrella also provided sufficient protection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close the iron umbrella, and Sug turned his head to look at the right hand glove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sensation of the psionic power, a group of cold flames burned directly in the palm of Su Ge, and the two cold flame elves wandered around his palm. It radiates a cold, cold heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close your eyes and feel a warm, full of vital energy in your gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This energy is that he absorbs the life energy of Knott and John, and can feed his body and heal the wound at a critical moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is certain, after the preparation, Su Ge strode out of the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just coming out, I saw that Hills was dancing and Vegniya said the handsome tattoo of the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge came out, Vegginia saw a sudden glimpse of Su Ge at this time, and then he said to Hills, "Oh, You are right, it’s so handsome.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she moved back, she saw that Sug’s hair had turned black. But she did not expect even the pupils to become black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
