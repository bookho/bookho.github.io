			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the prayer, Elena clearly felt a soft psionic wave, and then a chilly scent in the air was as purified, completely disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling is very mysterious and very comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she returned to God, she found that Su Ge had put the female nurse’s skull in her right hand and placed her hands on her abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a wound full of body blood, but this body has a smile on the corner of his mouth, giving a clean and peaceful impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The anger and the yin of the soul have been purified, and the frenzied and guilty souls have been redeemed. Your prayers are better than The prayers of other churches and a book are still useful," Mil said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stood up and smiled: "The core is not a prayer, but a sincere and sincere heart."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, is your faith the Lord of Death and Storm?" Elena asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "Yes, this is my only belief now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I Lena turned to look at Hills: "You too?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, everything I have today is given by my master, I can always My Lord gave everything out of his own." Hills sounds loud and mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Vanas looked enviously at Hills and said: "I am envious, I want to call out my faith so solemnly and solemnly!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge did not stop here, and then found the body that was previously scorched by Elena, and endured the intense burnt smell to purify the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the purification of the five souls, Su Ge suddenly felt that his sensation suddenly increased a lot, and the increase was almost 30%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Accumulate to a certain soul, these pure powers of thought can improve my psionic power limit and quality." Su Ge feels very comfortable at this time, God Refreshing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After processing the five souls, six people are ready to open a temporary meeting. The location was directly selected in Conner's ward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sitting down, Mile first said: "The brainless worm has no ability to move, and the speed of crawling is even slower than that of snails. Since they can appear here , indicating that other people or other things carry them in and put them on them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug immediately said: "It's a human face rat." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irina’s face is dignified: “With the light body and speed of the human face rat, this thing is unconsciously placed on the human body. It’s not difficult.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill looks to Su Ge: “What are the clues about the soul.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge shook his head: "These people are on duty, feeling a little annoyed at around two in the middle of the night, and suddenly go crazy in the morning. There are no other valuable clues."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia said with a look of disappointment: "This is a despicable guy. It’s really annoying. I really want to use my woven fire sword. Cut it to ashes "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;". You shut up, "Hills tugged Virginia Antonia prevent road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Vegginia is not the kind of person who is blaming the atmosphere, the tone and quirky name will always distort the heavily suppressed atmosphere. Get up, don't be uncomfortable, let people twist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill said: "This matter must be disposed of as soon as possible, otherwise we will be sleepy for the rest of the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone has any ideas and methods to say it." Mill and his identity are incompatible, and it is very democratic and enlightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people listened to the brow and locked in, and fell into deep meditation, and could not find any suitable ideas for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas thought after no fruit, and turned his head to look at Su Ge’s look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge smiled calmly and gestured, indicating that she was calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this smile, Vanas’s heart was immediately at ease and happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Pope is with him, there is a feeling that the father is still alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill Seeing that everyone did not speak, I asked Su Ge: "Did you not say that there is a way yesterday? How?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said with a smile:" I have already notified him last night, and it is estimated that it will arrive in a short time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, and suddenly there was a crisp ringtone under the mil's robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill took out a small silver bell that was making his own voice from his arms, and looked at Su Ge with a sullen look: "Is this yours?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said a word: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, the door of the ward sounded a polite knock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill turned his head and stared at the door, and the whole body gradually emerged with a sense of oppression: "You have to make sure that this kind of thing is not a joke." ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge leaned on the back of the chair and lifted his legs: "Reassured, I won't make fun of my life."<br />< Bryan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina was shocked at this moment, and asked in confusion: "Master, what is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She couldn't imagine what it would be like a senior Hunter Master to be so nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You feel it yourself!" Mill did not answer directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas is very calm at this time, her belief in Su Ge has reached a blind level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slim and sexy body sitting on the chair, red lips slightly said: "Maria, go to open the door."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maria didn't feel much, turned and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill sat down at this moment to calm down and look indifferent. After all, it is an old fritter in his 100s, and his psychological quality is still very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, the door is opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary's unexpected question: "Hello, sir, may I ask..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The gentleness and elegance outside the door, the mature magnetic male voice: "Hello, madam. I am the follower of Mr. Sog Sotos, come here by Mr. Zhao’s order."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary did not let go, turned and looked at her queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas is also very curious at this time, nodded slightly to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Mary smiled and said, "Sir, please!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the door open Everyone saw a young man with a handsome temperature coming in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man also looks like he is about 35 years old, his skin is fair, his dark hair is neatly combed, his chin is smooth and he has no beard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a black dress with a straight body and a neat and delicate bow tie at the neckline. The lower body is decent black trousers and shiny leather shoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is slender and well-proportioned, and his elegant body is full of great aristocratic temperament. The overall look is a sexy male guy who can make countless lonely young women fall for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering, the young man kneels down on one knee, his hands dancing a few times on his chest, his forehead is slightly underneath, with a very retro and standard Guinness ancient nobles Rite ceremony: "Randall Montgomery, see the beautiful flower of the Northland, the pearl of Guinness, the noble and elegant Queen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing such etiquette Vanas jumped in her heart: "Is this guy a great aristocrat of Guinness? I don't have any impression at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
