			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall and others did not fight to kill too many people. In Su Ge’s plan, they can even kill, just keep enough Mysterious and powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So making such a big battle, the hillside mourns the wild, but everyone finds that no one has died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold wind doesn’t know when it’s gone, the four powerful guys wearing black trench coats in the silent voice have taken Vegniya’s gesture calmly and elegantly. Go out of the encirclement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like the clerics around the encirclement, the sacred swordsmen’s warriors are all in general, and they are not qualified to see them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stay! You are these arrogant heresy." At this time, Sapir simply handled the broken arm and screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, his self-esteem has been severely trampled, and endless anger has made him unable to tolerate this group of guys to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark star clenched his fist and stepped forward: "You really thought that after the glory of the goddess, you just left!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall turned his head slightly, and the corner of his eye looked at Sapir and others faintly said: "The glory of the goddess? 哼哼..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Randall stopped and turned to read: "Don't use our narrow, ignorant vision of the church in March to measure our norms. Our late church is different from your church. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You churches have the reputation of the gods to fool the world, pseudonym, love, and madness, how many dirty things you have done over the years, yourself More than anyone else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are selfish, only to exclude dissidents, to consolidate your dominance, to be cruel to the same kind, to worship the aliens Your thinking has been bound by your narrow knowledge, not knowing how stupid you are, and I thought it was stupid to think of myself as a high-ranking person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say!?" Several bishops heard this suddenly black face like coke general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they didn't rush to do it. They said that they didn't want to be the first to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall’s voice was very loud, and the clerics around him and the mysterious people in the distance heard these words clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This suddenly made a lot of clerics look ugly, so that the mysterious people's faces sparkle with wonderful, while the heart has an instinctive identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Randall said, in the eyes of these underlying mysteries, the March church is such a presence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall slowly raised his hands and said in a loud voice: "Our evening church is very different from you. We accept all people with lofty ideals and shelter from you." The poor man, finishing the evil things for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ideals of our church are not as fame and fortune as you are, even for certain interests. Carrying out genocide, these things are too naive and too superficial. Our eyes are more long-term. The real enemy of this world is not human beings, but the ancient evil spirits, the dominators of the Yi people, the abyss, the ones in the astrology. The horror of the name. The purpose of the church in the late hours is to save people from this despair."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the clerics and mysters around me jumped in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such an ideology, such an idea can indeed be called grand, called great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Randall looked down at the bishops and all the clergy: "So we are giving you a life today, so now we have enough patience Tell you this, you are not dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the mysterious people took the lead and then hurriedly looked around and found out as blue Said by Del. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These clergymen were very embarrassed and pale, but none of them died or even suffered serious serious injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests around him looked at each other with a full surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a horrible battle. According to their ideas, these people are at least half dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, people find their comrades-in-arms, their companions are still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a bit languid, it is still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces of several bishops are a bit bad, because Randall is now morally suppressing them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall continued: "We don't have time to fight with you, no interest in fighting for power with you. We will not aim our swords and spears at ourselves." Those innocent compatriots. We have even greater goals. Because the real enemy is not our compatriots, but others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Don't think that these fake things can fool the public!" The dark star screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall’s face with a hint of indifference: “Cheat the public? Do you really think that we will, like you, promise only false things to the people? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop, Randall said faintly: "Or, have you forgotten? A year ago, who stopped Bain City?" Destruction? Who killed the black goats of Mori and calmed down the entire incident, saving the residents of the entire city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark star is very ugly after listening to the face When Emilia was reported, this was the focus at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mentions the organization of this late church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they didn’t care at the time, they all gathered their eyes on the dark son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sen's Black Goat!?" Hearing this, some people who knew a little about the situation suddenly gave a burst of exclamation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of existence is there, the person who knows only needs to think about it a little, the body can not help but tremble, just like what is the most terrible existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall continued to be indifferent and said: "How many people died that time, who summoned it, your holy blood church is very clear. We have I have wiped your ass for a while, now you dare to provoke us publicly? Do you really use our church as a charity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Randall snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the dark star body instantly turns into a darkness and disappears in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his feet, a huge wolf mouth suddenly appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a ghost wolf that exudes ghosts and ghosts. The body is very large, and only half of the body is two meters high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge mouth can easily bite a person's body in half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark star that appeared again in the distance was pale and slightly breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first escape skill is the way he presses the bottom of the box, which consumes 60% of the psionic power each time it is used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost wolf gradually dissipated with the light of a ghost, and Randall slowly turned and said: "This is just a warning."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Randall stood alone and led four people to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clergy who stood in front of them were pale at this time, and even confused in both eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the words that Randall just said did indeed make their faith, their worldview was hit hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! Right!" Two steps, Randall stopped and turned to look at Joel: "Just the war apostle said, you are today "You must die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joer’s face was gloomy and he was holding his brilliance: “Vampire! Don’t deceive too much!”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has now recognized that Randall and Gerlos are the two terrorist powerhouses he encountered with him a few days ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a believer of my Lord, it is our duty to give all the filthy to purify. Bishop Joel Mick, you have borrowed glory for many years. How many women have been persecuted in the name of the goddess, do we need to read them out one by one?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People, nobles, prisoners, slaves, female warlocks... don't you feel it? Those hundreds of souls who have been persecuted by women are calling you back to hell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;哗!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the clerics and mysters around me suddenly became unconscious, and all eyes fell on Joel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just said that Vegnia has said this, but in her capacity, everyone will subjectively doubt, but no one will spear on her words. Align to Bishop Joel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this higher vampire can be different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a detached status, a terrifying strength, a lofty ideal, and a broad mind. He didn't even kill a clergyman whose goal was to purify the world and repel those ancient evil spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the reaction of the Dark Star and the Church of the Holy Blood, they learned that the Church of the Late Bells had already been shot, and in the absence of control by the Church of the Holy Blood, Help them fight off the horrible monster from the stars and save the city of Bain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such an organization, such a code of conduct, it is really difficult for these clergy and mysterious people to have doubts and too much resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they think that Randall doesn’t make the trouble of deliberately finding a bishop, and it’s still in this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone heard Randall’s confident words and saw Joel’s sullen face, he finally confirmed that Vegginia said All are true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followers around Joel bowed their heads at this time, without any indication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are very aware of Joel’s true nature and those crimes. Nowadays, in the face of Randall’s terrorist pressure, they don’t even have the courage to raise their heads and defend their own masters. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you organize your speech so bloody?" Joel was still very hard at the moment, and he knew that he could never admit it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A thick bell rang, Randall took a deep breath, and the tone was high and said slowly: "Have you heard the bell? It is proclaiming Your death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ample pave the way is over, Randall no longer needs to come up with any other evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, his body instantly turned into a black mist, rushing towards it at a very fast speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joer sees the moment and the light shines past without any effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel said: "When you left the church in March, let these clowns tarnish the dignity of the goddess in front of you!?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this, Sapir’s face was gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that Joel is angering them, but they are really angry now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark star immediately ordered: "The Holy Sword! Attack! Grab the female priest!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Next, he handed out a black quirky dagger: "For the March goddess!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; said to meet Randall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helas and Sapir have already smashed their stomachs, and at this time they don’t want to take out the secret treasure directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only three people who can fight, and they have a total of four bishops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if there is a certain gap in combat effectiveness, they are dominant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their calculations, they don’t need to beat these three people, just drag them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because other priests will soon be able to seize the female priest who has no fighting power, so they have the capital to negotiate and swear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle begins instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; represents the March Church and the Church Alliance, which ruled the old world, against the church that never heard of the name, suddenly mysterious, powerful night bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore and Bells, who have been standing on the side, have no intention of shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the origins of this late church are unclear and the purpose is open to question, they are essentially alienated from the March church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is very embarrassed at this time, has been hiding in the crowd of the church, a look of "I am just an expert, this kind of battle I can do nothing" expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clerics who are preparing to attack are somewhat stunned and contradictory at this time. They think this is a glorious church and should not be pulled into the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what these people just said doesn’t seem to be lying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, doubts are doubtful, their firm beliefs have not wavered, so it is very fierce to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystery on the hillside was a little excited and happy at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are happy to see an organization that can challenge the authority of the March church to break the pattern and dominance that has been going on for thousands of years. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the top of the mountain, the ancient city of Ayutthaya has a tall, glamorous and seductive figure sitting there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black long skirts and dark hair sway with the wind, a pair of ice-clear jade feet shaking under the skirt, let people see the heart and evil thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is like a collection of desires of all the people in the world. She is so beautiful and attractive that no one will pay any respect and appreciation. Some are just frenzied, awkward, lustful, yin秽, the original animal nature of madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark eyes of the mask stared at the mountain, the white ears of the black hair shook slightly, and the mask made a slightly unpleasant sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Destroy my plan, I haven't found you yet. Do you still dare to let your people preach this and make my name shame?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A moment of silence, she continued: "Forget it, who makes you the heart of the world, you bastard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, she turned her head To the palace on the mountain in the distance: "Since you owe me, don't blame me for using some unconventional means, Su Ge... Sotos!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Auntie! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shu Ge under the mountain suddenly sneezed and touched his nose, and the clerics around him stood helplessly: "Look, I am today." The state is really bad. Going up is to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge secretly thanked those who had just recited themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four bishops are not the bishops of the Great Church, and the overall combat power is very strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel and Sapir teamed up, one with light, one with thunder, actually briefly and Randall remained flat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, both Light and Ray are weak for Randall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Dark Star, the same shadow hunter as Laurie, the attack method is somewhat similar to the Assassin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was almost a serious injury to the frost, but it was blocked by the sound wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has a variety of means for this assassin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the last Horace, it is harder. He is a hypnotist. It is supposed to be the most difficult and horrible. It is possible to immerse the enemy in illusion or even commit suicide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the frost is completely no matter how much, the starting hand is the cold wind and the sharp borneol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Horace trembled by the hurricane without waiting for the opening, only to support the psionic shield into the defensive state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people want to exchange opponents. However, where are the tacit understandings of these two old slickers? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of just moving, was instantly discovered by two people. The next second cold wind and shock waves suddenly increased, separating the two people directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystery outside looked at the three masters who rubbed the bishops of the four church unions on the ground, filled with shock and awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The evening bell church, afraid that it will be widely circulated in the mysterious world from today." Many people sighed inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheridan hiding in the crowd clenched his fists: "The evening bell church... damn, they can actually accept the witch. But since you are looking for death, I am not Mind to help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of ​​taking advantage of the benefits of the fisherman appears in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the seven masters became a group, the priests around him, led by the demon hunter, a large number of people of the sacred sword team quickly rushed to Jenny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia picked up his long sword and said: "What do you do? Soothe the injured?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny looked at her and faintly responded: "Now please call me the Queen of Pain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Queen of pain? Hey? This name is good. "Vigny's eyes lit up and suddenly found that Jenny's name was actually a little higher than herself. Such a good name she did not expect!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the clergy who rushed around, Jenny could gradually gather in her throat and calmly asked: "Do you know? There are some subsonic waves that can pass directly through the ears. Acting on the human brain, the coordination of the nerves creates serious confusion, which can cause fifteen minutes of general paralysis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia A glimpse, honestly shook his head: "I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny looked at her and felt like she was playing the piano. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they want to catch them, these people did not use long-range weapons to prepare for melee uniforms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third and third floors, the Demon Hunter and the Holy Swordsman took out the lasso in their hands, and around the hundred and ten people surrounded the two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just when they are ready to throw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, they found themselves very uncomfortable, stiff, and whispering in their ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fierce nausea came in, and the body was unable to lay down the weapon and kneel on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toughly turned around and looked around, they were surprised to find a large number of purple-black tubes on their faces, like poisoning, all stiff. You can’t move on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, the priests who had just had a hundred imposing enthusiasm, instantly disappeared, like a student who admits mistakes, honestly lying on the ground, bowing his head and not moving . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!?" In the face of this sudden change, the remaining clergy around him were completely scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, many mysterious people on the hillside have risen a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this ability is too strange, it’s too horrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to those people? What means does the black man use? What is the principle, they can't understand at all, I don't understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia took his hands off his ears and looked shocked at the surroundings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny is graceful and calm, stepping on the steadily stepping on those The body of the church staff walked out of the encirclement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the situation! What's the situation!?" Sapir, who was being rubbed by Randall, saw that the spirit was collapsing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A feeling of powerlessness, a sense of despair suddenly spread from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When is the priest still possessing such a horrible and weird means! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devil! Demon! I killed you!" At this time, a member of the Holy Sword team was a little mad, with a big mouth in his mouth, and raised the holy sword and cut it down to Jenny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny’s body slightly evades the attack and gently touches his helmet with black gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, ah, ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scream of a screaming screaming suddenly sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests around him widened their eyes and looked at the sacred team members with horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he pulled off his helmet and could see that his big eyes were full of bloodshot eyes, his hands clasped his head, and he continued to tear, as if What is in his mind makes him feel incomparably painful and tormented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goddess is on! Is this woman really a pastor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course the pastor Haven't you seen her cure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which priest has such a strange ability? Have you heard of it? You have seen "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no silence in the silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they haven’t seen it, they haven’t heard of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in books, there is no such record. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black leather boots step on the stone, and the crisp footsteps are extra harsh and chilling against the screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward again, the four-day clerics took a step back in horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
