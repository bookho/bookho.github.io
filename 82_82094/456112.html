			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berke stares at Su Ge, pinching the dagger in his hand: "Secret career!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I still have some insights," Su Ge said casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge did not look at him, but looked down at the blood on the ground, thoughtfully, looking at the posture did not put this expert level The thief is in the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this scene, Berkton felt that he had received great humiliation: "Do you really think that the secret profession can do whatever you want!?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg seems to have figured out what he said, and he said to him, "Yes, the secret profession is what you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The voice just fell, and the invisible blade appeared again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berke is a keen inspiration after all. The momentary body that propped up the psionic shield is like a gymnast who is generally flexible and flips, and actually avoids all the sound waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One turned over and landed, when Burke’s hands were full of blood, his face shouted: “Since you are looking for death, then I will fulfill you!”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Burke still has some other means, but now the situation is special, he does not want to cause too much movement, alarming the mysterious people below, he decided to use his own cards! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his hands ripped open, Sug saw a red armor on his left arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This arm guard covers his entire arm, reddish, and a ring of metal like a claw stabbed into his arm like a blood vessel The bodies are linked together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug saw this thing suddenly felt a burst of mysterious atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now! Be a sacrifice for blood!" Burke whispered, and a lot of psionics were injected into the arm guard, followed by a forward swing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge immediately felt the invisible force on his body, making his body's blood flow slow and his body stiff, and he couldn't move in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bells came out of the heart and spread throughout the body, and Su Ge found that he could not offset this mysterious bondage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a bit of a meaning, it's a five-level secret treasure, it can resist the cutting of the late bell." Su Ge's face showed a hint of interest, completely uncontrollable panic . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Block’s face came over darkly: “Damn guy, do you know how much energy I have consumed to feed this guy!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly looked at him and replied in a calm to swearing tone: "I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "...I want to suck your blood! Let you know that I will offend my end!" Burke opened his mouth, revealing the white teeth, like a vampire who was about to suck blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly said: "If I were you, I would never beat my blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fearing who!" Burke looked close, and took out the dagger: "You don't need to calm down again. I know that you are full of fear in your heart. I have a special talent that can be The taste of fear is tasted in the human blood. The more intense the blood, the more sweet it is!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This blood sacrifice is born for me. , is my exclusive treasure!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berke’s look is getting more and more sturdy, and the bloody sacrifice on his arm actually starts to wriggle, as if he is alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knife flashed, and a thin scar appeared on the face of Su Ge’s white, and the bright red blood flowed slowly along the cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berke took back the dagger, looked at the red blood on the blade, and licked his lips: "Is it very desperate, very scared? At that time, maybe I will be more compassionate and make you die more quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge looked at him like a smile and didn't talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berke said: "I see how long you can hold, let me taste your fears!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, put out his tongue and put a drop of blood into the mouth and eat it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Su Ge couldn’t help but smile: “How is the taste?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What's going on? How can there be no fear of sweetness?" Burke's look is incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, a drop of blood descended on Su Ge’s cheek and fell on the carpet on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a burst of smoke and corrosion, the carpet was as ugly as it was corroded by strong acid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berke saw this pair of eyes tightening, not waiting to talk suddenly felt a violent burning sensation spread throughout the body, followed by the mouth, esophagus, abdomen A violent pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is stiff and difficult to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is...this is..." Burke looked up hard, and his face was filled with dark blood vessels everywhere, like a middle. Very poisonous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the stumbled Burke, Su Ge said calmly: "I said, don't hit my blood."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...I... I killed you!" At this time, Burke screamed and tried his best to lift the dagger to the throat of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next second, Burke felt a groan, and found that his entire body actually passed through the body of Su Ge and fell behind Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bottom down, the physical convulsions and convulsions made him unable to get up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint huge black wings flashed past, and Su Ge took a look at the body: "I have to say that the restraint effect of this blood sacrifice is really good, and it is necessary to use the wing to kill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berke’s eyes are already congested and can’t see anything, and the mouth of the mouth is vomiting with dark blood. “This...this is not...maybe.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body functions are constantly being destroyed, and at this time he has been very difficult to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, Su Ge looked at him and said: "There is nothing in this world that is impossible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I...not...gan..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After waiting, the body that is constantly twitching is suddenly soft and has no life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge indifferently said: "As you think, I also intend to solve the enemy with minimal movement."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After killing the gunmen, Su Ge was thinking about what to do next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When seeing the secret treasure on Burke’s arm, Su Ge has already determined this set of guidelines after a quick deduction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had intended to treat this blood sacrifice with poisonous blood, and what he did not expect was that the idiot actually ate his own blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the secret treasure on Burke’s arm has already lived. It has turned into a huge metal cymbal and swiftly rushed toward Su Ge to find the next host. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sneered, grabbed its body with his right hand, squeezed hard, and the cold flame followed: "Honely!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if this thing has any consciousness. When I feel the cold flame, it suddenly becomes stiff, like a dead bug, and dare not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger put it on the ground, the command on the top: "There is a lot of blood here, give me a drink, then put something in your stomach." Spit it out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing this, this blood sacrifice immediately became active, first on the dead Burke's body, and quickly sucked blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the blood sacrificed blood, Suge turned his head and looked at the ground, the scared face of the extremely pale Ligon: "If you don't die, you won't die." Do you know? You will die very badly next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bishop is forgiving! The bishop is forgiving! I know it is wrong! I will never dare anymore. Forgive! What are your requirements, I promise you!" Li Gen pleaded on the ground begging for mercy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg seems to feel something, saying: "It’s already late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? "Ligan's face is pale, and some of his stagnation is not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sat down at random: "Burke helped you with the ceremony, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ligan nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Burke is dead now, the ceremony is not maintained, the sacrifice is not in place, do you know what the consequences are?" Su Ge asked coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ligan’s body trembled fiercely, and he couldn’t speak with horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wrath of the gods." Su Ge continued to say coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right! Bishop! I beg you to save us! It doesn't matter if I die, I am willing to give everything to me, don't hurt my son!" Kneeling on the floor, a nose and a tear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugly looked helplessly at the ceiling, and a tentacle full of mouthwashes extended through it: "It’s late."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, Ligan still talked, but was caught in the tentacles instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giggle...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the chicken that died immediately, Ligan’s throat was fierce The screams, neck, head, and body are entangled by the tentacles, and the sharp mouthparts have already started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tragedy cannot be described. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thirty seconds, Ligan’s body disappeared, leaving only one place of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Suge said to Evan before, irritating the result of existence, unfortunately is not just about himself, but all of this blood. people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After eating the root, the bloody tentacle gradually approached Suger, and seemed to be looking around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, it bypassed Su Ge and ate Burke’s body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in the living room, when Mike was anxiously waiting, suddenly his body froze, and then the body was like being entangled in something, floating in Struggling in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood splatters, splashing around people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a very short calm, the shrill screams rang through the hall, and countless people ran out like crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore saw this, his face was gloomy: "Damn! They are actually holding a ceremony to the black-blooded twins? Are they crazy??"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sacrifice of blood!" At this time, Julie seemed to feel after seeing this tentacle, and the body swept out like a wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of the star needs forty-one points to see it, the mysterious person present can see the number of the palm, the remaining mystery and the ordinary People can only see people from several road families floating in midair at this time, and the blood and flesh are blurred in an instant, and they are swallowed up by some invisible things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I can’t see it, these mysterious people are not rookies after all. I guessed that this was the result of the failure of the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The messenger of the black blood and the twins, the sacrifice of blood is nearby!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instant, All mysterious people showed their true body in an instant, rushing upstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
