			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an hour, Su Ge looked at the contents of the frantic book roughly, his face was very bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole book can be said to be a maddening metamorphosis. It is tortured by various means, swearing people, and finally making it completely abandon the reason, and is caught in the frenzy of the enemy and the enemy. The method in the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This content is extremely bloody, dark, anti-human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at it roughly, and suddenly the whole person was not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night of the town’s soul is constantly echoing, and the mood of the recovery is flat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of this book is called spiritual pollution. People who have seen it will be infected by the madness, bloodyness and despair inside. The quality of the heart is poor, it is easy. It will be contagious and become like the people in the book, crazy, anti-human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This book is too dangerous." Su Ge squeezed the frantic book, his face dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of this book is not a fantasy novel, but a real existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who wrote the book, how to torture the body, how to torture the spirit, eliminate the belief, smash the rationality, release the animal nature and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and each method is equipped with several complete experimental records. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who were experimented were all kinds of people, there were cultists, lovers who loved each other, strong believers, unbelievers, and even powerful mysteries, and ... some heroes recorded in the history books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horror of the means, the truth of the content, so that the heart of Su Ge at that time has produced an idea of ​​eagerness to try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is still him. If it is other mystery, it is estimated that it has been infected by this crazy taboo knowledge, causing huge riots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley smiled and asked: "How? Is it very pleasant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge retracted the frantic book and sighed: "It really makes people very "Pleasure"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Giggle, I still really like the style of this book, but the things recorded are too low-level and boring." Shirley Say, stand up and stretch your body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge followed and stood up, and returned to the study with his heart in the black cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is no help from the night of the soul, it is estimated that I will be greatly affected in my heart now." Su Ge couldn't help but recall his head. Those who greatly stimulate the dark side and animal nature of human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are going to see blood wine today, right?" Transforming thoughts, Su Ge asked Shirley to change clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley nodded and said, "Where are we going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Go shopping, and then buy a few bottles after you can't." Su Ge also got up to change clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;叮铃铃......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorbell suddenly rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" asked Shirley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled down the stairs: "Our bloody wine has fallen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open The door can be seen standing outside the door with four men dressed in neat black dresses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And take the lead, the official Su Ge knows on board, Duke Haussmann who can get into Shirley's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the ship for two days, Duke seems to have completely separated from that terrible nightmare, full of energy, with eyes and red light . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank God, I finally found you." After seeing Su Ge, Duke said with a gratitude, stepping on his arms and holding Su Ge, It seems that I saw a good friend who has not met for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge greeted Duke with a warm smile and asked: "What is the situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged butler of the side said with a respectful smile: "My home Since returning home, the young master has been hoping to see you again to show your kindness to my young master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sees this middle-aged person Hey, because this middle-aged man is actually on the boat, crazy Stephen Steward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man said with respect and gratitude at this time: "On the boat, thank you for your treatment. Without you, I am already dead on the ship. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled lightly: "Fair trade, your young master paid the money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point Duke loosened Su Ge and sighed: "If there are not two clergymen who are dead, I estimate that it will take another two days to find you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su The grid said sideways: "Come on, my cousin is not at home, I am the owner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four did not come in all, Duke and Steven followed Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sitting down, Su Ge smiled and said: "I will not prepare any tea, I guess the two will not stay too long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke said with a smile: "It’s not Mr. Black Mist, I feel so keen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After laughing, Duke said in a positive manner: "This time, the first thing I want to do is to express my gratitude to you, and to finish the transaction we have not done before."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfinished transactions are naturally the rewards that Duke should pay to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Su Ge is not very interested in this thing, continue to say: "There seems to be a second and third."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke then said seriously: "The second thing is to get help from Mr. Black Mist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Oh? What kind of help?" Su Ge asked in a chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke said with a dignified face: "My uncle seems to be cursed. He has changed from last night to the whole person. Trembling, yelling in his mouth, saying that there is something horrible to eat him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s usual way of asking: "You can find it." The church helped."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stephen Butler on the side explained: "Because of business problems, our family is unbelievers, and the relationship with the church is not very good. At the same time we The family is the representative of many unbelievers. If you choose to ask for help from the church, it will have too much influence on the face of the Hausmann family, and it will affect the trust of our partners."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Su Ge knows, then said: "This problem is not big, as long as the price is right, I can help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du After listening to it, I was very happy. Then I said with a relaxed tone: "The third thing is a good thing, our family is the most Prepare an antique auction and prepare some antiques for a long time. But after experiencing the statue, the family is a little scared of a few antiques, so I would like to ask you to identify it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this good thing?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke said with a smile: "I know that you love ancient books. There is a book that you can't read in this antique, although this book can't directly give you But if you are interested, you can lend it to you for a few days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!?" Hearing this, Sugton’s eyes lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After five days, the special collection of antiques has not yet "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I picked up the errand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge quickly said When I finished, I turned to smile and asked: "So now we can talk about our last transaction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke heard a refreshing smile:" I like straightforward people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
