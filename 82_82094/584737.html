What a terror law?" Su Ge asked with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock organized the language and asked: "Do you know the secret profession?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Geen nodded a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock said: "This cult is not only a mystery, but also has a secret profession."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sighed: "After?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock saw this moment suddenly: "You are not surprised at all." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I received the information, the mysterious person under his command, after hearing the secret profession, was shocked and even faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every secretive profession has a very horrible ability, which is deeply embedded in the knowledge of Macock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cult who has a secret profession is itself a bomb that can explode at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time the young man is so understated as if it were a very common thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the accident in the depths of Macock’s eyes and secretly snorted: “Is it really rare to be a secret profession? I seem to see a lot.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three archbishops, the holy godfather, the bishop of the cold-blooded church, the dark star, and the three bishops of the Holy Grail, are all secret professions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock returned to God and said in his language: "According to the intelligence, this cult is very dangerous because he has very dangerous abilities and Occupation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you still know his career?" Su Ge asked unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret profession that is known to others is not that great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock nodded: "We know through some special channels that this cultist's occupation is called the accused, it is a spiritual influence, Let others fall into a frenzied, crazy career."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Macock’s face was extremely dignified and said with a heavy tone: “He just waved his hand in rumors. It can make people fall into madness. In a few words, dozens of people can get caught up in each other's killings. Even a song can make hundreds of people fall into a nightmare and die in a dream."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge’s mouth opened involuntarily, revealing a strange smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite of Macock saw that the face suddenly became very exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can you still laugh out! How horrible this is! After we heard these abilities, we are still scared by the fear of us. !" Macock yelled in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile on Su Ge seems to be bigger, as if the child saw a fun toy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock felt very embarrassed, coughing, and tempted: "Mr. Assassin, that... I know you are very strong, but This accused person is really very powerful, please... please don't take it lightly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge then returned to God, astringent smile coughed: "Sorry, it’s a bit of a damaging atmosphere to show this smile now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Is talking about the atmosphere!?" Macock’s mentality collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lived for fifty-two years and experienced several life-and-death battles, only to find that he could not keep up with the rhythm of this young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at Macock’s madness, pressed his heart down, and tried to show his face a serious, The dignified expression said: "Sorry, I just thought of some interesting things. As you said, the ability of this accused person is terrible, especially the ability to let hundreds of people fall into a dream. Natural enemies..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to dreams, Su Ge’s mouth is involuntarily revealing a weird smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock’s eyes are desperate, he doesn’t understand it now, this one is really professional, or it’s a fake that looks like it’s loaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his cognition, no mysterious person will despise this horrible ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any wave of hands can make people crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few words can make people hate each other, riots and fights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be said to be the most headache for mysterious people, especially those who maintain order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to stop, not caught, especially on this large number of ships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an isolated environment, once a battle occurs, it will quickly cause horrific riots and even massacres. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law is not blaming, mad, crime is contagious, and the infection is very fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He should be rarely on board, and it is not clear about the seriousness of this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macock thought about it and decided to give Sug a good analysis of the relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Assassin, please don't underestimate this ability." Macock said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug hurriedly shook his head: "How can I despise it! This ability to disturb the spirit is terrible."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s said in the mouth, but Macock clearly feels that the smile of Suge’s mouth is getting bigger and bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him want to go up and give Sug a punch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding his knees with both hands and suppressing his impulses, Macock said incomparably: "This ability is isolated here." It is the most terrifying to wear..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since, Macock has said everything in detail and terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard the truth: "So horrible? I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mako Ke heard this easy answer, and the corner of his eye couldn't help but take it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg didn’t pay much attention to Markoc at this time, at this time his more attention was on thinking, how to tease this has only run to the dead end Self-righteous mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, what are you going to do next?" Macock tried to suppress his inner madness and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge casually said: "Wait for the next victim to appear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next time It is very likely that it is not a victim, and the ship is so big, we can't patrol all the way. If you increase the number of people, it is easy to cause some panic," Macock said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge set his hand: "You don't have to move, just wait for peace of mind, then give it to me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Give it to you? What are you going to do? If more than a dozen people have riots, you can't kill them all," Makok said anxiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the ships that are on the ship are VIPs, carrying various kinds of insurance on their bodies, and they are worth a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and once an appointment occurs, the impact on the entire company is too great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly smiled: "Of course I will not kill. I am a psychologist, I will give them psychological counseling and restore them to reason." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Macock almost spit out a blood, his eyes gradually widened, looking at Su Ge with a black question mark, his face was incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did I say unrealistically? Captain?" Sug saw that Macock was comparable to Erha’s funny expression, and his attitude was somewhat unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Markcock returned to God and asked seriously: "Are you sure you haven't said a joke? How can people who are affected by mystery use psychological counseling?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su I randomly spread my hand: "My psychological counseling is not ordinary. Don't forget, I am also a mystery. Do you still believe in General Grasse?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Macock did not answer, and he said in his heart: "I certainly believe it! If you don't believe it, you have already been bombarded by me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but After thinking about it, I found that Su Ge said it was realistic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a mysterious psychological counseling, you might be able to settle those who are crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what defenses do we need to take?" Makok asked with a little peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge touched his thoughts and said, "I don't need it for a while, I will inform you when I need it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Just wait! Can't take the initiative?" Macock asked impatiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at Macock and said faintly: "Captain, I know that you are in a hurry, but don't forget something common sense. The tracing is the clue. I don’t know what to do, how do you let me find it? Do you want me to go out and meet someone and ask: "Hey! Are you a bad accused? "This is also a bit too idiotic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock opened his mouth and found that he did not know how to refute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continued: "The purpose of the cult is obvious, that is, to make you nervous. And long-term tension is prone to nervousness. There are some unnecessary chaos and even disputes. I can conclude that even you know that the information he exists is his own initiative."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" How can I see it?” Macock hurriedly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge casually said: "You don't know mystery. The secret profession is called the secret profession because they are full of mystery. Mystery is a threat. The secret professions that are known are not mysterious, and the natural threats are greatly reduced. This is deeply taboo for every secret profession. His whereabouts have always been hidden. Why suddenly I was known after two days of sailing. What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
