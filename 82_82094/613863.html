			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Albert’s voice, Iyeta was silent for a second and retorted: “We are creating a happy world for all female warlocks.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert sneered: "You really know what you are. You should be very clear about what kind of era this is, thousands of years since ancient times." Before, how many heretics can complete the restoration? The original Brotherhood of the Yellow Emperor, the death sect, the ghost fleet, the consequences of these people are miserable, you are very familiar with the history books. You are stronger than those people. ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta completely silenced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she said in her conversation with Su Ge, she is a smart person who can recognize herself. So she can now clearly understand that there is no difference between the female warlock and those people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as the three moons in the sky still exist, as long as they are still recognized as heretics, then they do not have any possibility of turning over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert suddenly said: "Have you heard of the church in the late hour?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Upon hearing these four words, Iyeta nodded and said, "The powerful mysterious organization revealed in the Ayutthaya incident a year and a half ago. Its teachings are almost the opposite of the March church, and the brightest shelter includes the witch. All the heresy, the female warlock, shocked the whole mysterious world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alber nodded, hands in his trouser pocket and asked: "For the church of the late bell, How much do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very powerful, very mysterious. The only one in the past 100 years that has blatantly confronted the March church, but it is safe and horrible. It is rumored that there is no normal person in the whole church, and it is very concealed. So far no one has been able to find out the organizational structure and the true identity of the members."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Albert sighed and said, "Yes! There is only such a organization to dare and the March church. Plate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta tempted: "Is this Mr. Assassin and the late bell..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert did not answer: "I hope that you make a really correct decision, otherwise the existence you face will be unimaginable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Iyeta’s legs trembled and a cockroach almost fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert reached out and held her body: "Remember my advice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finish, turn and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Albert leave, Ieta’s heart is now more trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just did not deny Albert, which means that Mr. Assass may indeed have a certain relationship with the church in the late bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The evening bell church..." She squeezed the fence with her hands, and some old skin had prominent bones. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After learning about the night bell church sheltering witches and female warlocks, they conducted an in-depth investigation of the organization and even used many precious resources, hoping to Get some messages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, to their disappointment, the reputation of the church in the late night is very loud, but there is no clue in the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They found through investigation that the church in the late bells seems to have a good relationship with the Elvis and the Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they used the relationship to investigate, they found that all the messages of the church in the late bell were blocked, except for those core personnel, others did not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Iyerta’s trembling body gradually calms down, and things seem to come here, there seems to be no other choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collect your expressions and mindsets, press everything in your heart and become the mature middle-aged lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision has been completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherry's comfortable bubble in the bath asked: "Are you sure that the female warlock will not make low-level mistakes in those single-celled creatures?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug I was wiping my rifle with a rag and said casually: "She is a smart person. At the same time, I believe in Albert's work. All of their hopes are on me. All my requirements are responsive. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley sighed and continued to take a bath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I first went into the dream to deal with something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ugly octopus? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, after all, possessing divinity, and it also imprisons Drake's soul, heroes can't die here."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Su Ge closed his eyes and entered the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the Kingdom of God, there was a burst of baby screams from time to time in the depths of the misty jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this voice, the people of the Kingdom of God have become accustomed to it, their souls have been baptized and sheltered by the power of the gods for a long time, far beyond normal humans. s level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge opened his eyes and stood up from the throne, and jumped up to the top of the temple, next to the dark clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing at the top of the whole country, Su Ge looks around and can see patrolling knights, busy believers, wandering ghost wolves, and two Ice blue battleship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battleship was created by Shure through the power of faith, Su Ge’s power and tribute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one that appeared in the dream before was one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking around, Su Ge’s body took off directly, and the next second came to the depths of the deep forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time in an open space in the jungle, six knights armed with weapons stood around like a statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of them holds a chain full of spikes, and in the center of the chain is the god of dry and deformed bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, this ugly god is still struggling desperately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with his constant struggle, the spikes pierced into his body, injecting a horrible cold, destroying his power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seeing my Lord." Seeing Su Ge descend from the sky, the six knights bowed down and respectfully said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded slightly and turned to look at the continually struggling Son of God, said coldly: "This ugly thing is really smearing the gods."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Son of God saw Su Ge, there was no fear, but more madness and frenzy, and struggling more intensely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is not surprised by this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mind of God is very different from human beings. God does not understand fear, only knows to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods and people are not the same kind of existence, and the gods have no negative state of human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing such a crazy god, Su Ge’s eyes are slightly sullen, and his cold eyes are gradually rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, the thunder of thunder rang out over the entire country of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The busy people in the kingdom of God looked up in the sky with awe, but did not kneel on the ground to pray and continue their work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the thunder, Vanas’s lonely and loud voice came out in the vast palace: “My Lord has just appeared in the world, capturing a destructive human The evil spirits. The intention is that in the storm-class ocean-going tanker, thousands of people on the Sardinian engulfing ship descended on the earth, and were discovered by the bell people, bringing my gods to the world and saving the sentient beings. Don't be afraid, fear and glory will go on!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, all the people in the whole country of God are very excited and happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
