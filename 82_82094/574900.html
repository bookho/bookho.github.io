			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the command was commanded, Su Ge looked down at Vanas under the throne: "You performed very well, Vanas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your grace." Vanas squatted down and looked devout and fanatical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a year and a half, as a pope, Vanas’s performance is perfect, even though Su Ge thinks a lot of decisions with mysterious thinking. There are no flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church of the late bell has now penetrated deeply into the kingdom of Guinness, and under the perfect operation of Vanas, all the elites of the entire capital They are all faithful fanatics of the Church of the Late Bells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side, Vanas, who is the Empress, is constantly in the process of docking with the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Su Ge’s accident, the entire Guinness Kingdom entered an autonomous phase. It is nominally the jurisdiction of the Church of the Holy Blood, but it is fully autonomous internally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Blood Church only sent a bishop without any real power to monitor the general situation here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come here." Su Ge then ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas was so excited when he heard it, then he endured the accelerating beating of his heart, carefully stepping on the steps full of divine steps toward the throne of Su Ge. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, she is the only one who is qualified to step onto the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty-three seconds later, she came to the throne in front of the throne with great precision, and bowed respectfully on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stretched out the palm of his hand with silver-gray armor and placed it on her shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black scent of death enters her body along the palm of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, the death scent in Vanas’s body felt a fierce threat, only to see her long hair drifting, and there was a very vague behind her. Twisting the figure, it seems to be struggling, it seems to be embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Su Ge snorted, and the horrible gods broke out and shattered the distorted figure directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a thrilling death that instantly subsides, from a struggling beast to a meek puppy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, in a year, you are qualified to stand on the side of my throne." Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas rushed back to God to express his admiration and gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About a year ago, at the first glimpse, the great Lord discovered her physical problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her body is integrated with the knowledge of the Great God of Death, and the process of integration is not her self-strength, but gradually becomes the container of the resurrection of the Great God of Death. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the integration ends, she will not be her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time she felt great regret and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as she felt that the sky would fall, her heaven, her Lord gave her hope and redemption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the first time she took the throne under the command of the Lord, and it was like a terrifying snow-like horror, let her almost have a few legs. Soft fall down on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, when she was in front of the throne, she experienced countless life and death tests and reached the peak of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the first time the great Lord gave his gift directly, the kind of happiness, safety and comfort that seemed like a drop of water into the ocean, so she still remembers it. New, never forgetting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great Lord completely shattered the remaining consciousness of the Great God of Death, transforming his knowledge into his own power, and reintegrating it by injecting divine power into her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of the knowledge owner, this fusion is very fast and smooth, the feeling of being comfortable is like flying, let her once again fully witness The horror power of the great master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the Lord of Greatness gave her the gift for the fifth time, as a gift of her merits and piety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, Vanas revered and got up, stepped back down the steps, and finally squatted on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge uttered: "Retire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas said respectfully, exiting the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the departure of Vanas, Su Ge is more satisfied: "Now she has more than 50% integration with the god of death, the overall strength has come At the peak of the lord's level, the form has completely separated from the human form and entered a higher form between energy and matter. This kind of posture, this kind of power, is the most suitable for the Pope of the Church of the Late Bell. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today's Vanas is the second strongest of the entire church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is naturally the priest of Water, who has become the dominator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is to enter the lord of the lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Su Ge, it should be ranked sixth, because he also has Randall and Adeline who also entered the lord level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down at the broken consciousness of the dead god on the palm: "It seems that all the great gods are craving for their own children, the purpose is to regain the flesh and regain the intellectuality." Sure enough, the Great God is not the end of humanity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas looked awe at the dark door that had been locked, turned and walked down the corridor for about fifty meters, standing on a completely composed of frost and cheekbones. The table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After standing up, the platform of the elevator is slowly falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on the top, she is still remembering the feeling she just had. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of being overwhelmed by the power of the great master is as happy, safe and happy as she is held in her arms by the great master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, her face of eternal ice appeared as a fascinating and ridiculous girl like a spring girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The escalator has stopped when you return to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is standing on the first floor of the temple: worshipping the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place is empty, solemn, solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are numerous reliefs of the great Lord and the great deeds of the past on the dark golden walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not much in the ceremony, only the twelve pillars on both sides are supported. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a tall silver-gray statue in the forefront, which is the embodiment of the great Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the wall on both sides of the ceremony, there are a lot of solemn statues wearing armor and holding weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their lower body is in the wall, the upper body leans forward to poke out the wall, the golden eyes look at everything on the ground, full of horrible oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sacred place where the top leaders of the late bells worship the great Lord every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the whole church, there is only one person who can pass freely here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time I think about it, she feels that she is filled with body and soul by happiness and glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, more fanaticism and worship for the Lord of Greatness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, He is her day, her land, her world, her everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a rest on your inner happiness and happiness, and the expression on your face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serious and cold, solemn and honorable glamorous female pope appeared, and walked out of the pilgrimage hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside of the main hall is a long step, and under the steps is a square paved with extremely neat ice blue floor tiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The square is wide, and there are four avenues leading to the outer apocalypse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrain here is very high, standing under the temple, above the steps, you can overlook all the buildings of the whole country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the cultivation of Shure, the buildings and temples of the entire Kingdom of God are the absolute center, extending to the four parts of the Apocalypse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four parts of the Apocalypse extend out of the Eighth House of the Storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall structure shows the form of the four elephants and the gossip in the yin and yang under the inspiration of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two sides of each other, symmetrical, perfectly satisfying the visual effect of Suger obsessive-compulsive disorder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a neat blue avenue between each hospital and the department. There are four apostolic statues in the middle, eight great storm symbols, and twelve foggy knights. Going up like a circular board, it is like a very complicated array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenery outside the large building complex has also changed completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of plants appeared on the darkened land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These plants are mainly divided into two types, which are similar to willow and eucalyptus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves of the willow tree are deep blue, and look crystal clear, like a group of wildfires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves of the eucalyptus show a crystal white, like a myriad of frosted flowers, very beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trees are beautifully arranged by the careful arrangement of the Shur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of blue tombstones in the middle of the trees. These tombstones are the ones who fall into the sleeping soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also awakened souls lingering in this beautiful woods, enjoying redemption and peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time there are a large number of ghost wolves in the woods, and the giant ghost wolves are accompanied by those souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are accompanied by fog, or squatting back and forth, or squatting on the ground, waiting for the call of their masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas stepped down the steps, and the storm knight guards waiting outside immediately followed, keeping the pope in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group walked out of the city by following the direct link to the temple and the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Luwanas has to go every day, while looking at the situation of the building, and in addition to determine the progress of the expansion of the Kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the building, there are flashes of light from time to time, that is a devout believer entering the Kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now every believer gets a late night stamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this mark they are free to enter the Kingdom of God, but appear in the wilderness outside the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All matters concerning the Church of the Night Clock are handled in this Kingdom of God, which guarantees that no clues or traces will be left in the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bennis!" Just halfway through, on the side of the branch, I saw Bernice, who had just returned to the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope." Bernice made a slight salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas nodded: "The Lord of Greatness has lowered the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benny After listening to the eyes, my eyes lit up and I was very excited. "Even if it is a broken bone, it will surely resound the god of our Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas Satisfied with the face, said: "There are three female warlocks in the emperor who are in trouble. They should be related to the recent changes in the women's soror's soror. Three of them will go to you tomorrow. You are responsible for solving their problems and absorbing them. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Bernice was so excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can find the help of Archbishop Adeline, or you can use your resources. But the premise is to ensure your safety, and to properly promote us Church of the late bells. You are all children of my Lord, and my Lord does not want you to have an accident."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
