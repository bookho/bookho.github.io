He can confuse the monsters with the bell. He can break the rock through the bell. He can hide himself by voice. body of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he returned to God, he found himself out of humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early years, the strong body was left with only the dusty bones. He didn't know how long he had been sitting here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should there be a hundred years, or a thousand years? Men think of themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he doesn't care about this, because he is now standing on a new level, he has left the shackles of humanity and came to a new attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here, the third chapter is completed, and the fourth chapter is called: the night clock of the realm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this Su Ge pause for a moment and sort out the massive messages he just saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire third chapter can be said to be the most informative, because there is a huge space to introduce the man to comprehend the bell, the skills and methods of integrating the bell.

The bell of the late bell came out again. The man’s gimmick without eyes saw the truth that he had never seen before. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the night clock is not produced by oneself, but the sound that comes out whenever a soul strikes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is at a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eager to liberate and the redemptive soul gained salvation and liberation by striking the big clock and entered a new level of peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bells of this impact are naturally filled with salvation and purification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell with this principle naturally purifies all the filth in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you are a filthy soul, bathing in this bell can be freed and redeemed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! I finally understood the meaning of this bell, which is the redemptive sound of purifying all the filthy souls in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a pure and sacred existence through death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man completely figured it out at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he jumped down the temple and immediately removed the black robe that was not weathered in the valley, and smashed the skull of the unknown horn monster as a mask. , pick up the dilapidated sword that is full of rust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked out of the valley, a mysterious swordsman wearing a skull mask, a black robe, and a giant sword appeared in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a long and heavy bell in the valley again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man looked up at the setting sun, the bloody red sun completely reddened everything in the world, as if to declare something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man picked up the big sword and squatted on the ground, offering all of his highest faith to the big clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will follow your guidelines and hold your power to free all the filthy souls of the world. I am the agent of this night, the executor of death, and the purifier of the purification world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this announcement, I am the only night-time prisoner in this world, carrying the sound of the late bell, pursuing the destiny, purifying all the filthy people, Sinful people give sanctions, give relief to all hated people, and redeem those who repent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen! This night's voice will be the gospel of your last redemption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wu is the agent of the destiny, the purifier of death, my name%¥#......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The name can't be seen, but it does not affect Su Ge's understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the fictional big clock in Su Ge’s mind is like an inexplicable attraction, suddenly and suddenly a loud and magnificent bell sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, Su Ge felt an indescribable, mysterious and mysterious power on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he obviously feels that his spirit has been strengthened, and countless mysteries are attached to his own spirit, gradually changing his spiritual form and letting his spirit Form a strange form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God, isn't this the effect of potions??"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge The big eyes suddenly became shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ability to change mental state through external forces, even physical habits and structures, is exactly the same as the occupational potion that Sug had eaten before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that the late bells, the man who condensed the laws of the voice created the profession of the late bells. I have the same The experience, after coming here, the two sides resonated in the mysterious direction, through my own psionics as the basis to form the effect of the potion, changed my mental state and physical state."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell is more clear and loud, and Su Ge clearly feels that the fictional big clock in his spirit is turned by the mysterious effect. real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This world is all possible! Some special professions can pass the knowledge and content recorded in the book!" Very excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, this is already an adventure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passed slowly, and Su Ge looked at the sky with no eyes and carefully understood his physical and mental changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When all the changes were over, Suge blinked and returned to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he felt that his body had not changed, and his habits had not changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Sug is well aware that the profession still exists. Because he felt that all his knowledge about the sound was no longer as scattered as before, and now it seems to be twisted together into a rope to form a system that is completely independent from the official. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Second occupation: the night-time prisoner..." Su Ge said slowly, and there was nothing more than happiness in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knowledge that has been incarnate as "He" in the book has created new rules and boundaries, and a new profession with bells as the main body has been formed here. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Occupation really is like the master of Jeros, it is to help us to concentrate on the existence of the spirit. The night can only use the bell to cast mystery, become this After a career, I can only know the mystery of the bell "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
