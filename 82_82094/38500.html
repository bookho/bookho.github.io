			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughter and work, the day passes quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 5:30 in the evening, just as Su Ge was ready to clean up and go home, the door ran in a panic and was a big and a small division. Health. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Police! Police! Dead! Dead man!" The leading blond female teacher said in a panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack, who had been away for a day, immediately rushed up and said, "Don’t worry, say slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The latter two breathed a sigh of relief and briefly said something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incident took place at Bain Women's High School, where Winnie went to school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deceased is a female teacher, forty-five years old, majoring in accounting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afternoon students were out of school, when the students dumped garbage, they found a broken hand in the back door garbage, and immediately notified the school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After further digging, there were other bodies found to be mutilated inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, the teacher came to report the case with the female student who discovered the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After learning about the situation, Jack quickly reported the case to Orson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ossen is still dealing with the death sects, so he handed the task to Jack and Sugg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then led by Jack, a total of eight police officers returned to the school with both teachers and students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge came to the school in a carriage, he found that the entire back door was surrounded by many students and teachers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that the students and teachers are not very good at the scene, and they are worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arriving at the scene, Jack led the police to quickly separate the students and teachers from the surrounding area and put a warning line on the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the comment of everyone, Jack and Su Ge walked in through the passage in the middle of the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When halfway through, Su Ge felt someone waving at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up and looking around, I just saw Winnie reaching out in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly, not much to say into the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenni in the crowd whispered to his close friends: "I don't see it? The one who wears the robe is my brother."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside her is a girl who is taller than her, tall and tall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl has a supple golden long hair, a beautiful face, fair and tender skin, a pair of green and blue eyes like a gemstone agate shining with brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl was very tall, slightly picking up her feet and just seeing Su Ge wearing a mask at this time, and wearing a pair of gray leather gloves to check the appearance of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really a detective!" The girl was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few days, my good friend said that his brother who studied history became a police officer and also detected the murder of the Xiangguo Park. She also Some don't believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My God! Is it really your brother? It's hard to believe." Winnie's other students heard their eyes wide open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From history to police detectives, this span is too big, and many people don’t believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, I saw a classmate’s surprised look, and Winnie’s face was flashed with a hint of pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Sug squats down and Jack checks the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a knife wound." Jack, who is experienced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he turned to ask the teacher on the side and asked: "Is there any abnormal person found? Is there any abnormal action before the deceased?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher, who looks like a 50-year-old charity, said with some confusion: "I don't know this too. Teacher Pamela and the principal asked for a day off. She should stay at home during this time. Yes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack immediately asked: “What is the reason for the leave?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wearing a gray suit in a decent shape, the 60-year-old woman, the energetic old woman walked over and said: "She said that she lost important books and needs to look for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher hurriedly introduced: "This is the principal of the school, Mrs. Pansy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mrs. Jack and Mrs. Pansy made a simple After the conversation, there was no clear clue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack turned to look at Su Ge and asked: "Is it sure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug eyes At this moment, there was a strange glory saying: "Her soul is not here, here is not the first case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not here by the vision Seeing the soul of the victim, I have not heard the voice of any soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that this person is not dead here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Jack immediately said, "Mrs. Pansy, please tell me where the deceased is now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Mrs. Pansy nodded: "Yes, but I have to wait a bit. Teacher Pamela lives alone. I don't have my own family here. I have changed my residence three times in five years. I need to take a look. The file only knows where she lives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know her place." This is what the teacher said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone’s realization was drawn to the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher raised the courage and said: "A few days ago, she said that she would conduct an experiment. I need some materials to help me buy it. I just went there. She is not far from here, just at 419 Yujin Street, Room 303."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack immediately got up and said: "The scene is now blocked, leaving three people stationed. The rest will bring the body back to Dr. Adam for inspection. I and Agent Sotos went to the deceased's house to see."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the command, Jack turned and said, "Mrs. Pansy, please let the students and teachers evacuate, it’s not too early."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Pansy nodded and turned to follow the teacher to evacuate the students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sue and Jack both flowed out of the crowd, and Jack asked, "Is there a mysterious trace?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug shakes his head and says, "No, the wound should be a conventional wound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, go home and see." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After fifteen minutes, two walks came to 419 Yujin Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a six-story apartment that was built just a few years ago. Although the structure is similar to that of Su Ge, the location, decoration, quality and area are all in abundance. do not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack skillfully took out the police officer's card and got the guard at the gate. The two walked down the stone road in front of the villa to the lobby in the middle of the apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the stairs on the left to the third floor, find room 303. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stepped on the sturdy and smooth steps, looking at the white walls around the corridor and the dark red solid wood doors that were solid and delicate, and said in the heart: "Wait later If you have money, you have to buy a decent house."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing in front of the door, Jack was just about to knock on the door, only to find that the door was not locked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finger has just been put on, and the door hinge that has been fully moisturized by the lubricant is silently opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jake took out his pistol and walked in cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are daytime, but the problem of the curtains not being opened in the house is very dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
