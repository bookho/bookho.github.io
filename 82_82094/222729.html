			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing did not cost Su Ge too long. After several people processed the water ghost, Su Ge cut off the ghost’s ear and said it was very shameless. Said that the water ghost crusade is completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people did not entangle with Su Ge too much, after handling the spoils on the water ghost, after the missionary apologized to the village chief, left here to Bain The city's urban area is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge returned to the village with the grateful welcome of the village head and the farmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The village chief asked for a relatively quiet room. Su Ge took out the black goat's hair and simply soaked a horn in the lizard's blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take out the charcoal and a large piece of white paper, and use a ruler to draw a relatively simple two-ring array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven Keynesian runes of heaven, gas, water, wood, fire, copper, and silver are engraved around the circle, and Sug puts the material in the middle. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With both hands folded on the floor, there are words in your mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the injection of psionic powers, the mysterious phenomenon gradually enveloped the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black wool, horns and lizards gradually merge and deform, forming a black-black, ugly bird with a look after one minute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ugly is ugly, but it can be used." Sug took the bird and said it beside his head: "Go to Mr. Brown (the coachman) ), tell him to come and pick me up in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Su Ge tied a Mr. Brown’s hair to the bird’s neck, followed by a wave . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ugly bird flapped its wings and flew out quickly along the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After forty minutes, Mr. Brown, carrying a cigarette bag, rushed to the entrance to the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger boarded the carriage and left with the enthusiasm of many villagers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking out, they are respectful to you from the heart." Mr. Brown snorted and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said with a smile: "There will always be good news for good things, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Haha! Goddess will bless you!" Mr. Brown said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time to return to the church is exactly one and a half in the afternoon. Sugg, who has been hungry and screaming, has prepared a hearty lunch full of nutrition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dinner, when Su Ge was ready to go to Ivan, a very inconspicuous red bird flew in through the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Three in the afternoon, Room 402, 4th Floor, 211 Kaixuan Street, Luke." After the bird made a hoarse voice, it instantly turned into a red flame. It disappeared in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the inflamed bird in the invisible, Su Ge recalled the ugly former self-destructive enchantment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People are more than people, mad!" Su Ge sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporarily let go to find Ivan, Su Ge first lie in bed and close his eyes for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of psionics consumed today, and he feels that the spirit is too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it must be said that the occupation of the late-night prisoner is the only special occupation left by him. This kind of offensive and defensive means is simply scary." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, the practical effects of the two skills of the sonic blade and the night clock far exceed the expectations of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 pm, in the high-end business apartment of Kaixuan Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger sat on the soft sofa in the living room and looked at the handsome and sexy middle-aged man opposite him. He asked unexpectedly: "How did you do it?" In the past few hours, you have changed from a savage to an elite in Financial Street!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke wipes his own short red hair, Smiling and pointing to the portrait of a middle-aged woman who still has a charm in the living room, said: "I have a very good set of things for women."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge heard a glimpse: "What about this lady?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It may be too long to stay alone, and I was stunned by my superb skills. Time, this time has not been awake." Luke said, pointing to the bedroom on the inside, looking proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s face is awkward, coughing and switching to the topic asks: “Is there something rushing to find me?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke convinced the face of the casual, directly said: "I am more honest, since you help me, I will give you a very satisfactory return. I just returned to the city At the time, I walked around and found that there was something wrong with the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong!?" Su Ge jumped in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flashing light in Luke’s eyes says: “There is a strong star smell here.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey? Stars? What is the taste of the stars?" Su Ge squinted, somewhat aggressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke said casually: "The stars I am talking about are not the stars in the night sky, but some of the things in the stars that exist with the stars." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard this Su Ge instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that exists with the stars is the group of gods who cannot enter the material world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here, some time ago, someone wanted to summon those things, but I was stopped," said Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only you? Can you stop the summoning of those rituals?" This time it was Luke's turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s smile: “There are other people who are holding rituals who are traitors of the Green Flame Brotherhood, a bishop of the Green Flame Brotherhood. With the help of this, I stopped this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Summon the original fire?" Hearing this, Luke asked directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Green Flame Brotherhood will be able to guess with that foot," Luke said freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that a remnant of the original fire? There was a very strong black man who snatched the remnant of the summoning, a burning green flame Shantou." Su Ge thought about it, or said the situation at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current situation, this Luke should be a big boost for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke is very determined to shake his head: "No, but another taste, and more strange and horrible. Some people plan more horror in this city." , a greater summoning ceremony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge’s eyes slammed and the spirit suddenly tightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I simply feel that this technique should be a three- or six-time operation, a superposition of three six-ring arrays, of course, this is Conservative estimates. From now on, the whole operation has covered the entire city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you find the key core runes?" Su Ge asked . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core of all the techniques is the rune of the base, destroying the runes, and the entire array will collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke shook his head: "Not very easy to find, the whole procedure seems to have been moving, illusory, unclear, and unclear."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What exactly do you want to do with this group of madmen?" Su Ge clenched his fist and asked him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke noticed Su Ge’s mentality and seemed to be interested in Su Ge, so he said: “I don’t care about the lives of these people, but I am very I care about the internal things of the overall law."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I am there The things in the astral are very interesting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will help you pay attention to the changes in the whole operation, but this is a big help for me, I also need You can do something for me." Luke proposed conditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
