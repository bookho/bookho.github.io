			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s right hand clenched his fist and stunned John, kicked him off and said to the fat middle-aged man in front: “I advise You'd better be honest. So far, the people trapped by my cane have not been able to survive in the struggle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged is very calm and rational At this time, after discovering these sharp edges, they are no longer struggling. They endure the pain and stand there, and a lot of sweat drops from the cheeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly turned to look at Su Ge, bite his teeth: "What do you want to do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge walked over and replied: "Fishing, do you really think that my goal is your two small fish?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End, Su The grid raised his fist and hit him on his left temple, stunned him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hands out some mysterious materials, drawing a simple circle of fat in the blood of a fat middle-aged man, putting feathers and horns into it, body posture The dark crows made the devil appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go tell Randall, let him bring people to recover the captives." Sug said in the crow's ear, the crow opened his wings and quickly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side, Bishop Hayden, who closed his eyes and raised his eyes, opened his eyes and looked at the two very incomparable members of the opposite side: "How long has it been?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten...13 minutes!" Mr. Arthur hurriedly looked at his pocket watch and replied immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heiden flashed a sullen look in his eyes and turned and walked down the carriageway: "You two are staying here, don't move."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people nod their heads like a dog, dare not violate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard’s nose of the carriage has moved: “Bloody smell!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pulling out the pistol at the waist and pushing a purple-black human finger into the gun,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along the route of the two people, he was quickly around the corner I saw a young man with a graceful attitude and a black suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little recall, he remembered that this young man was just the "ordinary person." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that I am really eye-catching." Hayden squinted and said loudly about ten meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge licked the blood on the black glove and said with a smile: "Sorry, it takes a little time to deal with the bodies of your two hands, let you personally It’s embarrassing to come over.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyden slowly squeezed the handle, while the left hand took a piece of animal liver from the waist and ate it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you say this, you are looking for it." Hayden didn't even chew, swallowed and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug with his cane slightly open his arms and said calmly: "I am a little inflated today, just want to find someone to fight with me, happened to meet you. Since you are two stupid men who want to find you, I naturally don’t need to keep my hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heiden heard this reason for not adjusting, brow Tightly asked: "Is your brain sick?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge grinned: "My mind is very healthy, my mind is very clear. You are also a dead spirit." Warlock, should be expert level? Just right, let me know what a real mysterious duel is like today. After all, my previous items are in the primary stage, and few of them use mysterious means, almost all of them are physical means. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Hayden initially defined Suge as a mentally mad fighting mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it is inevitable that the battle will be inevitable, Hayden will not say anything directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point his gun seems to have added what means, there is no sound when shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, Sug gives himself a night clock to protect him directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suggton was shocked and his body was ready to pull closer. His current advantage is melee fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hayden saw this sneer: "Stupid novice behavior!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, I took a look at it. A dead bomb that was twice as big as a fat middle-aged man, the human heart was taken out, and the wire was pulled straight out and thrown at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of Su Ge can start in an instant, and suddenly sighs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyden suddenly heard a horrible sound and made people feel the fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is awkward and almost falls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One second he suddenly recovered from the slight dizziness, and suddenly found his own vision increased by three points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, what is this means!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you haven’t thrown far away The plague bomb exploded directly between two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purple-grey smoke suddenly enveloped the five-meter square space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, a large number of tiny insect-like bugs can be seen in the purple smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s body carefully stepped back a few meters, his hands jerked forward and pushed countless sound waves to whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hayden’s inspiration suddenly felt a sting, and then he raised his hand and drew a triangle in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hula la la...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of glass broke through the air, Su Ge’s sound wave The invisible shield of Hayward and Hayden collapsible at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heiden’s body rolled to the side, and the body hid behind the trunk of the road, and took out a human finger and finished the finger. Next, then on your jacket a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then his body quickly became transparent and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This side does not rely on anything, standing on the edge of the street with a cane, and then adding a night clock to himself, the eyes swiftly swept move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Disappeared? Escaped? No, it is stealth!" Su Ge once again released the aftermath of the late bell between the electric wildfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after the wave was just released, Su Ge suddenly found out that he was right beside him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A powerful spur directly cut the barrier of the night bell, and then fired almost at the muzzle in front of Su Ge’s head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is beyond the limits of human dodge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔蹦, the sound of the trigger hook is so harsh at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goodbye!" Hayden's mouth with the smile of the winner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when Hayden was ready to watch Suger’s head hit by his own bullets into a pile of carrion, he suddenly felt a sigh of relief in front of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next blink of an eye, he saw his bullets pass through Suge’s head and hit the tree trunk in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bullet is very horrific and corrosive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hitting a willow tree of ten centimeters in diameter, the entire trunk was corroded in a pungent taste for three seconds, and the waist was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Su Ge, who had escaped the attack, was arching forward, and the cane in his hand instantly turned into a sharp blade, and he intended to directly smash Hayden’s body into two. half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Hayden is not a vegetarian, his body suddenly retreats backwards, while holding his left hand on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔蹦! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like the sound of a long sword slashing on a stone, after a very difficult blockage, Su Ge’s sword has no extra momentum and strength to continue. Sniper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haiden’s mouth was armed with a firearm, and the other hand grabbed his chopped arm and jumped back and forth twice, pulling away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
