			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the furious Macock, Roland's face became paler, and the body struggled and found that his arms were not able to break free by the two big men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fist is about to lie on his face again, Roland does not close his eyes and wait for the other women, but keeps his eyes open. Loud: "Don't let those ghost things devour your sanity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't teach you to teach me, swearing!" Macock opened his mouth The saliva is flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge can't really look at this side, the body is a step forward, directly across the distance of two meters to the side of Macock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palm of the hand quickly spread out, accurately grasping the wrist that Macock is about to fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arm muscles squirmed, and Sug pulled Ma Kock’s wrist and pulled him aside and said, “Sir, please keep your reason.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captured Maccock suddenly turned pale, and the green eyes were full of turbidity and violentness. The other hand slammed into Su Ge's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s body slightly crossed, and the stick of his hand was stuck in his arm. Immediately after the cane pushed forward and flipped, the other hand twirled Makok's wrist, and then the cane was inserted from the right side and stuck to the elbow of his left arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, Su Ge, like a juggler, locked Makok’s arms with his hands behind his back with one hand, and his body struggled regardless Nothing can break free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...!" Roland and Jack, who had just ran over, saw this eyes stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are senior police officers, fighting techniques and techniques are not proficient, but they are also often useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, two people have never seen such a clean, efficient and fast cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This set of actions is calm and calm, and even gives two people a feeling of "this is art." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge here is very satisfied with the eyes of two friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The pain of these days is not eaten, this set of techniques is really good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Before training, Su Ge is very clear about his strengths, that is his own cane and god processor. So when I first entered the training field, Su Ge made it clear that I hope to combine my fighting skills with my own cane. It doesn't matter if it is difficult, but it needs to be efficient and rapid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of requirement is naturally not a problem for the expert-level fighters. By combining combat, fighting, picking, and combat, it is specially designed for Su The grid has designed a set of "Kung Fu" that requires a high degree of understanding and proficiency for learners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past ten days, Su Ge has made rapid progress in the process of being stunned by the instructors, and now he is fully in control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused Macock was slobbering at this time: "What are you looking at? Hands-on! Kill me!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two brawnies hesitated after listening to their faces, their eyes flickering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not to say that the opposite is the church’s senior clergyman, just from this set of techniques, two people know that they are not alone. opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That, sir, calm down first, do I think there is any misunderstanding about this matter?" asked the bearded temper on the left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were not affected by mystery, and both of them also felt the eccentricity of their own husband, and their hearts were full of doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makok still talks here, but Su Ge holds his mouth in one hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Su Ge twisted his head against his own eyes, releasing the spirit to whisper and whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the voice of Su Ge, watching Su Ge’s eyes filled with soft psionics, the struggling Makok gradually calmed down, then the eyes gradually closed On, actually slept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the new skill that Su Ge has mastered for ten days: Ning Shen hypnosis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the comfort of the two-eyed psionics, with the meditation of meditation can make people's spirit enter the most comfortable state and instinct to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug pulled out the cane stuck in his arm and looked at Roland and said, "Look for a place, let me see what the problem is."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland listened to the grateful nod and turned his head and said: "Let go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two look The arrogant arrogant man loosened his hand, and the random bearded man laughed and said: "This adult, isn't there anything we have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg thought "If you want your home to get a cure, then help me drive the car and let the wind go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem! Absolutely no problem!" Dahan chick nodded like a glutinous rice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack gasped and walked over and said, "Where are you going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland Silence Let’s say: “Go to the private clinic of Markock! Today’s holiday, it will be relatively quiet.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened and nodded and agreed: “Good !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two brawny self-reportedly said: "I lead the way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the pedestrian boarded the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack did not come over and stood outside and said: "Today, after all, I have to be on duty, I can’t leave the post together. Go, let me leave the rest. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Jack." Roland said in a positive color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days, thanks to Jack’s help, she has already collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack smiled: "We have known each other for so many years, and we are still polite."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge silently glanced at Jack and said in his heart: "I hope they are really friendship between the two, otherwise..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of this, Su In my mind, I have already added at least 52 episodes of dog blood romance drama. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a kind of love called letting go..." The heart couldn't help but sound the painful song. Sugerton felt a liver pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong with you?" The carriage started, and Roland looked at Su Ge with a look of curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge recovered from the brain and smiled: "Nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Auntie! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack standing in the snow sneezed and licked his nose and said, "What happened? Is this a cold?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up at the wagon that is gradually going away, Jack sighed: "Suge, hurry up and get this thing done. Because this thing has been pestering me all the time, I haven't Time to play cards!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack turned and said: “Fiancée? Married? Hey, where is the woman’s Quent brand interesting?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Jack took out a set of brass pieces from the police uniform with a beautifully patterned card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rough big hand holding this deck, his face is careful: "For this limited set of northern decks, this half-year salary is so dripping "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, but it's worth it, I have to win a lot this evening!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge, who is sitting in the carriage, never dreams that Jack’s enthusiasm for helping Roland is because he is playing cards, and he reaches out and moves like a doctor on Macock’s body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of Su Ge’s new skills during this time: Psychic Detection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the basic skill of many exploratory occupations, this psionic detection method can form a simple array through the spiritual connection by injecting psionic energy at a specified position. You can simply see what's going on inside something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
