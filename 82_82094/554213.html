			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leading mountain range, the core of the six leading interchanges, has a very large space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This space presents a regular twelve-sided shape, and the neat walls are engraved with strange runes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless bones piled up on the ground, and countless ghosts come here from all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle, there is a tall altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle of the altar is a mass of material that is full of strange brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This material has the same shape as the outside, like two pyramids at the top, showing an hourglass shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its form is so vague that it seems to be on the verge of illusion and reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an endless ray of light inside, which has tens of thousands of colors that humans cannot describe, constantly flickering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless bands of light emanating from its center, supporting the huge illusion of the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the holy grail of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the giant emperor stood alone in the soul of the Holy Grail, four faces full of doubts and puzzles: "What is going on? The shape already has The sacrifice of the soul has also been completed. It is clear that there is enough content. Why is the Holy Grail still in this illusory form?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present situation, and What he expected was completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because in this original plan, the Holy Grail has fully appeared and is in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't that guy fool me!?" The face on the left side of the giant flashed a question, the face on the right was full of anger, and the face on the back side was written Thinking, the face on the front is still in the holy grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he felt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...nothing!" The frontal face was instantly covered by horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because at this moment, he feels that his wife... is dead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible! No cleric can come there!" The giant was extremely angry at this time, then he suddenly turned and rushed to see Look at the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a lot of pale white light permeated from below the ground, with an indescribable power and brilliance into the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This power and brilliance is huge, just like the essence of a giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After getting so much power, the giant suddenly found that the ecstasy of the Holy Grail actually had some solidification trend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the surface of the shackles, some geometric lines appear, which seem to be gradually changing from illusion to entity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that...the original!" The giant saw this, and the four faces had different expressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, there are bitter smiles, surprises, and flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After so many years of persistence, they have neglected a very important and fundamental thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summoning of the Holy Grail is a painful price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price is naturally to quell the anger of the Holy Grail being summoned, and all summoners must offer everything to the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, all who summon the Holy Grail will be killed by the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Giant and the Queen thought that they could escape the bad luck by taking off the human form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they didn’t expect that everything was already destined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! No! My destiny is in my own control, there must be other ways! There must be!" The giant gave up at this time to find Su Ge, sit Contempted in a huge space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bottom of the underground palace, Su Ge saw that the queen had become a normal person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just after her death, her huge body began to disintegrate rapidly, as if giving her the power of this power is taking back this power . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swollen body and the surrounding guards gradually melted, and then like the boiling water, turned into countless steam, and finally turned into countless lights disappeared . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point everything is back to normal, and the newly crowded underground palace suddenly becomes empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only half of the Queen’s body fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the body gradually shattered and turned into a pile of fly ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has evolved from a high-level biological form to a human form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the failure of evolution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure represents death, and it is the kind of death that has no bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind her, there is a strange altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the left side of the altar is a statue of a woman who squats on the ground and curls up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statue looks strange because the woman’s head has completely exploded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole statue was carved at the moment of the explosion, just like a real person, lifelike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain can be splashed in the head, the skull bursting, the eyeball that is about to fly out of the eye, and the twisted cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statue on the right is a headless woman who bends down and stretches out her hand as if to pick up something, and the style of the statue in Byron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the two statues, there is a skull with five heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black skull is full of cracks, with six holes in the face that symbolize the eyes, and the mouth is raised high like a beast's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skull seems to have not completely rotted, and there are a small amount of hair on the top of the crack, which is very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew stepped forward and looked at it carefully and nodded: "Yes, it’s Carl's skull."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looks at this Carl's skull, his brows are slightly wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shape of the skull he seems to have seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Blood Library!" Su Ge thought of it suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the Shengxue Library is a huge skull, and the shape of the skull is very similar to this, except that the skull is larger than the skull. Too much too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Andrew came forward to put the skull away, but when he was halfway through, he suddenly remembered what Sug had just said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of silence, his body retreated to the side: "Give it to you, I hope you will fulfill your promise."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s demeanor nodded seriously and reached up and hugged Carl’s skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he hugged the skull, he suddenly felt a whirlwind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he felt that his spirit was greatly distorted, as if he had been pulled away from his body by a tremendous force and entered a new world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a shack, Su Ge found himself sitting on a nanmu chair . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some books on the table in front of him. Sug can’t see the contents of the book, turn around and look around, still can’t see the situation around. Everything is so embarrassing, I can only feel that I seem to be in a study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the chair activity sounded, and Suge turned his head and saw a man sitting across the table with a book in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book is very worn, the cover is gone, and some bulk pages are temporarily nailed through a hoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man put the book on the table and looked at Su Ge: "The person who carries the dreamy atmosphere finally came to the depths of this nightmare."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge slightly moved his body and looked down at himself. The clothes he wore had not changed, indicating that he was himself, not someone else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not rush to answer, looked at the man, and tried hard to think about the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man has a white hair, combed into a pony tail and placed behind his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two purple inscription tattoos on his cheeks under his eyes. He is handsome and temperamental, and he is a great professor of scholarly family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wore a vintage black and purple robes, full of years of heavy feelings and rituals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a dream?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man nodded slightly, his voice softly said: "This is the dream in the dream, the deepest part of the nightmare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suggton was at a glance, then sat down on his body and gradually became confident and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should be the son of Byron the Great, Carl?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man smiled and said: "I am a person who carries a dreamy atmosphere. My name is Carl Byron, a loser."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's subtle ritual: "My name is Sug Sotos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sotos!?" By the last name, Carl was flashed in the eyes filled with gray light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s mysterious said: “You should know what this surname represents.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carr shook his head: “Unfortunately, I don’t know. Because All the secrets about this surname have been erased by time and annihilated by space. It can only exist in delusions and legends, and will never be true."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg heard this and immediately silenced: "Sure enough, not so easy to know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a lot of questions to ask you, Can you answer me?” Su Ge looked at him seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Car smiled and waved his hand: "It’s rare to come to the guests, don't talk about the terrible things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge did not ask, smiled and said: "That would be a bit of pleasure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no concept of time in the dream, now Cabatos College How long has it been destroyed?" Carl asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge replied: "There is more than 10,000 years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! It seems that I have also become an ancient figure." Carl said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the legendary character and curiously asked: "It is said that when you left the college, there was no problem with Kabatos College. Did you foresee the ending of the college?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carr nodded: "At that time, the dean was crazy, I don't think it will continue. So I left the college to find a way to redeem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Found?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course Carl." Carl smiled happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's curious questioning: "How about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I summoned my ancestors Then, with me as the medium, I will pull the distorted college into the depths of dreams."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
