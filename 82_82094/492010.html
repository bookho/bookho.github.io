Seeing Su Ge took the lead in praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall heard it very happy and hurriedly bowed his head: "Thank you for the approval of the Lord. The Lord has given me strength to free me from the curse of the blood, I must fight Everything you do will not disappoint the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked up and asked: "Is there anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to my investigation with Gerlos, the cold-blooded church is now tracking the Frost Witch, their people have arrived, but they are still in the dark, not appearing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cold Church? They don't have a dungeon maze, what do the trolls do?" Su Ge had some surprises. Randall explained: "The cold-hearted church once mastered the Holy Grail, and there should be some related connections. In addition, they call the Frost Witch the key, it seems What to get through her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are they going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall Slightly apologetic: "The one we caught is a small leader. It is completely unclear about the core plan. It is just that I want to grab it back. I don't know how to grab it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge asks: "What about other aspects?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hunter seems to have fought with a certain person, blood from half A hillside on the mountainside extends all the way to the top of the city. According to the dryness of the blood, there are at least twenty days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twenty days?" Su Ge The brow picks: "Isn't that the first time the witch is out of control?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Randall nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s hands behind him fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, Frost Witch, what are you going to do?" Randall asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge indulged: "I will ask her about her situation. You and Gerlos continue to wander around and keep their mystery. Now many forces, including the three churches, will treat you two as Asia. People in the ancient city, this is very beneficial to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let your enchantment go in and find the Frost Witch, let her sleep with peace of mind."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Please wait ten minutes." After that, Randall quickly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Randall left, Su Ge looked at the gray sky, slowly closed his eyes and waited quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was passing by the sound wave when he came back today, capturing the psionic volatility of a frosty witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to go directly into the dream of the Frost Witch through this psionic wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the premise is that the Frost Witch is in sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? Sleeping in a dream?" A cold, arrogant voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge opened his eyes and turned to look at the four-crowned crown, Vanas wearing a black gold robe stepped on black round-toe high heels. Get out of a black atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "How is the church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just leave the day, What can I do?” Vanas was very rude to come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at her and sighed: "How is it so hot today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look To you, I am not too angry." Vanas responded coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge doesn’t care about her attitude, smiles: “Thank you for the bookmarks you made, it’s very convenient, and saves me a lot of things.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哼." Vanas’s nose snorted, slightly raising his smooth chin and looking away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continued: "There is a taste on your bookmarks, it's very fragrant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!?" Vanas cleaned his black eyebrows and picked his face with a hint of anger. This time he seized the opportunity and suddenly reached out and grabbed Su Ge's ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Su Ge suddenly suffered a while and screamed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at Su Ge’s painful appearance, Vanas’s annoyance gradually changed into a satisfying and happy, beautiful lip line showing a proud arc: “ Do you really think that I have nothing to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge noticed her subtle delight and asked for mercy: "I am wrong, the Pope, Bypass me!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas’s holding the left ear of Su Ge seems to feel very good, and the delicate white fingers are loose. When I opened it, I still smashed it in the ear of Su Ge. I don’t know why it feels very comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly let go of his hand, Vanas feels a little out of order, hurriedly put his hands under his long hair behind him and turned to look elsewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at her beautiful, glamorous side face and smiled secretly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not the kind of nephew who likes to tease women. His main purpose is to make Vanas not so lonely and lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the stability and improvement of rights, combined with her knowledge of the Great God, her morphological thoughts will gradually be separated from everyone and become a true loner. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soge does it so that the connection between the two will not be cut off and will continue to deepen over time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as he is a human, then Vanas will retain a certain humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he used to have a relationship with Ada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing here? Is there nothing going on there?" Vanas asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said: "A witch is caught by the Nighthawk Church, we are ready to rescue. But I have to determine the situation first. Waiting for her to fall asleep, enter her dreams. Take a look at it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas looked at Su Ge slightly: "You are really bad taste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this bad taste?" Su Ge stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas said calmly: "Human dreams are a gathering of thoughts and memories. Although they may be frantic and disorderly, they can reflect one's heart. A lot of secrets. You enter the dreams of other people and there is no difference between stealing someone else's memory and entering other people's brains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge asks: "Then I How is it into a desolate and dead bone in your dreams?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas’s face suddenly appeared a little unpleasant, silently said: "Because that is me Scenes that often appear from small to large, now with the integration of knowledge, have solidified into a world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, I still want to see you What is in my heart." Su Ge slightly regrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hands behind him are tense and tight, Vanas snorted: "boring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge did not pay attention to the details of Vanas, recalling that when he entered the Green Marquis dream, he did see the most fragile and softest place in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is also very helpless." Su Ge spread his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The bad taste is bad, you can let the knight bring them into this country of God. If you want to peep, just say." Vanas has given Su Ge hit the label. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the kingdom of God in front of him, and his voice was flat: "What is the king's kingdom and the dog can come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wanaston took a look and turned to see Su Ge’s silent speech. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not everyone will join the church, and rushing to bring those people into the kingdom of God will only expose our biggest cards. So I will risk being those Twisting the danger of smashing dreams into other people's dreams to test and contact."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to this, Vanas lowered his proud head with his face Self-blame said: "My thinking is still too narrow and naive, sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge walked over and reached for her on the shoulder and patted it: "No need to apologize, knowing my good intentions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, He touched the soft silky emperor's robe, and the thin jade robes could feel the jade inside, full of elastic skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas nodded slightly with a little thought, then immediately felt a hand on his shoulders and touched it, very arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, I’m going to fly out of Su Ge’s hand, she whispered coldly: “Let’s go!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sughaha smiled: "Don't mind too much, everyone is your own."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait without Vanas, Su Gedao:" Oh!? Has it started?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Su Ge’s body took off and entered the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up at the direction in which Su Ge disappeared, Vanas grinds his silver teeth, his teeth bite his red lips, his brows are slightly wrinkled, his face With a complex emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can fly in the kingdom of God, how much gift did the Lord give you!" Vanas was not reconciled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now she is like a classmate with Su Ge, she regards Su Ge as a goal, her heart is more energetic, want to win more appreciation and attention from the teacher. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought the gap between the two people has been reduced a lot, and even has a side by side trend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at first glance, she found that there is still a huge gap between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turned to look at the shoulder that had just been touched by Suge, the kind of fine friction that gave her a special feeling that made her instinct It feels very comfortable, but it is somewhat disgusting in reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low-level form is not qualified to touch your current body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contemplation she returned to her dreams, sitting on the sacral throne and looking at the clouds, the unusually oppressive sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly the dark clouds in the sky tumbling like boiled water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas said with dissatisfaction: "It’s coming again, this low-level stock!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; After the violent tumbling for a while, the clouds gradually spread out, and the sky suddenly became bright and wide, and the clouds were cloudless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blue sky, some images flashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The image can see a man and a woman walking in the flower, the woman is happy to lean on the shoulder of the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking around, two people sat down in the flowers, and finally they huddled together and gradually retired their clothes. After the flowers and rains, they reached the great harmony of life. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Selling goods! I don't know shame, I am a woman who is squatting!" Looking at the scene, Vanas was more angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the heroine of the two is her own, it is still in the mortal form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the hero, naturally is Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spring dream Vanas has done it many times, and then stopped with the fusion of knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as the form changes, the traces of the past will become stronger. To open up space in a dream is a deep memory that cannot be avoided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Vanas can only use force to suppress those things in the cracks of dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, dreams stem from her own and cannot be suppressed forever. As a result, the situation will just appear on a regular basis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the high form of his own contempt for the low form, for the denial of the past, she also appeared in a situation similar to that of Su Ge, not only crazy about himself I still take it for granted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the image in the sky subsides, the dark clouds reappear and the world returns dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
