Evan asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge shook his head: "I am not a class with them, it is best not to have any intersections, if it really happens, it is the first time, then There will be a lot of trouble in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, you are now highly weighted, the more relationships, the more burden you have." Evan nodded with deep agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he asked again: "Then you should have seen a lot of female mysteries? Do you like it? You are not too big, even if you are not married, the physical problems are also Need to solve it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger said with a wry smile: “How are you so gossip today?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Evan smiled: "It’s curiosity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at him with a smile and said: "Physiological problems definitely need to be solved, but Well, I am not the kind of casual person. Even if you are looking for a woman who has a relationship, you need to be cautious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a goal?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squinted and immediately jumped out of Vanas’s fierce and strong white rabbit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should be there!" Su Ge’s feelings for Vanas are still very good, and Vanes’ style is also a very cold queen he likes very much. system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who!?" Evan came to an interest after listening, and hurriedly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and waved: "Not sure, let's talk about it later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still shy!" Evan said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge did not explain, just when the meal came up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get ready to eat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having lunch, just two people hanging out on the street At the time, a young man came to the two with respect and respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Bishop Sotos." The youth body is slightly confessed, politely say hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s mouth reveals a smile: “Is Mr. Bart still okay?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This youth is The young man who first introduced Bart was affiliated with the Gil of the Green Flame Brotherhood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack smiled noddedly: "Mr. Bart is very good, he asked me to congratulate you and congratulate you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Evan curiously asks: "Your acquaintance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not really, he is an acquaintance."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack here is facing Evan: "Hello, Mr. Marton, our mechanical grader is very high on your improved steam engine. If you plan to apply for a patent and start your own business, You can contact us at any time. With this relationship of Bishop Sotos, I can provide you with a very generous low-interest loan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avon I heard some curiosity: "How much can you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"2000 Langke." Jike smiled and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this number, Avon was shocked and asked: "You are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I am the head of the investment company in Bain, you call me Jike." Jike speaks very skillfully, and the tone is peaceful, whether it is a sentence or a voice, it makes people listen very much. Comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tour Investment Company!" Avon was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company is a giant in the financial world. After the trade bill was fully implemented, the company was the first international company to start a transnational, cross-continental investment company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the market share is divided up by other companies, he is still the leader in the financial industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this company famous?" Su Ge saw Evan's shock and asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interlacing is like a mountain. With Su Ge’s current position and knowledge, he has never heard of the Tour Investment Company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan looked at Su Gezhen’s look and asked with a weird question: “Are you kidding me?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amount...I really don't know." Su Ge had no choice but to spread his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan sighed: "I don't know how your bishop is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sughaha, then asked Jike: "Should it be something to come to me suddenly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jick nodded and hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan spread his hand: "Well, I am not in this circle, I am going to the tobacco shop over there waiting for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, turn and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Evan left, two people sat on the bench on the street, and Jike whispered: "Bishop Sotos, we need your help. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge brows a head: "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sacrifice of blood, You should know?" asked Jick tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "Know that the Admiral seems to have sent someone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Jack whispered: "With the information we get, the sacrifice of blood is not a mere secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? You know so much." Su Ge asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jike’s polite smile: “You know, there are many times when money is omnipotent.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge smiled and motioned to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The whole secret of the blood is actually a shell. After getting enough blood sacrifices, you can open the magic array. This magic array is hidden. A book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squinted: "It doesn't seem to be a general book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This book is called "The Book of Frenzy" and requires 30 points to read." Jike knows a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the name, Su Ge did not speak and looked at him calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of his skills to learn. If you don’t understand what you don’t understand, then you can do it without speaking. If the other person asks for you, then you will Take the initiative to say what you need to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jike licked his lips and continued: "The book of Frenzy is just a low-level secret treasure, some of which are about the most primitive and frantic knowledge of human beings. But the focus is not on this book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Jike’s eyes flashed with dazzling light: “This book and the other four books are a set. These five books are the external scripts of the legendary magic book "The Book of Assos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this Su Ge’s heart suddenly shakes, the heart can’t help but start to accelerate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious realm is the legendary ultimate magic book: The Book of Assos, which claims to have the knowledge of destroying the world. Those who hold this book will be qualified to reach all sources and become the masters of the entire world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of this book is not a secret, but almost no one knows what this "Astos" stands for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are five foreign scripts in The Book of Assos. The book of the Dead (not the book of death) is one of the five external codes, and the names of the remaining four foreign languages ​​are rarely known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mysterious world, the existence of the book of Assos is even more illusory than the Holy Grail, because the Holy Grail has been determined to exist for many years, and even some people insist on it. The reason why the three churches have such a powerful power is because they have mastered three holy grailes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the book of Assos has never appeared, and people don’t even know the names of the remaining four. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, in order to find the complete book of Assos, it is necessary to have five books at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know what the name stands for?" Su Ge asked as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jick nodded: "The power that rules the world and reaches all sources."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su The deep eyes flashed a trace of light and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jike continues: "These really valuable information will tell you for free, counted as the sincerity of our cooperation."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did you get the information?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jike’s face with a proud answer: “Of course it’s our exclusive secret.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Suge recalls that Turzcha, as the flame dancer of Assass, does have a relatively similar relationship between the two. This group of people who believe in Turzcha knows something about Assos. It is also normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you want to finish, Su Ge asks casually: "What is the purpose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is Your home, I only hope that you can share with us after getting the book of frenzy," Jike said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, is there any other organization that knows about this?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jike shook his head confidently: "I don't know, I don't know, this secret is exclusive to our Green Flame Brotherhood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, there are other Is it something?” Su Ge stood up and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jike is a little embarrassed and stunned: "We want to open an investment branch in Guinness, don't know what you mean?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge glanced at him and patted him on the shoulder and said, "You can consider it, but next time you have a certain right to speak, understand?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand! Understand! Hehe! Understand!" Hearing that Su Ge did not say anything, Jike knew that his task had been completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came here not to negotiate, and even the focus is not on the so-called frenzied book, but on the taste of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad knows very well about Su Ge. After hearing the news, he knows that Guinness is completely sheltered by the church of the late bell, and the entire nobles and even the royal family will surrender. Under the gods behind Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the only place to enter the night of the night and the storm plateau and important springboard, the Green Flame Brotherhood people know the importance of their location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at Jike’s departure, Su Ge was lost in thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The book of Assos, the ultimate taboo book finally appeared. Stupid humans actually used that existence as the source of knowledge and one A kind of power? It’s ridiculously ignorant.” Su Ge’s sneer from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They only know that Assass is a name, even thinking that this is a human name, a human who once reached the source. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don't know how terrifying the name is, how desperate and crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the deity of Assos and the current situation, I can almost estimate the remaining three books. Without exception, it should It is The Book of Darkness, The Book of Stain, and The Book of Chaos.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
