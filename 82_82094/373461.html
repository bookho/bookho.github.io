			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the moon was put down, the spacecraft left at a constant speed and disappeared into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fall on the ground, tall and fat, it seems that at least seven or eight hundred pounds of moon beasts calmly toward Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, a hoarse voice was heard in the mouth: "My little slave, don't hide, I have found you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge here, after confirming that the spacecraft has left, walked out of the rushing trees, staring at the moon beast and saying first: "You are a group of Yi people, how are they all long?" Ugly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is in a dreamland, the spiritual system of the material world has disappeared, so Su Ge can see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Moon Beast knows the human language, naturally knows what this ugly word means, and the tone suddenly sinks down: "A despicable bug, your inferior aesthetic is completely I don't know what is truly beautiful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the spear in the hand shot, a big net descended from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug saw a move in his heart, and the ripples of the bells gathered together under the control of powerful psionic powers, and suddenly slammed forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the high-pressure sonic blade will open the big net from the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Moon Beast sees this again and makes a sound: "Oh? Is it the mystery of human beings? Those who want to steal the knowledge of my master and get the advanced worms that evolved?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugghe smiled: "Who is a bug is determined by a fist, not a mouth. Oh! Right, you don't seem to have a mouth!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The disrespectful guy, you are no longer qualified to become a slave." The spear in the hands of the beast flashed in a flash of light, and a dazzling laser shot directly at Su Ge’s head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge suddenly raised his right hand, actually directly blocked this kind of laser-like attack! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." I felt the black glove, and the mood of the moon was obviously astonishingly surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug another hand waved forward, and the sound wave blade cut directly to its body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is obvious that its armor is not made of conventional materials, and it actually blocks the acoustic blade, leaving only a slightly deep dent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sound knowledge? Bug, you know too much!" The moon beasted and said, the other hand suddenly pulled out a purple Chains, suffocating Su Ge, and then the claws pulled the Su Ge directly in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put the spear back to the back, two huge claws pinch the body of Su Ge, a lot of pink tentacles near Su Ge face: "whip, hammer, Soldering iron, laser, which one do you prefer?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled slightly: “Sorry, I am not interested in sm.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A loud bell suddenly came out, and the moon beast suddenly found that Su Ge’s body began to violently shake. This frequency of shaking is very fast, and it makes it somewhat faster. Can't hold it anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three seconds, a bang, the chain wrapped around Su Ge suddenly broke into a section of scrap iron, as if it was hammered at high frequency Knocked and smashed the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuge who broke free, the palm of his right hand straightened to form a hand knife, and suddenly stabbed at a speed that was incomparably fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, Suger’s palm is like a sharp blade, piercing the armor of the moon’s body, and the whole arm is pierced into its body. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bug! You are looking for death!" Feeling severe pain, the moon beast screamed in anger, and the two claws caught Sug's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of a late bell, all the sound waves are all gathered on the right arm of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Su Ge’s right arm is like a meat grinder that rotates at high speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the moon beast that just stretched out his claws began to tremble violently, and a mad scream was heard in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, this huge body crashed to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge licked the pink mucus on his arm, his brow wrinkled, and his face looked disgusted: "It’s disgusting."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a slight cleansing and very hates the slimy stuff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that this thing has died, Sug turned to look at his equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These equipment should be bound to the Moon Beast. If you want to bring it back, it will be included in the vision system, not only can not be used, even touched ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, time is tight, communicate with the gods quickly, then go back. The first time I entered here, the connection seems to be not stable, If you can't go back, you'll have trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Su Ge quickly left, ready to find a safe place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about two minutes after Su Ge left, a middle-aged man in a gray suit and holding a lantern appeared in the moon with a ray of light. Beside the beast, I looked at the wounds of the moon beast, and the viscera that was smashed. Under the cap, the mouth of the white scorpion was slightly tilted up: "Is there a singer of the bell? The body is still full of dreams. Tens of thousands. Years have passed, it seems that the mystery in the real world seems to be developing very well!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he looked up and revealed a pair of pale, scary eyes without pupils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is time to see one side!" He said, his body turned into a ray of light and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This side, after cleaning the mucus on the arm by the river, Su Ge looked around and confirmed the safety around him, he found it is wide The big tree in the canopy sits up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two cold flame elves were released for warning, and Suge closed his eyes and entered a state of meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Su Ge can be sure that he has not entered his sleep, but he clearly feels that his soul is following a kind of traction and leaves his body and flies to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher the flying, the more quickly Su Ge broke through the clouds, saw countless fogs, heard countless weird embarrassments, and saw some invisible shapes. Winged monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, Su Ge felt stunned from the world and entered an empty world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are gray walls on either side of the world with a variety of tentacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the gray wall he had just left, he turned his head and looked at the sky, only to find it was a dark abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here is!" Seeing this, Su Ge’s spirit suddenly turned over, and it was discovered that this is the dream space where the Kingdom of God is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was just a handstand, it felt totally counter-productive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that this space seems to be a special kind of gap. The above is a dreamland, the left and right are the ordinary dreams of human beings, and the bottom is the abyss."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart is thinking about flying to the Kingdom of God not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the big bell through the mouth of the soul, Su Ge feels a special feeling on his soul, seems to be an announcement, seems to be appeasement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling is not finished, he returned to the gods and opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on the throne, Su Ge’s cold eyes with no emotions and fluctuating looked up into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, his eyes saw the flesh in his dreamland through the fog of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The worm-like flesh, although not different from the ant, is not without evolution." The first time I saw my body, this is Evaluation of the perspective of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My god is infinite, and the human body wants to spy on the corners of my strength. I don't know if it is ignorant or stupid. If it is not because you are the human body, I really want to crush you with one finger." Su Ge said slowly. Slowly stand up, the body instantly turns into a mist and disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, he came to the sky and looked at the dreamland through this gray border. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The laws of this world are very fragile and unstable, not suitable for the activities of the gods, but the land of a group of people who are afraid of death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold tone said, his eyes fell on the body of Su Ge: "My heart of hunter is completely integrated into the flesh through the breath of death, and The soul establishes a stable connection, and there should be a possibility of deification in the future. Well, this ugly and fragile form can finally be seen with a little pleasing to the eye."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead The son of the Great God still wants to touch my followers? Even if the body of the guy is just my subordinates, it is really arrogant, it seems that this time you must let you know the end of the anger of the gods."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although it is a poor bug, but since it can promote my gods and activate the heart of hunter hunting, then I will give you a drop of sea water for my endless power! Who makes you a container for me to observe worm activity in the world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of a conversation, something like a black sun condenses in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You now have some knowledge of death in the foundations of the foundations, and the meager and bleak breath of death. Peep into a hair in the dead skin. This is already in place, but unfortunately you are not qualified to take on my strength. In your current situation, you can only temporarily use the corners of the death dominator's power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is the most basic and fundamental authority of the death dominator. You can use this power for 3 hours. This is the limit of your tragic body. It is too fragile!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing his turn, the fog disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a blink of an eye, he returned to the throne and placed the black sun in midair and slowly closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
