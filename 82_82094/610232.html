			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the cry of ruin, the fog behind Suge has suffered a huge shock, and the dense fog has signs of dissipating. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the crucial moment, the pike in Su Ge’s hand suddenly slammed: “Storm!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, countless gusts of wind appeared in this collapsed world, countless black clouds, lightning and thunder surrounded by Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This horrible storm seems to have suppressed some kind of indescribable power, and the whole world has gradually subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opposite, the ugly god was growing up at this time, the whole body was like a monkey lying on the statue, staring at the horrible eyes staring greedily Su Ge seems to have seen the most delicious food in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a shy reminder of Shirley: "The gods can swallow each other. If you lose here, you will have no bones. You should know a lot about things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know very well!?" Su Ge heard this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley said faintly: "When are you dead, dreams, the power of the fog is coming!? Born!?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge was shocked and looked at Shirley’s look a little sluggish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley is not surprised by such a Su Ge, because in this half-year contact, she already knows that Su Ge has forgotten everything that has passed. Things, even those who are themselves, have completely forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not surprising that she is very surprised by this particular relationship. If she can’t forget it, she can’t escape from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because that completely violates the rules, it may even appear from your memory, killing you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her case, she doesn't know what it is. She just faintly knows in memory that the thing is called: calling for the eager monster in the center of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sugg here is not clear about what Shirley thinks. At this time he was surprised that for just an instant, everything has returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because at this moment, he has recovered the full body of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a fog, Su Ge’s body became tall, silver-gray armor appeared on his body, and some silver-white fur shoulders were on his shoulders. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark cloak dances in the air with the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scorpion of the sacred face, a pair of blue flames burning slowly, looking down at the ugly baby indifferently said: "It's ugly."希 /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a very strong direct view of Su Ge’s body, plainly saying: “You are similar.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Attention to your tone, woman." Su Ge turned his head slightly, and the rest of his eyes said with a trace of dissatisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Su Ge at this time is not the ordinary and temperamental person in the weekdays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly looked up and looked at Su Ge and asked, "How? When the power is restored, dare to put a big tail wolf in front of me?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking, wow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shrill baby screaming came again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, there are countless weird ripples along with howling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ripples seem to be the scales of some kind of monsters, and it seems to be the fat that constantly swells under the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world is transformed by this ripple, and it becomes extremely distorted. Everything that is normal becomes abnormal, a drop of water, a hair, a thought It is possible to become a monster of incomparable horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this crying, Su Ge snorted and held a long shot with a long gun: "White Cream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whering...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, countless horrible blizzards appeared out of thin air, the horrible frosty cold instantly reduced the temperature of the entire space to a minimum, countless snow and hoarfrost mixed together, facing Those ripples roared away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, the surging ripples are like the waves that are frozen in an instant, stiff in the air, and even the whole world is frozen. The same, very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Shirley brows slightly wrinkled, because she is very strange to this power, and even has a sense of violation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this power does not belong to this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frosting ability of hoarfrost is very terrifying. At this time, you can see the huge tentacles around, the blue statue, and the gods who are kneeling in the statue are frozen. The crystal statue is motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things are now dead at the moment, only the fog has a breath of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned slightly and asked indifferently: "Women, don't treat my favor with you as your capital."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!? You are fond of me? You dare to say it!" Hearing this, suddenly touched Shirley's taboo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw her white little hand wave, the world’s countless darkness condensed, forming a chilling and strange atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you also have the power of dreams?" Su Ge brows slightly wrinkled. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; outdone snow Leah asked: "Can you have, why can not I have?" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; &nbsp; Su Ge seems to think of something, silence, not speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl certainly does not intend to play with Su Ge here, to disperse the darkness and not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere suddenly became strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it has been in the past, Su Ge suddenly said: “Your body is perfect, I like it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Shirle hands clasped his chest, not salty and replied: "nonsense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bizarre conversation between two people, The frozen space began to vibrate violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the frozen god suddenly stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time his hands have been developed, the body screaming and screaming, and the noise of the baby bursts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Su Ge discovered that there are countless indescribable horror monsters in this deep sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every monster is incomparably different, between real and illusory, in the blink of an eye, in front of Su Ge, another blink of an eye, but has disappeared . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Handle these things first," said Shearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked up and said calmly: "The rise from the abyss, the hoarfrost soldiers who followed the storm, crushed the filth."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, the whole space began to violently creep, followed by lightning and gusty winds, behind a huge solemn battleship behind Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battleship is all-blue in color, with numerous ghosts and ghosts flashing on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast warships are at least three hundred meters in shape, somewhat similar to ancient wooden warships, with wide decks and high masts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the battleship, there were a large number of knights riding ghost ghosts. At this time they guarded the battleships and looked at the ground coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds like the night bell that announces the beginning of the funeral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
