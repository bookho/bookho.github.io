			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the sacred bell, the fear of Iyeta’s heart has returned to normal, and she is still on the ground, looking up at the stranger and Unspeakable majestic figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robes of hunting and flying, like the four dark wings of the gods, combined with the feathers floating in the sky, let her feel even at this moment, their own The master is a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did you see! You saw it!" At this moment, Ieta stood up and stared at Ms. Mei, who was not far away. "This is my master! This is my belief! This is the vision I have seen! You liar! You witch! You can't think about crushing my spirit again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in Yeta, the other mysteries and clergy around me had completely collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time they were ragged, covered in blood, and a screaming scream in their mouth turned and ran towards Ms. Mei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cage of silver shadow has been completely destroyed, and continues to be close to this horrible existence, they only have one dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A group of waste!" Ms. Mei snorted with a sigh of relief, and took out a brand new secret treasure, a colorful stone from the robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the stone was taken out, it first squirmed, and then along with the ray of light formed a huge shield to protect her body in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very reluctant to face the Su Ge at this time, she dare not take risks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at her with a cold voice: "You can die here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After finishing, Su Ge's cane turned into a spear and suddenly raised his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, the vibration and death quickly condensed, forming four dark rifles at the top of Suger's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second was shot directly with a piercing sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mysterious collision, accompanied by a fierce roar, Ms. Mei’s shield like a colorful turtle shell is full of cracks, and it seems to be broken at any time. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suffered such an attack, Ms. Mei was pale, her hands jerked, and numerous cold cold winds appeared, turning into a large number of ice cones and shooting at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of these whistling ice cones, Su Ge took a spear with a spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The innumerable black mist screamed with the spears flying, and instantly swallowed the ice cone and dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Mei’s body was shaken and she was dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of her spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sacred and solemn bell came instantly, like hypnosis, bringing her spirit into a quirky state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the sky, like the gods on the top, interrogating the mortal sounds on the ground: "Human, how do you want to die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...I want to die naturally." Ms. Mei murmured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, just like the gods gave a verdict to the mortal: "Old die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another sacred bell rang and seemed to swear to the heavens and the earth to take effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell just fell, and the miserable cry suddenly sounded in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My face! My face! No! I don't age! I don't age!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"The goddess is on... What happened to this?" The other mysterious man beside Ms. Mei saw such a miserable Ms. Mei suddenly pale and her face was shocked and could not be herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iseta standing behind Su Ge saw this scene is extremely insatiable, and the excitement is somewhat distorted: "Ha ha! You finally have this One day! You have such a day! You old witch! You stink!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not care about Iyerta’s curse, eyes looked at the rest The clergyman took a step forward and raised a long gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, more black feathers are flying in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖嗖嗖嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of broken sounds sounded, and eleven death spears were shot at the top of Su Ge’s head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mysterious spear pierced the body of these people and gave the body an absolute concept of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to terminate life in causality and bring it to death in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, the lineup that was just proud of it has already been wiped out, leaving only three female warlocks with a somewhat sluggish face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feathers are floating, and Su Ge’s body is back to normal, heading for three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people numb and raise their eyes, watching Su Ge have some fear, but more is numb and does not matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyta rushed over and whispered: "These female warlocks were tortured by this old sorcerer and became her slaves and sisters. They are all Innocent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly asked: "Is there a place to go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Three people numb and shook their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart sighed: “Let's go with us.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three men looked at Su Ge and did not refuse, but a mechanical obedience that was very submissive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Su Ge and Lobo left the place with the fastest of five people, leaving only the body of the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than five minutes, Laurie and Archbishop Saru came slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down at the mysterious and clergy who died, and finally the eyes fell to Ms. Mei, who was lying still on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" Archbishop Saru asked Laurie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri nodded: "The strength has improved too much compared to before, the weird inhuman form you should see. That kind of attack actually With a trace of divinity, it is very tricky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop of Saru nodded: "It is really tricky as you say, and you can’t rush. This guy hides There are too many means to go with the Emperor of the Storm, and there are certainly other extraordinary things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie looked around calmly and said: "If we take this time It is estimated that many clerics will be damaged, and the result is likely to be a failure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire battle and strategy are within the control of two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the entire battle process was carried out under the watchful eye of two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the last experience, Laurie’s threat and positioning for Su Ge has reached the highest level of alert. He now needs to constantly learn about Su Ge through continuous trials. The means and strength of today. After everything is known, a hit is successful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is now cautious enough and has enough patience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This female warlock is still alive." Laurie looked down and saw Ms. Mei suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saru said with disdain in his tone: "Although it is a heresy, it is a person who bears the "sky" after all."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
