			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the sudden death of Prince Jean, Oliver’s face can be seen with shock and surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened? How was the mental shackle that I imposed on him suddenly being wiped out by something!" Oliver was full of caution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spiritual shackles are all higher-level abilities in all souls, spiritual related professions, by suppressing the mind and consciousness of other people’s souls , making it a shackle of self-discipline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug does not know this skill, he just just feels that there is a special kind of psionic power in controlling the spirit of Prince Jean, this psionic structure for ordinary People are very special, tricky, but not so strange to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this psionic sequence is very similar to the changes in the spirit of the previous sacred potions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Break this spirit to bind Sug is the effect of Gunnnier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, through an in-depth understanding of the late bell, and after the events of Luke and others, Su Ge found that his late bell had the effect of expelling the negative mental state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge used the late bell to drive out Luke’s embarrassing state and expel the madness of the clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just now, he used this effect to get rid of the state that Jean was controlled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just the eviction state, and the structure of the mental shackles still exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Finn! Mr. Finn! Is this true?" asked the two nobles around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Oliver was just about to explain, Su Ge did not give him a chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not good! Not good!" Suddenly, there was a scream at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of the center of the frightened war turned around and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the door, the two vampire servants who came back according to the instructions were pale and the performance was vivid. "It's not good! There are many people in the middle of the ring who suddenly become wolves! At least a thousand? No! Thousands! The plague is Spread here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hulala...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the crowd is in horror In the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Julie didn't know where to come from, gloomy staring at Oliver: "It's a good calculation! Count us all!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the arrogant Prince Sacco heard his own master's statement, he suddenly panicked: "Oliver! You intend to turn us into Werewolf!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Oliver's face is turned into a target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Finn! Is this true?" asked the two nobles who were with him, pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Finn! Please refute them!" Other aristocratic followers asked aloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver took a deep breath, slowly took off the monocle, and took a black book from his arms and said: "I didn't expect today. Actually, you were disturbed by a foreign fish and shrimp. It seems that I still underestimated the determination of the Church of the Holy Blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, four weeks The nobility suddenly panicked and quickly retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olifo looked around and laughed: "It’s a group of ignorant people. We are helping you to get a more powerful form. This is an evolution. You should be happy to accept."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oliver Finn! Damn! You deceived the Duke’s trust and expectations for you!!" The fat aristocrats of many years old are angry and low-lying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas shouted loudly: "There is no deception, because the Duke of the Mountain is joining forces with him to frame you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing the Queen's words, the nobles turned their heads and glanced at Vanas, and stared at Oliver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver smiled and said: "Of course, I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, he suddenly sounded a gunshot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head exploded, blood splattered, and the pungent bloody smell permeated the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding aristocrats were completely scared, and turned their heads slowly, just to see that Su Ge was holding a revolver and the barrel was still emitting Blue smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The reaction is really fast!" Su Ge said with a big smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver calmly pushed the body of the nobility in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although his posture was calm, his face and body were splashed with a lot of blood at this time, and he looked very embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a silk scarf to wipe the blood on his face, Oliver said coldly: "Is it too small to watch the master's fighting consciousness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, the body quickly retreated two steps, and the two mysterious people stepped forward to protect his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was talking, he noticed that Su Ge’s hand suddenly reached the inside of his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The easiest thing to put there, he is very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment of seeing the gun, he supported the psionic shield and felt wrong at the same time, so he pulled the aristocrats around him and blocked himself. before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as a result, as he expected, his own psionic shield was instantly broken by that bullet. If it weren't for this nobleman, then flowering is his own head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Despicable villain! What are you doing!?" A mysterious person who seems to be very traditional is whispering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug collects the gun and takes it for granted. "If you decide that you are an enemy, you have to take the lead. Is there any problem?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..." The middle-aged mysterious man opened his mouth and didn't know how to refute it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these ordinary mysteries, Su Ge does not intend to waste a small number of bullets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guards! Kill them! Kill them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on! Protect us ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Marquis of Raul, the Marquis of Raul..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden gunshots made the whole hall tangled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Vanas suddenly loudly said: "Calm down! My people! Gathered to my side, the power of the royal family will protect your safety!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, the nobility of the aristocracy suddenly saw hope, regardless of the elegance and calmness of the weekdays, madly gathered around Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood at the forefront and confronted Oliver: "How, Mr. Lord, if you choose to surrender, I can consider giving you a relative A clean cell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver's cold cold question: "Do you really think you won?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge shook his head: "Of course not. I am a relatively cautious person, but I am relatively cautious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he Loudly said: "You are waiting for the plague to spread completely, after we have turned into werewolves, I will shoot it!? And you are not afraid of the plague, I am afraid that there are special equipment and antidote! You really think we will give you a chance What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
