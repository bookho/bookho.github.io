			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 24, 7845, the past six days after the Bain City incident, the Great Aid Force of the Holy Blood Church arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the most serious religious event in the last fifty years of the Berant Empire, this incident killed a total of 35,126 people, accounting for about nine points of the total population of the entire city of Bain. First, the entire city was destroyed by a third, with a combined loss of more than 160 million francs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the whole thing did not spread out before and after the Blood Festival, the church started the most advanced assistance in less than an hour after receiving the telegram. Level, six days have been transported by train a large amount of supplies and a total of 300 clerics to maintain security and confidentiality work here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were several levels of bishops, and the masters of the masters appease the people. On the sixth day, the large units of aid arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this morning, when people looked up, the first thing they saw was two huge ships that covered the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ships are at least one hundred meters in shape and look like an oval shuttle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ships are made of dark steel and are constantly ejecting a lot of white steam at the top and around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On board, standing with armed weapons, standing church soldiers, straight posture, solemn expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they looked at the broken city and buildings in Bain City from the boat, they were shocked and full of sympathy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goddess is on!" On the edge of the ship, a woman wearing a pale pink robes, a slender figure with hands clasped, with a hooded head Low down, whispering prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two silvery hairs slid under the hood from the hood, and with the clean breath, let people see that there is a kind of quiet from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Archbishop, is about to land, please take a rest for a break." Aside, a strong woman came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman is at least one meter tall and tall, full of sturdy body, wearing a silver-white body and full of hard air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most noticeable thing is her silver-white sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great sword is very large, and it is flat with her body. The silver-gray sword is engraved with incomparably complicated lines and runes, and there are still in the hilt. Several switches that can be twisted and pinched, through the embossed hollow of the sword, can see the small and precise gears inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman in the pink robe nodded slightly, giving a clear, faint nasal voice: "May the souls that have passed away return to the arms of the goddess."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, return to the cabin with the escort of the goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the two ship engines is very large. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roaring sound came from the sky to the entire city, and everyone’s eyes were attracted by the two steel ships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then following the reception of the ground clerics, the two ships docked at the corner of the ruins of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the ship of more than 20 meters high stopped, there were more than a dozen hatches around the ship, and the armed clerics under the watchful eyes of the people around The staff and the church staff wearing ordinary robes came out with a lot of supplies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishops responsible for the reception rushed forward to carry out the relevant handover and reporting, and prepared to meet the upcoming Archbishop, known as "Pure Aries": Ai Melia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the grand ceremony was held here, Su Ge was in the northern suburbs of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the blood on his hand, Su Ge bent down and looked at the dead ghoul, sighing: "Not the corpse that was lurking here." Ghost, the remnants of this summoning are a bit serious, and the surrounding monsters and the hidden Yi people are instigating."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, the church's support has arrived." Sister Marlene said as she wiped her short knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge stood up and turned to look at the direction of the city center. "I heard that a new archbishop has come to preside over the things here. Why not Archbishop Gerald?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mermaine Marin said: "I heard that Archbishop Gerlos seems to be a name, and there is no real right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The evil politics." Su Ge spit out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marin smiled and immediately asked, "How, Su Ge, are you ready to take on the great honor?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled and said, "There is some tension."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six days ago, after Adeline After careful design by others, Su Ge was found to be rescued from the ruins when he was searched and rescued by people after two hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the happy cry of the Evan family, Su Ge was quickly sent to the temporary hospital for a simple inspection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the inspection by Father Hank, it was determined that there was no injury except for some bruises, and everyone was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Su Ge thought the plan was perfect, Logan took a group of people and hurried over to surround him in the middle, telling him a big event. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Su Ge hadn’t returned to God after listening to it for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After weighing the pros and cons, Su Ge readily agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the unification of all the cadres, they began to quickly divide the work for post-war rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he helped, he also dismissed Adeline, Hills and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time to come, the whole city will attract the full attention of the church, even if it is hidden deep, in this case it will inevitably leak some flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After pulling the ten people into the battleship and letting them know that the true God really existed, Su Ge was very relieved to let ten of them follow Adeline and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, let Aidelin give them some new identity and restore the normal life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke’s old slicker said to join the church in the late bell, but at the end of the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After identifying the unspeakable situation with the mysterious secrets of the ten men, Luke formed a duo with Clausen. Disappeared in the eyes of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia seems to have a very good relationship and common topic with Hills. After everything is settled, she does not intend to return to the Glorious Church, so she follows Hills. Going back to the night, I started my new experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland, who became a Luke student, did not leave. She had Luke’s enchantment and was able to get the teacher’s education at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now she has established her own path, and first secretly joined the church of the late bell, and then plans to join the Church of the Holy Blood, saying that it is to help Adeline Waiting to monitor the situation of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, she did not become a twenty-five child similar to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation after that is a bit funny, because it is necessary to keep secrets, but because of the good relationship with Su Ge, I don’t know if Su Ge’s identity is very I am very embarrassed to say a bad lie to Su Ge, clumsy to cover up his true intentions and identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acting technique gave Su Ge almost a snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge will certainly not be foolish to dismantle, but instead express his thoughts without much thought and recommend Roland to the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who are in the hands of the people readily agree that today Roland is counted as an intern cleric who works with Father Anthony while studying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days, Su Ge and Marlene’s nuns were responsible for the defense work in the north of the day, destroying all the monsters and the Yi who were close to the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the idle conversation, Su Ge found that Mother Marlene had forgotten everything about Ada, but only vaguely remembered that there was such a People, but the memory of it is like a pedestrian passing by on the street. If you can't remember it, it will not cause any level of doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
