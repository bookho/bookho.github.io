			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Su Ge will confirm the situation and prepare for action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What they seem to perceive, there are three hidden vehicles transporting things throughout the afternoon, and it seems that some people have been transferred from other places. What situation has been stimulated?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiding on the trunk, Su Ge’s heart sinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the case, it should be that the arrest of Hayden and others has stimulated them. The ability of torturers to witness is obvious to all. The existence of Master Mill is not a secret. Do you know how the trial of Master Mill is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a courtyard in the palace, there are sixteen bodies, there are attendants. There are soldiers, assassins, and chefs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side of the body, there are the bodies of these five big mice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the result of Randall’s two days. The spies in the palace were swept away, and the human face rat who came in to wait for the chaos was also taken by his babies. Found that directly killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who pass by and see this horror don’t have much panic and worry because they are the loyal supporters of the Queen who want them Dead traitor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the mysterious workshop of Master Mill, the incomparable miserable screams came out intermittently, making people feel awkward and fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Mil’s face came out gloomyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" Randall asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill shook his head: "The John and the Conte have already recruited, but they are all low-level situations, and they have not touched too many core things. This sea Deng really has enough bones, and now his mouth is still hard, and it is estimated that it will take some time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does your hypnotism useless?" Randall asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is for ordinary people and low-level monsters. The mystery of this strength that has approached the master is very firm, not hypnotism can be shaken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Randall turned to look at the moon outside the window: "I don't know what happened to Mr.."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill beat the dust on his pajamas: "He thought Very meticulous, the problem should be small."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although the core does not know, they have already determined that they will attack the palace, now the traitor has been removed, Elena, etc. People will be liberated and begin to carry out related defense arrangements!" Mill said, leaving Randall to leave quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the woods on the north side of the factory, Su Ge marched cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the observations in the afternoon, it seems to be the only entrance to the underground space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk of this sneak is very large, and Su Ge always releases the night bell to detect the surroundings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After he moved less than ten meters, Yu Bo felt something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two hidden hidden traps, and they are not ordinary physical traps, but rather elaborate psionic traps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I don't know what effect, but the person who can arrange this kind of precision psionic trap is still so subtle, there should be a stalker here. And at least it's expert." Su Ge was very cautious in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the terrain of this forest, the most deadly enemy is the stalker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stalker is a mysterious profession that constantly pursues self-satisfaction. By hunting for prey and craving for spiritual perfection, it greatly enhances its will. And the spirit, the intention to explore the source of knowledge through the incomparably powerful spiritual will, that is, the root of the arrival of all things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can’t go any further. In this environment, it’s not wise to deal with a chaser who is one level higher than me.” I don’t want to talk about turning around and running. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, just as he turned and fled, the two traps ten meters away from him suddenly triggered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!?" Su Ge was shocked. When he was about to run, he found that the branches under his feet were like alive, and instantly became tough. The vines entangled their feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, a black shadow flashed past the moonlight and shot at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger instantly propped up the night bell to protect, while the cane in his hand instantly turned into a long sword, cut to the vines under his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment of contact, the night clock is suddenly broken. And the shadows stopped and landed on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down, it’s a black iron javelin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp swords of the three slashes and five slashes the vines, and Su Ge once again propped up the night bell to protect, the body rushed out of the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when he was less than five meters ahead, he felt a sense of heart and suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pile of spiked wooden poles descended from the sky, squatting on the ground less than half a meter in front of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Day! Where is this thing?" Su Ge did not feel that there was such a thing on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the stake fell and caused a series of reactions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge suddenly felt the ground began to collapse quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Su Ge raised his arm and slammed his claws against the tree not far away, followed by Su Ge’s body flying off the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground is completely collapsed, and under the ground that you have just walked through, it is actually a trap full of thorns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waiting for Sug to breathe, a shrill whistling moment came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slamming, the night bell was once again broken, and the green arrow arrow fell off one meter in front of his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, propped up the third night of the bell, Su Ge jumped and jumped out of the distance of five meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it rolled two rounds on the ground and left the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Sugg standing up, he felt the hair behind his neck stand up, as if a goblin was blowing air behind his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sound, Su Ge suddenly turned back, and his cane barely blocked the jagged chopper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the chopper, a man wearing a tight-fitting camouflage and a black mask gradually emerged from the transparency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You actually escaped!" The low voice took the accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug showed a smile: "This is a subtle trap, admire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak, Raise his right hand and grab his machete and pull out his sword to stab his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for death!" Seeing Su Ge grabbing his own machete, the stalker snorted and slammed his arm, trying to cut Sug's palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the next second, he found that his knife seemed to be cut on the stone, and there was no feeling of cutting the flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This glove has a problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought of this, Su Ge’s sword Has stabbed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in this case, I only saw that he was very dexterous and rolled over on the spot. He barely avoided the thorn and was only cut by the long sword. Broken some skin injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After turning over, his hands were pulled, and Sugton felt his body tied tightly with invisible silk threads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
