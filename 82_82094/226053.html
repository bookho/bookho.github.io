			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 5:30 in the evening, Su Ge and Roland bid farewell to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the Church of the Holy Blood, Suge digested the information provided by Roland: "Hope is the smoke bomb left by the black man!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is now pointing to two of the most powerful and best-known people in Bain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is very reluctant to believe that these two men are the culprit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After returning to the Ziyue Small Lecture Hall for the second Han, Su Ge ran to Ivan here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come in!" I saw the face of Su Ge, Ivan was very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at Ivan that the more serious dark circles sighed: "You, don't stay up all night, so that one day, one day, one day, the body will be broken. I have to go to bed after eleven o'clock, and I can get up early in the morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!" Ivan heard Su Ge’s warnings and did not refute, as if obedient The younger brother, nodded seriously, and felt warm in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, nowadays someone cares about themselves, this feeling is something he has not felt for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit down, Su Ge asked his own question: "Ivan, I remember I said before, the practice of the Faction is not free to move. But today I heard about a process that is constantly changing and moving, causing the entire squad to be completely hidden and unable to find. What is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hearing this, Ivan picked up an apple and took a sip, and the delicate eyebrows gradually gathered together, thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dozen seconds, Ivan suddenly raised his head and said, "If this is the case, there is only one possibility."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They should use a means to determine the external framework of the entire array, so that the entire array can continue Intrinsic, they inscribed the works on some living things with strong mystery. Each living thing is a complete and independent process, if separated from each other, the entire array disappears. These living creatures come together, and these inscribed works will interact with each other, like a steam engine's gears, to form a complete array."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Hearing this, Ivan bit his lip and said: "But this level of ruling is based on at least three yuan and six times, and requires a lot of mysterious material, not to mention the complexity of the constructional matrix, the logic of which alone. And the rationality is no longer a normal person can be counted. Even if the use of the differential machine, it is a huge workload."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this, Su Ge instant I thought of the larvae of the giant worm that was found in the body of Macock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is a larva, there will be two, even a few hundred. The worm itself is a superior independent sect, and the mystery of its own is absolutely enough! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge flashed a shudder in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because if this is the case, then the depth of the black man’s plan is not something he can guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the invitation of the Green Flame Brotherhood until now, all the plans are in a loop, every time when Su Ge feels the key to life, Always be the first step by the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This guy!" Su Ge couldn't help but clench his fists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is this thing to teach you? If you say this, the other person must be at least a master of the rune." Ivan squats My own big green eyes are curious to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug casually smiled and said: "Go out today to perform the task, and occasionally heard, I thought that the person is a nonsense."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You may have missed a rune master, it's a pity!" Ivan looked sorry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge patted him on the shoulder: "Okay, time is not early, I should go back."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? Is this gone?" Ivan was a bit sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge spread his hand: "I haven’t handed in the quest items yet, and I have other things tomorrow, I need to go out."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan suddenly said with a look: "Well, I want to give you the good things I just researched."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? What?" Su Ge suddenly came to interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard Su Ge’s words, Ivan turned and ran to the second floor with a happy face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a minute, he walked down with two boxes and handed it to Su Ge: "This is it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge took over, first opened a long silver box above, and found a very handsome silver revolver inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This revolver barrel is slender and has a huge body shape. The magazine can store six rounds of bullets at a time. The whole body is flashing with a silver-gray metal texture, which is very handsome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug got a feeling of weight, about a pound and a half, with fine runes on the barrel and gun, seemingly mysterious blessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my latest research, through the combination of mystery and mechanics, mysterious costumes, I call it Moon Furan." Ivan looked proud Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug got a pistol and asked curiously: "What is the difference between it and the ordinary hunting pistol?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The difference can be big!" Ivan eyes wide open, his arms wide open, looks very cute, like a child eager to express himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yue Fran is a super-level hunting pistol, she can not use ordinary blood and silver bullets, this is the special bullet I made for her!" Ivan said to open the second box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now twenty-four silver-coloured, full of inscriptions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bullet looks unusual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the ordinary hunting demon bullets are very flat and the texture is somewhat soft. The principle is that after the shot, the blood in the middle bursts out to corrode the skin of the monster, causing damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this bullet is different. This bullet uses a metal warhead, which is three times longer than a normal hunting bullet. The body is glittering and delicate, just like crafts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
