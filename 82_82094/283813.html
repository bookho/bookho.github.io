			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a hunter here?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas smiled and nodded: "Yes, Grandpa Mill is a master of the demon hunter with rich experience and experience. Some research masters, he not only has the powerful fighting power of the demon hunter, but also has great achievements in the research of potions. It can be said that it is the master of the potion in the North!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge nodded with a look of admiration and turned to look at the half-opened gray door and asked: "Is this door open so really no problem? I remember that there are many potions that are volatile. The smell is highly toxic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!? You know a lot." At this moment, a vigorous and powerful voice came from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger heard the turn and looked at it, just saw a blue pajamas with a nightcap, white hair and beard, looks 50 years old The middle-aged people from the left and right walked up the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person looks ordinary, his face is not deep, the square face, the white beard is trimmed neatly, not long or short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this middle-aged man, Su Ge’s look is a bit weird. If it’s not that unique golden erect, Sug can’t completely run this uncle in a pajamas. Combined with the cold and deadly, ready-to-armed hunting demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mir Grandpa!" Seeing this middle-aged man, Vanas brought up the skirt and walked quickly to look happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, Su Ge was completely shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Su Ge’s gaze, the demon hunter burst into tears and smiled, looking at Vanas with kindness: “Your Majesty is really More and more beautiful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it was not the growth of the spirit, but Su Ge felt that his worldview was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hunter is very natural to laugh, it is not a disguise to support it, but a smile from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge has been squatting for several times, and his eyes are still a little bit fascinating, and he reaches out and squats, worrying that he is blind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha! Suddenly going crazy? A little bit interesting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sug’s eyes I heard a hearty smile on my ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Su Ge gave up his resistance and sighed in his heart: "This The world is too deep, I am still too tender."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the hunter of the mir, who stepped onto the steps, and the reality asked Elena: "How about this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also, the problem is not big." Elena licked her chest in the middle of the double peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good, pay a little attention later, the mentality is on the one hand, on the other hand, don't let men take the initiative to touch you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Mil turned to Su Ge, he just knew the sorrow of Prince Saku, and he seemed very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very curious, what method do you use to make his vision skyrocket?" Mil smiled and asked, this smile with the pair of golden erects, giving A feeling of being stared by a poisonous snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling sharp gaze, Su Ge sighed in his heart: "Do the hunters have such terrible insights?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Mill’s pressure on Su Ge is not as big as Geros, the difference between the two is not great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my talent, it is not easy to disclose." Su Ge, who has seen so many big winds and waves, has already practiced and is not humble, lying face is not red. , the powerful ability of not heartbeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina explained: "He is not an enemy, but a good helper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Mill looked at Su Ge for a lap, then turned to look at Tess lying on the stretcher and said, "I know what I have, just give it to me. I will let him know what he knows and don't know." ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on two people and carry him in." Mill waved his hand, and the two apprentices quickly came over and carried Tess in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug saw this corner and smiled and said: "I believe that he will regret it later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you regret?" Elena asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I regret that I didn't kill him at the beginning." It was a very tragic thing, but Su Ge was particularly happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill took a look at Su Ge: "You seem to know a lot about the Demon Hunter, young people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Suge generously nodded and said: "Well, I have a good relationship with a master of the demon hunter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina added: "He also drank the potion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!?" Hearing this, Mile's eyebrows picked up and had a hint of curiosity on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly spread his hand: "The inferior shark potion, the taste and effect make me unforgettable."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The people who lived after drinking the potion are rare." Mill looked at Su Ge with a little interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "Maybe I am lucky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill didn't say much Turned to Vanas and said, "Your Majesty, you should go back and wait. After half an hour, I can let you know everything you want to know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Okay, trouble you." Vanas finished, with Sug and others turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is just about to ask about Mill’s situation, but he’s swallowed back when he’s in his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Asking these questions doesn't seem to be in line with my learned pope's identity, but this thing can't be just that, um er er... I should think about it. The entry point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side of Vanas, he sneaked a glance at the contemplative Su Ge, and he said in his heart: "What is the Pope thinking? Is it because the attitude of Grandpa Mill has felt anger and dissatisfaction?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Vanas’s heart suddenly burst into shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then she shook her head secretly: "It shouldn't be possible, the Pope's broad-mindedness is so harmonious, it's impossible to be angry because of this little thing."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is it because? What details have I not noticed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina whisper Speaking to Su Ge: "If you have a chance, you can get closer to Mr. Mill. Mill seems to be studying new potions for ordinary soldiers. He said that after the human body has survived a potion and recovered, There will be some antibodies in the body, so the effect of poisoning after taking the potion again will be much reduced. The person who has saved the potion has been a rare treasure for him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I heard this Su Ge’s heart: “Is there still such a thing?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the unresponding Su Ge, Elena continues to say "If you need any help, you can have a good relationship with Mr. Mill. If the new potion is researched in the future, you can The first batch of beneficiaries of the concept of zero-day opportunities you should have heard of it "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;!? & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Scotland nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The zero-day business opportunity is something new when others don’t know it, this product is invaluable, and the whole market is determined by you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the premise is not to be too outrageous, and it does have a real effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina said with a smile: "This is a huge business opportunity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge I didn't care too much when I smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when it started, there is nothing too clear about Su Ge’s concept of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he was initially short of money, after entering the church, he did not need to spend his own money for food, clothing, housing and transportation. He had no chance to spend it because he had been learning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
