			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the entrance to the manor, Raul and Julie smiled and gave Sug away, but the smile on his face was a bit stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they suddenly discovered that the forces on the Queen’s side suddenly rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't mean that the Queen is only the disabled hunter, is Mil a master? Hayden's strength is above me, and has approached the master. How suddenly was caught by the inexplicable person!? Did the old guy run out?" Julie asked Gail in a gloomy face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raul’s face shook his head badly: “No! The monster doesn’t know why, for twenty years, it’s not gone out of the palace. According to our current report After the two men fled, Mill's anger was ruined and his face was gloomy, but there was no meaning to chase it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, our royal family is due to the existence of Mill, so I will not hire too many mysterious people on my own initiative. For many years, I have only really had this mysterious powerhouse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juli immediately said: "Go! Contact again Let's take a look at our people and confirm the situation inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour in the conference room, Raul said with a gloomy face: "Our three spies They are all lost, and they are afraid of being fierce."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juli’s heart sinks to the bottom and turns to look at the mask man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mask man gave a low-pitched laugh: "Oh, that's just right, there will be a good show tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the residence of the Marquis of Raul, Su Ge took a carriage to the residence of the Duke of the Mountain Range on the west side of the inner zone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill suspected that the Duke of the Mountain had summoned something. This is a very important and serious problem, and Su Ge’s heart is very concerned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area of ​​the inner area is not small or large, and the road is wide and unobstructed. Sog took 15 minutes to see a towering castle. manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big manor is different from other aristocratic manors. Today, the manor outside is a busy car, a lot of luxurious carriages are parked on the side of the road, and the people wearing the fiber optic cable are walking in the door. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exactly, there are so many people, it will not appear that I am too awkward." Su Ge left the carriage from the faraway, first told the driver to go far, and then walked into the duke of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he approached, Sug’s nose moved and his heart gradually gloomy. In the air nearby, he smelled some familiar taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of taste ordinary people, even normal mysterious people can not smell, only have a special experience, those who have contact with real life outside the realm can smell come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the taste of...the stars." The face of the Su Ge cap gradually became dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This taste is very similar to the taste of Bain City at the time. It’s unclear, the way is unknown, you can’t describe it, but when you smell it, The ability to instinctively feels like something in the outside world and Su Ge’s subconscious mind resonate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough, as Mill said, these guys summoned some that do not belong to this world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Thinking about it, Su Ge looked up slightly at the tall house across the street: "The castle seems to be new. With this time node, the thing that is summoned should be living there." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Su Ge looked at the castle, his inspiration suddenly turned out to be like electricity, making his spirit stinging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Su Ge bowed his head and did not lift his head into the crowd in two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top room of the castle, the red god shook slightly, the pink tentacles squirmed twice, and the two human faces climbed out along the wall... ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge on the road is a little pale, just the moment, he feels something is looking at himself in the opposite direction, scared He quickly cut off his gaze, and even his head was empty and not thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weird existence cannot be described by common sense, they can even find your position through your thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purposeless wandering for about ten minutes, Su Ge returned to the gods and blinked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning around slightly, I found that I was far away from the lively mountain dukes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsettled, Su Ge combined his own understanding of the existence of the analysis: "From the scale of the summoning ceremony, the summoned things should not be Those outside gods and old days, because they have not caused changes in the world. It is even more likely that they are not superior races, and most likely are some lower-level Yi people who have superb wisdom. Because those superior Yi people are generally malicious and contempt for human existence. The summoned moments, the dukes of the mountains, they can't live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, this call is not too much strength to crush, to me This body should be able to deal with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition, this time the outsider should not be the kind of fighting Yi, it should be the kind of wisdom Or, just that glance, put on those violent old brothers, have long been catching up." Su Ge thought of his heart slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just didn't pay attention to it, first make sure there are no followers!" Su Ge thought, releasing the aftermath of the night clock and starting to focus on himself. A spherical ball with a radius of 20 meters is detected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just detected, Su Ge immediately found the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bushes that are more than a dozen meters behind them, there are two mice on the left and right sides of the road that are almost as big as the kittens, and are quietly following themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I can’t see it, from the round head and flat face, Su Ge knows that this should be a human face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, I found out, so let these two mice keep following me? Or deal with it directly here?" Su Ge was caught in a tangled heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still a big stall in the north of the city. This stuff is expected to follow me all the time. I don't have time to mislead them, just kill it!" In my heart, I thought that the two parts of the corrugated aftermath turned into a sharp blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two human face mice were similar when they were killed. Human screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
