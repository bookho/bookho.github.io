			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dream, after two people left, Su Ge sat on the throne and analyzed the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vampires, blood of origin, bloody holy pool, these three keywords should be closely linked. Randall's body does exist There is a huge problem. The blood that is ingested by the outside world is full of his heart and brain, and those things are slowly eating away from his body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vision of the gods, Su Ge has a very good understanding of Randall's physical condition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are some problems in the blood of this world creature. Although there is great power in the blood, it is like a drug three-point poison, every drop of blood is in While giving strength, it is gradually suppressing the user's reason and awakening their animal nature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, more advanced thinking and vision make Su Ge's thoughts Very bold and wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you look at it, the source of these blood problems is likely to be on the three goddesses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The birth of the moon, symbolizing purity and birth; the purple moon, symbolizing mystery and science; the original blood month, symbolizing the original and blood. At the beginning I still do not understand, and fertility and mystery Compared with this term, the blood and the original height are not enough. But now it seems to be fully understood. The original and the blood are complementary. The blood contains the most primitive human violent and animal nature. This situation seems to be now Many people know, but they can't help it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you mention the original blood month, you have to mention the bloody month in April."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This festival is very special. If the festival is used to celebrate, then the Moon Festival is like escaping something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Bloody Day, there will be only a bloody moon in the sky, and the world will be covered by red that night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that night, everyone had to put the good goat blood into a big basin and put it in the doorway. The family was hiding at home honestly. Close the door and the window. No matter what happens, you can't look outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, the family will accompany the "Month of the Moon" to spend the night in prayer and sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun rises normally, everything will return to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in Su Ge’s memory, he will rush out for the first time after the bloody festival every year to see if there is blood in front of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that the blood is cleaned by something unknown, just like the new one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But look carefully and see that there are shallow, non-human scratches on the edges of the basin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows what it is, only the clergy tell them that it is the messenger of the blood moon god, converging blood, and giving blood to each family. The family is blessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Su Ge was very convinced that he now feels an indescribable creep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The red shadow that I saw in the hospital is likely to be my animal nature, but from now on, the problem is not big. It seems that as long as it is appropriate Use does not have much impact. After all, blood therapy has been used for thousands of years, and these people are all living well, there is no end of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking of this, Su Ge is temporarily putting this matter down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, there are cultists in the real world that need to be dealt with. After they return to the real world, they are still looking for me to discuss countermeasures."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge closed his eyes and woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just awakened, Su Ge heard the second body alert and looked at a certain direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned his head and saw that his coat was actually squirming at the moment, forming a strange angle like a stream of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please come to 2399 Jiangyan Street, Northeast City, Adeline." Like a telephone phonograph, the hoarse and hard voice came from the clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erh heard the moment rushing up, biting his clothes and slamming it on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body rushed up, and the claws and mouths worked hard together and violently bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stab! Sting! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shredded sound of the harsh cloth came, and Sug sat on the bed and couldn’t get back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a dog day! This is my only new suit!" For a moment, Su Ge jumped up and looked at the second big call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just saw it very clearly. At the beginning, Erha was really worried, but when the clothes were pulled down, the last psin above could be said. It completely disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erh also felt it, but at that time it could not restrain himself from breaking the instinct of this thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrow has to be sent on the string... No, it should be the family that has to be removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After it, it gave up reason and conformed to its own instincts...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not good The second screamed, and he slammed into the bottom of the bed, not coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s face was so distressed that he had picked up his torn black suit and couldn’t help but twitch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly turned around and found that Erha slightly leaked his head out, and the blue eyes looked at Su Ge with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜! Hey! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whispered a few times, and Erha came out, but hesitated and then went down to the bottom of the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bed itself is very low, and the size of the second big horse is very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge was suddenly teased by the stupid look of Erha, and looked helplessly and bowed down to it and said, "Okay." , not for example, come out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erha was connected with Su Ge's mind. After feeling the relief and smile of Su Ge's heart, he suddenly opened his mouth and put out his tongue. He drilled out under the punch of the fart, and threw himself into Su Ge's arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The death penalty is exempt, the living sin can't escape!" At this time, Su Ge suddenly grabbed the head of Erha and put his head in the middle and rubbed it with both hands. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raging the dog's head! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At six o'clock in the evening, Sug stood in the northeast of the city. A family building in front of the third floor of the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This building used to be a newspaper company. After the business was not closed down, it was transformed into an office building, and it is now rented out all the year round. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An hour ago, he was informed by Adeline that after the second dog’s head was finished, the only remaining one was worn out. The coat ran out and sat down with the last steam locomotive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall stood at the door at this time, with a peaceful smile on his handsome face, and a huge contrast with the eternal hesitation before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge walked over and said with a smile: "I have always felt that there is a fate between you and me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall is slightly covered and respected: "Thank you for guiding me to my Lord and let me hope for redemption."<br /><br />&nbsp Su Ge smiled: "The hope of redemption has always been grasped by myself. I stood in the hall at that time. Your performance, your piety made you get the thumbs up and praise you deserve. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can actually enter the hall!?" I heard that Randall was a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a point of respect for this seemingly young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are the four crazy people?" Sugue asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall said, "I am here, waiting for your decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
