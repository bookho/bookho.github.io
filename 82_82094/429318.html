			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell to Emilia, walk out of the Basilica of the Holy Blood, and Su Ge looks at the library of the Holy Blood in the distance, and his complexion is somewhat complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a regional bishop, he still does not know exactly what secrets are in the Holy Blood Library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sanctuary Library of Guinness is fully assembled and airborne by airship! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why the St. Xue Library has such a strong form, Emilia just said a deep meaning: "This is the shelter of the goddess." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"French Water..." Sugg recalled that there were no wheelchairs in his legs, and his heart was suddenly very curious about this old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out the pocket watch, it’s already a little faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First eat lunch, go to Evan in the afternoon to see the situation there." Su Ge licked his stomach and turned to the canteen of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At three o'clock in the afternoon, Su Ge returned to Bain University to find Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the university, the university was suspended. But the focus of the students does not seem to be on the mysterious event. Most people are discussing the legendary bishop of Su Ge, and some people are weird and seem to be talking about a game that has just finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The game? What game?" Su Ge puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Su Ge’s incomprehensibility was answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the independent apartment of Niya, he saw the red-faced, energetic Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, he thought of the game that the students had just said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avon turned around at this moment and said with excitement: "Suge, my life! I have never been so happy in my life! You said That's right, it's just awesome to just let people know the true meaning of human nature, just seeing Mike's distorted face that doesn't dare to attack!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge turned his head and asked to look down at the drawing Niya: "Two young men have already won the game?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niya looked up and said: "Well. After you left, I asked Evan to draw some drawings and talk about the whole process of improving R&D. After a while, Mike Road came to visit me with a gift. Just happened, I took them both to the school. Mechanical R&D room. Just as the whole school was closed, I called the principals, their instructors, professors, and related students to conduct an open live debate, theoretical reasoning and practice proof. In this sudden situation It must be that the original version of the person can be more confident, and the result is not bad with my imagination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge brain to make up, suddenly thought of that The purple face and the distorted look of the aristocratic child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan clenched his fist: "It’s so happy! The guy still humiliated me at the beginning, mocking me, and the students below continue to insult me, 哼Oh, but in the process of debate and reasoning, he was suppressed by me, watching his face paler and paler, his forehead oozing sweat, and finally he was so angry that it was so cool!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good! Very good! Although I didn't see it, I can feel the dramatic scene at the time." Su Ge smiled happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niya sat down at this moment: "The principal and his mentor have just announced this matter in person and have made the whole thing clear. Now His mentor has been suspended from office, and his reputation and everything that belongs to him has been brought back. Mike Road and the entire road family have been discredited and allowed me to join the blacklist of the neat union for five years." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s face nodded with satisfaction: “This is the best.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some, the power of the road family is very big after all, if you want to use the means in secret, it is still very dangerous." Niya has seen more things, reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly and turned to Evan and said, "Don't worry, I will let someone protect you in these few days."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heard this, Evan sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evan, you should avoid it first, I have something to say to Bishop Sotos." Niya said at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan is now very respectful to Niya, smiling at Sug and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked relaxed and relaxed, and Niya seriously asked: "Bishop Sotos, just the incident, is related to the witch?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There should be, but you should not intervene in this matter, it is very dangerous." Su Ge warned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niya snorted, she knew her ability, she couldn’t get into this kind of thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The recent Bain City will be chaotic, it is not safe, if you want, you can live in the Cathedral of the Holy Blood." Su Ge suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niya shook his head: "Thank you for your kindness, but the female warlock lived in the Cathedral of the Holy Blood, how it feels very uncomfortable. In fact, almost no one knows My identity as a mystery person, it should be safe to live here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge thought, did not force: "OK, if you have any problems, feel free to contact me." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then chatted again, and Su Ge and Evan bid farewell to Niya and leave Bain University. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the road family is located in the manor in the southeast of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want him to die! That untouchable! I want him to die!" The handsome and handsome Mike Road on weekdays was stunned, his hair was messy and he was crazy. The same squatting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his father, Ligon Road, already knew the news and the relevant punishments of Niya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a bishop in the field, is it a bit of a deception?" Ligan listened to the princess's trembling remarks, his face sullen to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther immediately nodded: "Yes right! It’s too arrogant, their hands are too long!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father! I want him to die!" Mike looked awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ligen is still very calm at this time: "The conventional means are not working now, and the young bishop will definitely send someone to protect the family."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?" Mike asked hoarsely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ligan did not continue to say, turned to Luther and said: "You need to maintain this thing first. After the bishop has gone, I have many ways. Let's calm down this matter, go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther feels relieved and quickly leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Luther left. Ligan looked at his son with a distressed look and said with concern: "We still have unconventional means, children. Just when your uncle Burke Tom is back, he will have a way."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, McDonald was excited and licked his lips: "The people, I want you to die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The voice just fell, and a middle-aged man wearing a black suit and goatee suddenly appeared next to the two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged person is about one meter seven, and his body shape is fairly well-proportioned. Some bald, triangular eyes and round faces give a very uncomfortable feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My dear nephew, your hate and perseverance are so rare. If you live up to this desire, I will not be willing to go." The middle-aged man made some greasy sounds, giving people an unspeakable discomfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle Burke!" Seeing this middle-aged man, Mike Wan saw the savior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Burke Tom is the mysterious person his father knew when he was young. He was seriously injured at the time, he was saved by the help of Ligan, and then the two became good friends. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious profession is a thief. He helped Ligan secretly remove a lot of competitors, including his own brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He developed a bottleneck in the past few years and left here to travel to the capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two days said that they have already achieved a career and come back for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berke said faintly: "I have known the situation, but it is an ordinary person sheltered by a self-righteous young bishop."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does the bishop need to deal with it?" Ligan tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birk sneered: "A young man who has just entered the mystery. The so-called mystery is a profession that has accumulated over time. This kid can One year's time has come to this step, and it has nothing to do with merit and strength. It is estimated that it is the illegitimate son of the archbishop. I have seen more of this kind of thing, but it is a waste of sudden success. It is not enough."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the father and son suddenly felt relieved, and Mike hurriedly asked: "Uncle Burke, what should we do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are many ways to kill without a trace, it depends on how you want him to die." Burke touched his beard and looked confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike said: "I want to let him die in the most miserable way. I want him to kill his own family. After recovering consciousness, he will die and die." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burke listened and opened his mouth and patted Mike's shoulder: "Mike, this idea is very good. If that's the case, let's get started." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do I need to prepare?" Ligen asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some related mysterious materials, I will list the list, but also the thing that the Evans have used, if there is related body organization, such as A hair, a drop of blood would be better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike said: "This is simple!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sent Evan home, when Sugi suddenly thought of something when they said goodbye, casually said: "Yes Just in case you have been following me for the past two days, take a trip to the mysterious gathering you went to tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ewen’s heart is warm Nod: "Okay, I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the farewell, Su Ge stood at the crossroads of the street, watching the vehicles and pedestrians in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he thought of the bodies of the three physically fragmented students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
