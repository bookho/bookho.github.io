			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tulip Apartment 422 room, living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline used mysterious means to close the entire room, ensuring that five people would sit around without being eavesdropped by anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sat down and looked positive: "Our evening church is officially established today, our creed, our guidelines are very clear to you. However, due to the special nature of our personnel, we can only operate in secret at this stage, absorbing those poor people who are eager to seek asylum."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other four nodded, Express understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, our current group is witches, female warlocks, vampires, undead people, etc. These are the worldly disgusted heretics, and they must be mentally stable, Those who yearn for peace. We will not contain and protect those who are eager to do things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge nodded with satisfaction, watching Randall ask: "You said something and said to me, let's talk now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall straightened his body and said: "The Pope, I hope to give me some time for me to return to my hometown, the land of night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Oh? Do you have any thoughts?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall nodded: "My people are still suffering from the erosion of blood, I want to go back and lead them to join our church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Randall explained: "I didn't come out for the Holy Grail this time. I just wanted to find a way to free me from the blood curse." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge contemplates the darkness: "Randall is very powerful now, and in the future my core place is in the church, he is not very useful. And Now the core enemy, the powerful black man, they are not opponents. It doesn't mean much to stay here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge nodded and said: "Yes, but after you go back, you need to help me to understand in detail the situation of the night scene and the relevant materials related to the Institute of Polar Studies. It is a place that the three churches cannot cover, which is very conducive to our development. I will pass The messenger of my Lord is always available to ask you about the situation there. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Randall nodded hard after listening: "No problem, the Pope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the title has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall finished, Adeline followed: "The Pope, I also need to leave for a while. First of all, I want to bring this thing to the women." The Warlock Sisters will report, and then I will go to Gerlos to explain this matter in detail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Suggton nodded happily:" No problem, just you need to help me determine the nature of the Women's Sorcerer's Sisters, and temporarily serve as a link between me and the Jelos Masters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusas is now The central archbishop, such a huge assistant, Su Ge, naturally will not be left unused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My next long time will be to learn about the church and familiarize yourself with the world in the church, so the timing of separation is very good now. I will contact you through the messenger of my Lord and let go, do not have any scruples, the glory of my Lord will shelter us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rand And Adeline nodded and suddenly jumped in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word "this world?" was noticed by two people at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you say..." Suddenly, two people thought of a possibility, the spirit is as shaking as the electric shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not notice the anomalies of these two old monsters, and looked at the words and stops, said: "Do you have any questions? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outward-looking Hills directly said: "The Pope, I hope to follow Mr. Randall to the night."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills has a firm face, right color: "This time let We feel urgent and shy, I want to grow up quickly and become stronger. I listen to Mr. Randall saying that the night is completely different from here. It is a chaotic and dangerous place. That is exactly the case, I want to go there to temper my skills and abilities. I don't want to let my Lord's glory be dusty the next time my Lord needs me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side, Bernice followed and said, "I think so too, but I hope to follow Ms. Adeline to the capital. I am more suitable to grow in that place. The development of the church in the future will definitely require a lot of relationships and funds. Our network of relationships plays a vital role in spreading the glory of our Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge’s heart glimpsed, and then filled with relief . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two timid little girls finally grew up completely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge did not rush to answer, turned to Randall and Adeline: "What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall replied: "Hill Sis has a very high level of combat talent. If you have been here, it is really wasteful. If you go back to the night, I can try my best to train her!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Adeline is equally solemn: "Bennis is very sensitive to politics and sensitivity. She is a nobleman, has extensive knowledge and has given me a certain amount of time. I and Bernice can definitely build a wide range. Strong network."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening, Su Ge looked at the four corners of his mouth and slowly lifted his hands, raising his hands and whispering: "Good! Very good! Very, very good! Your vision, this heartfelt loyalty and considerations will be very very satisfying, go! Let's grow hard! Efforts to develop! In the future, spread the brilliance of my Lord to every corner of the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! His Majesty the Pope!" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Su Ge did not say too much, after all, even if it is separated, you can communicate at any time in your dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people are ready to leave the day after tomorrow, after all, it doesn’t make sense to stay here today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has no opinion, and decides to leave home directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After home, Ada is back and is preparing dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Ada saw Su Ge’s clothes, he hurriedly stepped forward and confirmed the more delicate goddess pendant on the chest. I am happy to ask: "Are you a clergyman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
