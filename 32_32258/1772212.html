			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless pieces of bloody flowers mixed with the skin fragments on the back like a fireworks that instantly fill the person's surroundings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the role of the fireball that caused him to suddenly rise. The body of the man who fired on his back also showed a violent explosion. The impact only changed his physical position and did not actually cause any harm to him. It’s all because of the arrow that passed under him and behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrow itself has two or three meters away from him. The white light around the arrow is just the body that just wiped his back and could not be hurt by the explosion. The huge roar of the white skies collapsed like a shard of fluff. If the person's position is further increased by an inch by the next inch or the trajectory of the arrow, then the whole person will be smashed like a two-legged dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s just that one inch of this person is just hurt and not dead. And this time he succeeded in dodging instead of parry, so he still left the spare. This moment of active and passive relationship has been completely reversed. A green fireball instantly formed in his hands toward the exiled shrine knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilska was not panicked under extreme shock, although he was exhausted because of the full force of the arrow, but it was only him and he was under his seat. The griffin did not. The height of this fireball is fast enough, but at least it is much slower than the arrow he shot. This is a distance of more than 100 meters. He grabbed his lion's legs and encouraged his wings to hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the gryphon just moved his wings, the hands of the man actually appeared two green fireballs at the same time. He shouted and waved the two fireballs and took off his hand to Wellske. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the fireball is such a low-level magic, the three-in-one is difficult to complete even the division, but this is not the most amazing place for the Knights of the Temple. He was surprised that the green fireballs in the two places did not come straight to him but instead made an arc in the air. Shooting at him from two different angles. This is exactly the same way as the curved trajectory arrow he just shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two fireballs are violently rotating with high rotation and the strength of the shot makes the sphere show a slightly curved air around the squad. . Although this is pure magic. The above is not as attached to the Welsh Kay arrow, but the arc caused by the rotation of the sphere itself is far more perfect than the arrow just now. The opposite angles of the two fireball hearts fly toward the same point and this point is also the position of the griffin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilska has to admit that this is indeed a tricky opponent. This is the first-class level of tactics or skills, but you can use your own strength to push yourself to such an almost desperate situation. He can't shoot the devil's arrow again to resist the green fireball, no matter the body's vindictiveness or muscle strength, so that the fireball that hits the left and right will suddenly become dodge in this movement unless he is riding a griffin instead of flies. . So he can't hide. It is also impossible to resist the only thing that can be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judgment of the Knights of the Temple and the determination of the decision made Wilsons from the surprise to the judgment of the situation until the end of the run but only spent a blink of an eye, but this is his Turning down from the back of the lion's cub, but only two or five meters of the two fireballs fell on the gryphon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a muffled sound. The lion's screams didn't come out and the huge body was melted and melted in the green flame like a wax. The green flame and the corpse smell of the Necromancer spread like a wave of waves, which spread faster than the fall of the Knights of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilska sighed and raised his left arm with a sacred guardian shield. Although he can't control the guardian shield to protect himself and the gryphon, he can only protect himself from the top. That layer of crystal white light shield appeared in time. Can withstand the green flame that is flying down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the whole person’s arrow shot just in the place where the line of sight was almost out of sight finally hit the trees below the numerous trees like a sickle. Weeds break like a weed. This arrow actually plowed a trajectory in the trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feathers attached to the glory of the battle, Wellske looked at the opponent who fell like himself 100 meters away and can see that he is also Looking at his own eyes is a kind of fierceness that is about to hunt for prey. Then the man took out the magic scroll from his arms and unfolded a white thunderball and rushed to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gryphon knights in the middle and lower bangs couldn't help but look up and look at the air. They just saw that Wiske was so far as to be able to fly out in the sudden explosion of electric light and air waves. A lot of blood spewed out from the mouth of the Knights of the Temple, and the green flames sprinkled like a scattered fireworks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body flew out like a cannonball. Wellskey only felt that the skeletal muscles on his back had all been mixed into a heart, the liver and the spleen and lungs seemed to be a brain The blood rushed out of the throat together. But he himself understands that he is only hurt and hurts very much but will not die. If there is any armor in the world that can defend against such high-level magical attacks, then this kind of magical armor with the Holy Power. The armor on his back was only concave and not broken under such a huge impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Wellscay knew he had lost. Such a wound is allowed to be treated with the brilliance of the armor. He is also unable to pull the golden war bow again. Even this explosion explodes him hundreds of meters away. He doesn't know if he still has the ability to stand up and get there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion’s sorrow in the trees over there is constantly ringing. Suddenly in a farther place. One is not lost to the huge tragedy of the thunderball explosion just now, but like the tsunami, all the sounds in the forest are drowned. Dashed away. Just by the volume, you can hear that this huge roar is not out of the human mouth. The listener can feel the pain and anger contained in this voice. More is just bloodthirsty violent and wild animal nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was only one sound of gold and iron screaming in this snoring and then there was an object that broke through the trees and flew into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilska is far from there but only his eyesight can see that the flying midair is a huge gun. The gun body was covered with huge impacts and the marks left by the chopping, and even the shape of the gun was completely distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wellske certainly knows who the gun is and is vaguely aware of what it means to fly this air in the air. Anxious anger and sadness rushed into the heart like a tide. At this time, he fell on the trunk of a big tree and stepped on the real thing. A sudden burst of blood rushed from the throat uncontrollably. The consciousness was also chaotic and faint. He rolled over and fell off the branches and fell to the ground. Nothing is known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took for Wellskai to slowly recover consciousness and open his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the scene is a dimly lit fire swaying to illuminate the huge gryphon on the tent. It’s already night and it seems to be a handsome account in the Eliasian army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult. You woke up." Next to a voice, Wellske looked around with a hard look at the young Templar Jawi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adriatic?" asked Willske. The painful heartache on the back made him understand that this is not a dream or a paradise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javier shook his head and sighed and said: "I’m sorry that we arrived. It’s already late... The body of Adriatic’s body has been sent back. It’s just shining. The armor has been taken away by the group of orcs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilska feels that anger and sorrow seem to be a red-hot sword running through him. The body can feel the sharp and hot pain in every muscle and bone. His body and expression can't help but twitching out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javier silenced and continued: "The news of the troops of the Kingdom of Judah in the north just came... Christine and Jenny are also killed... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Wellske bounced off the bed but then fell down and put on the bandages constantly oozing blood. The weakness and pain of the body, he has completely felt that he still wants to struggle to climb up the face of the muscles and facial features have been out of control distortion. "How can this be what is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two of them were also lured by the orcs, and each team took a small team and attacked them... But there was an ambush. According to the people who fled back, the man who killed the Kristen was just a bare-handed man. It must be Gru. There is no life in Baizhen’s division but there are countless magic explosions left on the battlefield. The traces may be Cedros."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are nearly a thousand miles away from Oufu, how can they both run alone to the coalition as the leader of Oufu? Come to the army?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that as you expected, we are really too big." Wellskai sighed and closed his eyes. Extreme anger and sorrow were finally borne by his steely will and nerves, but in exchange for a sense of powerlessness and exhaustion. "Even the Pope and the Lancelot are deliberately swearing at us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young Templar has no slight fluctuations on his face. No worries. Just nodded and said faintly: "Oufu's strategy of showing the enemy's weakness before it was considered that several adults were not affected but the coalition forces were confused. At the time of the low morale, the attack of several adults was actually a last resort. But... a few adults are really a bit of a big idea. If a few people can carry a few top magic scrolls on each person... maybe the situation will be better..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Wilska is silent. Suddenly sighed: "It is true that we are careless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the top magic scroll is a valuable item in ordinary warriors or magicians. For Leicester, it is not a narrative. But almost every Knight of the Temple will not wear these things on his body. Each of them relied on their own martial arts and actual combat to board the polar position of this warrior. And you need to bring the magic scroll magic props to the body at any time. Only the newly-debuted newcomers like Talis have their behaviors in their eyes and even look like children's ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at the end of the day, it is the sadness of their self-esteem. If in the sky he can have the same magic scroll as the pair, he will win. The thunderbolt in the magic scrolls stored in the Glorious Castle can only be considered a relatively low-grade thing. And if Edrick can carry a magic scroll with him... Wellskey feels that he has twitched in his chest and didn't think about it anymore. Because it is also awkward to think again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javier said: "I have submitted a report to His Majesty the Pope and Lancelot. This loss is too big for us. I suggest... transfer all command of the troops to the generals of the countries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" asked Willske. "They lead the country's own army and the enemy's heart is too heavy. Once they let them act alone, they will surely go straight into their own battles. Give Oufu a chance."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This loss reflects a major strategic disadvantage. The chaos of command is the result of this. And our understanding of Oufu is too little because it is completely there. We can't put a spy on it, so we can almost say nothing about them. According to the report, Gru killed King Kristen and left with a transfer reel. The surviving Griffin Knight here also saw Adrick. The blue light of the reel has been seen near the location where the adults died. It may be that Oufu has established his own transmission magic array. After all, they are very close to the Sandefies. It is convenient to get the eye of the star and the star. Fragments."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What you don't know is their combat power and tactics that can be used. For example, a two-legged dragon can be like a dwarf-made brake. such The gryphon is completely suppressed from a long distance. The combat methods of the orcs are different from those of the individual. The combat methods and conventional forces are different. Oufu’s more tactical and strategist. All previous combat experience may not be used. Becoming a paradox in thinking. So if we want to win, we must at least try to let Oufu expose the combat capabilities of our combat methods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You put The intention of returning command to them is to want them to temper?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not just like this. The death of the three adults has already made us in the coalition. The prestige has dropped to the lowest point. The next command will only be more difficult and it will be more difficult to let the commander do not let it act on its own. When they have enough pain, Oufu is not so good in their imagination. It’s more convenient for us to come back again.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “A lot of suffering? How much suffering? 30,000 soldiers killed? Or 50,000 soldiers?” Wellske Jarvis warrior with his eyes though frail but still sharp. "Would you like to let tens of thousands of soldiers who had been fighting for the glory of the Lord to die? Just to test?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since it is a war, there will be undead." And in my opinion, this is indeed the most effective way now." The young templar quietly answered his face as calm as a sculpture under the dark fire. "Adults, you are assured that the coalition forces are also full of battles. And after all, the coalition forces are a total of 100,000 troops. After all, there are only a few thousand people, so no matter how the loss will not be completely ruined. After these failures, their impetuous atmosphere. The enemy's heart will converge to truly follow the command of Celeste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
