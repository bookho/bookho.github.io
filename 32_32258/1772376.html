			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grou shot. The hands of the two-handed section of the finger slenderness Lancelot even with the sword made of white rainbow once fell into this hand immediately became a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of weapon is the kind of weapon that can't break through this kind of person. The hands themselves are already the most horrible weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呛朗剑碎. After all, this is the squeeze of the long sword that can be picked up by the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fragments of the sword are scattered down but Gru’s chest has already opened a large red blood flower and not only the chest, but also the entire upper body. The wound is spurting out of the sculptural body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword really stopped at the palm of Gru but the sword and the sword did not. The spirit of his instincts that has been stretched like a bowstring has been released. Even if the body can react, the spiritual will has been dissipated. Although Lancelot was also affected by his imposing swordsmanship, he was still there. If it is the body of another person, if the sword is not broken, the spilled sword and sword will be able to cut any body into a pile of pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German groaned his palm was loose and then the handle of Lancelot's sword was poked on his chest. A bang of Gru flew out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stab in his chest was just a bladeless, bare blade, but the hilt did not penetrate his body but appeared on his back. A huge sword blood red sword. The sword sword has already penetrated him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood not only rushed out of his body and back, but also spit out from his mouth and scattered along him in the air. tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Win? Lancelot squatted in the spot and looked at Gru by his own sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swords and swords and swords are not entities but far more harmful than entities. When the chest suffered such a sword. No one can afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Lancelot didn’t feel the joy of victory. But he turned and came over and shouted: "Who is it indiscriminately?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no response to the sneak attack of the cardinal and the body did not even leave . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really won. After Glue flew for dozens of meters, the swordsman who had passed through the ground plowed a deep trench on the ground. He could not stand up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can stand up and stand up in a situation where there is so much blood loss. Even if he is already the 6 strongest person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot who knocked down the big 6 strongest man with a sword now only feels emptiness and loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of that paralysis is not just that Gru is in it. It’s not that the sudden stagnation of Gru as the Cardinals imagined would give Lancelot a perfect opportunity. The spirit of confrontation between the two is working together as if they were two of each other. One of them is suddenly losing strength because of external forces and the other is losing balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sword is actually just because it is not perfect to detect the rush of the opponent. Not to mention that it is a full blow. But it was such a sloppy sword that knocked down the one who gambled on all the souls and spirits to overcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General Gru..." I don’t know if the orc who saw this scene made a scream and all the orcs looked at it and stayed there. The god of war in their minds has now been knocked down. All the orcs who can pull out are all coming to the grounds of Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beasts are already at a disadvantage under the huge difference in numbers, and they are beginning to show signs of defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original should have taken this opportunity to rush to the past. Gru has been turned down. No one can be his opponent, but Lancelot sighs in sigh. Turned to the direction of the Guangming Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also in the direction of the Guangming Hall, it was Inham who was chasing behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
