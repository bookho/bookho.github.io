			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the cathedral of the School of Magic. Asa never came in. He rarely came close to this majestic building. A serious and solemn sect made him uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in this tall building, you can fully appreciate the special power of religion. Even if he never believed in any god, he felt the awe-inspiring solemnity in the surrounding environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tens of meters high roof and huge interior give a broad, far-reaching and grand feeling that the sun is transmitted from the surrounding and the top of the stained glass into a mist The light and shadow in the space swaying on the walls of the magnificent murals show the majesty and embarrassment of God. The organ of the organ is permeated in the air and it is impossible to tell where this hoarse and heavy tone comes from. It seems that this is the property of a sound that surrounds the dignified environment. It is an illusion that naturally arises from this convincing atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is very skeptical that the two pastors who led the way have been specially trained in this area. They walked in this solemn environment but did not have the sound as if they were used to There is only one footstep in the surrounding momentum, and the small and lonely resounding in this empty room seems to be the same as the majesty around. Asa has the feeling that she has been shocked by the majesty of this dignified environment as if she is a trivial existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two pastors took him through the worship hall and walked into a long corridor. At the end of the corridor, the priest opened the door and said respectfully: "The bishop has already brought it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a small room The books around the two chairs are all bookshelves. Compared with the grandeur of the church outside, it is as simple and neat as it is a little isolated. Only when the wall is high, there are several windows that open into the light. Bishop Dr. Ronis is sitting next to the bookshelf. He put the book in the book back on the bookshelf and nodded to the two pastors. "Okay. Go back. Keep the door closed and remember not to let other people in."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The two pastors quit and closed the door. All the sounds and atmosphere outside were suddenly cut off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assad was a little nervous at the door. He knew that the people in front of the whole empire were worshipping people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't sit nervously." Bishop Ronis smiled at him very nicely and pointed to the chair. His pure white silk gown and thin face look like a reclusive hermit and the simplicity of the surrounding is not the slightest pressure. Asa was a little bit safe and sat down. He did not know that if the bishop was standing and talking to people in accordance with etiquette, only the emperor was qualified to sit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my specially built room" Bishop Ronis pointed to the walls around. "There are people who are completely outside and outside the soundproof. I can't see those rituals when I have only two people. I still prefer to talk without any ceremonies. If too many people often I will only pay attention to the rules and forget what I really want to do." His expression is very easy to follow and the tone is neither high nor arrogant nor a little charity. This kind of arbitrarily gracefulness and his superb status are more likely to give birth to inner conviction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you got a leaf of the world tree?" Bishop Roones picked up the pot on the small table and poured a cup of tea in a very casual tone. Just like asking if people bought a green vegetable. "And then you took it to save someone?" Sandro's tone seemed quite fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nodded and said, "Yes." In the heart, although he is sure that the bishop will not sneer at him like Sand, but it is also very Reluctantly such a respectable old man blames himself. Fortunately, Bishop Ronis just shook his head and smiled as if with a little appreciation, he said: "I can see that you are a very kind person." Bishop Rooney handed the cup in his hand to Asa. "How about this tea, I am soaked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa took a sip and said, "I don't know if I don't drink this tea, I just think Very bitter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Rooney said with a smile: "I heard that in some countries, making tea is an art. I can also get a deep and profound in this respect." It’s a very laid-back country.” He sat down in a chair next to Asa. "Well, let me talk about how you got the leaf of the world tree. To be specific, I believe this will be a wonderful story." He smiled and looked forward to seeing it as if he was just waiting. Listen to a good story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa began to repeat what he had encountered from meeting the red robe. Of course, he omitted the key points of how he hijacked the imperial minister and the local official. As for the elf elder Kran's words to him, because he did not care at all and did not care about the elves' old-fashioned stagnation, they thought that it was simply their own nonsense, so they even forgot about it. It’s just that the elves simply don’t allow him to go out of the forest because of their strange old legends and rules. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Bishop Rooney did not care about him as if he was interested in the things about the red robe and asked every detail from time to time. His expression was slightly smiling, and he smiled more deeply. He nodded and took a deep breath with a bitter smile. The skinny face is very vivid, but I don’t know if it is the illusion of his identity. Or does he have such temperament, whether it is peace or smile, it will not give people the feeling of being close to each other. The majesty of distinction is in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Asa’s remarks, he took back his eyes and looked at the opposite bookshelf as if he wanted to reorganize what he had just heard in his mind. . Asa did not dare to interrupt and just looked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Bishop Ronis retracted his eyes and asked Asa: "Have you heard of the Necromancer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nodded. Almost no one has ever heard of this name. It is in the valley of the Big 6, the most southern part of the valley called Demi, who is composed of black magicians who believe in death. It is said that they can eat human blood and drink blood to manipulate zombies and ghosts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magician you met earlier in the whispering sorcerer is the mortal guild."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nodded and he probably guessed it early in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sandru is also a member of the Necromancer Association at least a long time ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ah?" Asa was very surprised. It was really difficult for him to live with himself for so long. The old man who went to the streets every day to go shopping and the legendary terror monsters who eat human flesh and blood. I did not expect it to be completely unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For a long time, because of the lack of a true sense of the relationship between them, they gradually became a relatively loose magician organization, and there is a mountain that completely separates them from them. Drew is like that. But there are always a small number of people who are determined to let the darkness and death cover the world. Over the years they have been secretly active in the empire to constantly confuse people to establish a pagan organization to divide and shake the people's faith. The destruction is the most dangerous. Once the faith collapses, the whole country will also go out of control. In history, the wars and tragedies caused by the madness of faith are numerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Do you know what book you borrowed from the daughter of the Duke of Mulak?" Bishop Ronis suddenly pulled the subject to the question that Asa was worried about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know." Asa now has some guilty conscience as a child who has done something wrong and waits for the adult to judge. Unknowingly, he was completely convinced by the intimate austerity of Bishop Ronis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the note left by the founder of the Necromancer Association, Akibad. It uses ancient words to record all kinds of magical things that he knows. The key point is that it also records a dark meditation that is said to have been created for the leadership of the Necromancer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa swallowed his forehead There was a cold sweat on it. Bishop Ronis did not pay attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fortunately, no one has been able to practice this kind of meditation for hundreds of years. Most people who dare to practice will be halfway through. Was killed by the magical power of the darkness of the heart. Shandrew stole the book twenty years ago. I originally suggested to Sandru to destroy it, but Sandru was stubborn to say that it was a great I didn’t want to force him, so I stayed. Sandru told me that he was in a very secret and safe place, so I didn’t worry that I just didn’t expect you to find it and you didn’t know it. I borrowed it again. I was worried about the dark magician you said in the mouth to take the leaves of the world tree. If he wanted to use the vitality to neutralize the dark magic in meditation, this thing fell again. In their hands, the result may be that they will really create a king of the dead. At that time, not only the empire but the whole world will be swallowed up by the darkness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This time Asa did not meditate on my ass. This thing involves itself and is also related to the bishop and Sandru. He respects the bishop and does not want to blame Shandru's skunk, not to mention that this incident is indeed caused by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
