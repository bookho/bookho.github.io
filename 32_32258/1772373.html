			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one in the world can really count. Reality is not a novel. Compared to the complicated world, people are actually just the gods of this world. The ants can master everything that changes everything is the spirit of all things. However, they are all slang words of ignorance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Hamm has understood this truth since long ago. But when he saw the distorted steel prison, there was a short gap in his mind that was completely overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is really smart enough and his smartest place is not to think that his intelligence can be invincible in the world, so everything is very cautious and never obscured by himself. What to ask for. So all of his plans have been able to be carried out almost seamlessly, and everything he expected was implemented step by step according to his wishes. So even if he already understood the truth, he had an illusion that everything was really in his arrangement. However, it is impossible for him to calculate the trajectory of the meteor fire and the occlusion efficiency. There were only a few fireballs that had fallen through the slashing of the Great Sword and broke into the Glorious Castle. One of these few happened to be in the steel prison where Asa was being held. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manpower has no way to destroy the particularly hardened steel prisoners but in the face of the impact of a hundreds of thousands of pounds of hot meteors is also much stronger than ordinary houses Now the anti-magic magic array on the edge of the huge crater is just a group of rotten paper-like iron pieces that have been completely unrecognizable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Hamm looked at the scrap iron in the group and looked at it. It turned out to be ugly like never before. He stayed for a while and then snorted. Turned and flew to the central square where the killing voice was the heaviest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Mei has had enough mental preparation before using the transfer reel, but she almost scared when the magic blue light was scattered. Ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge white light curtain wraps the transmission magic array and Aymy, who just sent it, is also in the meantime. Now her ears are screaming and screaming at the sound of screaming weapons. There are hundreds of faces in the face. Orcs like evil spirits frantically waved weapons around the light curtain to hit the light curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full and bloody werewolf leaped high. But hitting the white light curtain, the body shape was actually embedded in the light curtain. A templar was flying and a sword cut the wolf man from head to toe into two pieces of blood and internal organs. But as soon as Jiang went to the light curtain, it immediately bounced back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light and the protection of the ruins of the werewolf's body are under the protection of the light curtain... Ai Mei only feels that his stomach is twitching and wowing on the ground . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Ai Mei, there are more than 20 people wrapped in the light curtain. If they are dressed up, they are all high-level clerics. Except for the four cardinals and the two high-ranking Templars, all of them are also bishops. These are the bishops and priests in the parishes of the various parishes who received the alarming magic bell and then used the transfer reel directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle of the orcs is just a venting battle that has been stunned by violent anger and no one has deliberately destroyed the magical array. When there are a few wakeful ups At that time, several bishops have been sent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white magic of these bishops is superb and profound, but it is impossible to resist the heavy weapons of the orcs in this melee. Finally, relying on the rapids of the air, the Purdue of the public, the light rain only barely supported it. The orcs who are gradually waking up more and more are gradually sending dozens of orcs who are surrounded by magical arrays. Fortunately, just a few cardinals transmitted and immediately joined forces to unfold this layer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This white magic shield looks like a layer of translucent light curtain but can't be broken no matter how the orcs outside attack. Only as the orcs attacked and collided with several forces to maintain the shield, the face of the cardinal began to gradually white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me quickly." A bishop shouted at Ayimei. Nowadays, it is natural to be a companion in this transmission magic array. Although it is not a reason why it is a little girl, it is clear that this is a magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ayimei heard this but did not react at all. Her mind is also in the same way as the stomach. These seemingly familiar scenes overlap in the mind to stir up extreme fear and nausea and headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Deng Deng Deng Deng’ Two wild cows rushed toward the light curtain with the rumbling rumbling sound of the half-orc. As long as they let them hit, it is not necessary to say that the defense of this light curtain can not withstand the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The gods are like the prison gods like the sea." The two cardinals in the light curtain also used paralysis. The two bulls instantly became the clay-carved wood-like, completely static and immobile inertia. The half-orc riding on it flew straight over the white magic light curtain. The white light curtain that lost the magic support of the two cardinals began to fluctuate. Other orcs attacked and waved on the top as if they had thrown stones in the pond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't hold it anymore." Someone is yelling at a few red cardinals. They never thought that Celeste had just ringed the enemy and they had already attacked the central square. Although they were all high white magicians, white magic was useless in the face of the hundreds of orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that no one thought that the cardinals would send them through the transfer magic array. There are also many swordsmen outside the square who want to rush here. They can't get over it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original neat and magnificent central square next to the transfer magic array is now in ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot also has two Knights of the Templars to play against Gru. Only the four people collided with each other to fight the fighting and the airflow created in the center of the square opened up a circle of 100 meters only belongs to the battlefield of these four people. No one else can get involved in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot moved for the dazzling squad of three white light shadows surrounded by various auxiliary magic. Every time there is a continuous impact, the intersection of each other will have an earth-shattering loud noise. From time to time, there will be a statue of the Knights of the Temple flying in the ping-pong bang, but it will not take long to re-fly back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot and the two swordsmen’s swords on the ground are dazzling. All the vindictiveness and magic are gathered on the sword and Gru is still bare-handed. He still uses his fist to go straight to the hard. It’s just that he’s all the wounds on his body, although the scars are not deep, but the red blood has already stained his whole body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two Temple Knights are all desperately attacking. Almost every time, at the cost of a punch, I put a sword on it. As long as the fist is not the head, no matter how heavy the injury is, it can be recovered in the light rain all over the sky, even in Gru. Immediately under the boxing, the distorted and distorted brilliance of the armor was restored to the original state in the Purdue beings with the injury on the **. The light rain within 100 meters of this circle seems to be attracted by the shining armor of the two Knights of the Temple, no longer falling slowly but directly pouring into their bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot did not attack with the two men. He is still steady and steady. Responsible for defending Gru's attack to create opportunities for two Knights of the Temple to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually not the three people in the attack on Gru. But four people. Half of the role of the Purdue beings used by the Pope before the Pope was used was on this battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people’s attacks have completely suppressed the Beast, but the more they suppress them, the more amazing they are. The potential of this opponent's potential is great. The more amazing the endurance, the more it suppresses the counterattack power and the amazing momentum and the murderousness, but the more and more prosperous. They even feel that they are attacking with all their strength. It is a huge volcano. If you can't completely crush it, it will be blown up into pieces and burned to ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t even dare to give up the slightest thoughts as long as the pressure is reduced a little. The pressure that accumulates is likely to burst out and tear them apart. Not only can we not relax, but we must do our best as soon as possible. Because when the light and rain of the people of Pudu are stopped, they will never have any capital to suppress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru’s nephew is still dark but his eyes are completely red. It’s being killed and fighting in the depths of the soul. The color of the instinct that I don't know is even a little bit of his original white and dazzling vindictiveness. His mind has fallen into a hearty pleasure. All the mind and body spirits of the fighting spirit have been completely burned, which is more fun than when fighting in Llanslot in Tula. Even when the other's sword stabbed into his own body and cut off the flesh and cut off the blood vessels, it was not only painful but also painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angrily warfare kills painful intentions and there are countless turbulent emotions in his body, and there is something in the body that is being scrubbed by the waves in the deepest part of the body. The shock is tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
