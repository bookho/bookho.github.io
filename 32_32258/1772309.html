			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very similar room to Sandru’s former big house in Wangdu, just a little smaller and even darker. A variety of corpses, organs placed in the container, two huge stone platform in the center of the house, the air is filled with the smell of a body and antiseptic liquid. In addition, there is only a broken wooden bed in this room, as well as some simple living and supplies. Like Shanda’s big house, it’s not like a place to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the old man told them to come in, but in fact there seems to be no place to sit in the room, it seems that this does not seem to entertain the guests. And even if there is, it is possible that both Talis and Ayimei would not dare to sit down. Talis has a white magical light that illuminates. This place looks strange and knows that the other is a Necromancer. She does not feel the magic of sacred armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't use white magic here. I don't like that color." The old man blinked and seemed to be uncomfortable with the white light on Talis. After a stroke, the magic on Talis disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis’s face sank, but she did not act rashly. The old man did not use the purifying of white magic or any dispelling magic, but the necromantic magic forced her white magic shock to offset and did not prove that she had the slightest injury. This method is like a big axe to help people take off a layer of clothes. This control technique has been somewhat ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well....." The old man looked at Asa up and down, nodded, coughing. "You are the kid who has studied with Sander?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you have been many times, and finally saw it....." The old man coughed and gasped, as if muttering to himself. "Oh, the good thing about Shandru’s stinky boy... For the first time in five hundred years, outsiders have learned real meditation and learned the magic of the dead spirit.... Also messed up the Diya Valley... Forget it, it would have been chaotic... It’s coming, it’s coming....”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”Agrigenal let you come to me? Looking for me, what is this old man who is going to die?" The old man sat on a bed made of small planks, breathing like a broken bellows, and coughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My mother-in-law asked me to ask Mr. Shante to give us a way. Go to the underground road of Nigan," Asa said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Going to the underground of Nigan? The third road in the north is the largest road that leads directly to the deepest underground of Nigan, the tens of thousands of troops of Celeste more than a decade ago. I have been in. You naturally can also go." Shante old man coughed. Every time he talks, he is very hard. Listening to the local people is even more difficult, because it is necessary to put together the meaning of the words from more coughs. "The way we have to go is naturally the way the old gentleman is here." Asa looked at the shrinking cough in front of him. The old man, very respectfully said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sand looked at Asa with a glance, the turbid eyes were more turbid, and he said with a weak voice: "My road here is not for you, only Diya." The Valley Agents Association is qualified to go, and it is incumbent. Even the Agrirines do not work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know. The old gentleman keeps this According to the rules of the Diya Valley, only the agent president can go to the ground, but now our situation is urgent, and the old gentleman is also allowed to pass." Asa carefully took out the dark jewel from his arms and sent it. The old man of Shante. "When you look at this, you know that I am not talking nonsense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well?" Shant’s turbid eyes suddenly lit up. But then it went dark again. "This thing can't be out of me. I'm going to know that I haven't lost my job. I won't let you go this way. I know where you are going, I tell you the other way. I can get there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Being able to get there does not mean that I am going there. More than a decade ago, Lancelot led the twelve shrine knights. Didn't arrive, how could we three?" Asa took the gems back and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, you killed me, you can go." Shante suddenly coughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is not for Asa, but for Talis. The horsewoman seems to be a little impatient, although she knows that she can't do it, but she still has a murderous body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there are too many words to say. The cough of the mountain suddenly became intense. His thin body twitched violently with the cough, and a ugly face full of wrinkles rose red, and could not breathe but was breathing. Such an old man, whoever saw it, didn't feel that he needed to kill, just stand there and wait for a while. He himself will be coughed up by himself. "This grandfather is all right? I have some medicine at this time....." Ayimei couldn't help but ask. Although she knew that the old man in front of him was actually the legendary Necromancer, but the poor and poor appearance really made her unable to stand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis is still cold and her face is not moving, she knows that no matter how pitiful and thin, the old man is not something he can deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she didn’t move, Asa moved, and he suddenly stepped forward to hold the old man’s neck and the other on his chest. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His movements are fast, and there is no murder in advance. Even Talis and Ayimei were shocked by his actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man was very thin, Asa’s hand almost pinched his neck, his cough and twitching just stopped. Come down. The difference between the two human bodies and the appearance is like a wild wolf and a dying old chicken. Asa seems to be able to squeeze the old man who had been blown down by the wind as soon as he can. But just as Asa just snapped up the hill, the whole house moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accurately all the corpses in the whole house, the organs are moving, and they move fast. On the ground, on the cupboard, all the organs in the bottle are alive, and they are the kind of energy and mana that have been quietly alive for hundreds of years. They squat, jump, and rush to Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fastest move is the thing under the cloth in the big corner. Even when Asa’s hand had not been able to reach the mountain’s neck, the cloth was flying over the big piece of cloth, and the action was quick and even faster than Asa. From the outline of the cloth, it can be seen that it seems to be two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa moves, Talis is moving, and her long sword is squirting, the light of white magic is already shining on her body, sacred Blessings and Holy Armor are two auxiliary magical instants. She rushed to the two rags that were the fastest, and she could see that the following things were definitely the most threatening in the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis has a crystal triangle in one hand, the light of the white magic flashes, the crystal suddenly lights up, her movements and reflections It was indeed impeccable, but at this time, a drink of the card made her movements come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't move." This is Asa is drinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if this sentence is to Talise or to give him the mastery of the mountain. In short, the whole body and the corpse of the whole body are really alive. Stopped. Some of the organs that flew in the air, the limbs slammed into the ground. The two figures with cloths also stopped. The light in the triangular crystal on the hand of Talis is also extinguished immediately. Later, the light of the prism will be emitted. At such a distance, the fine internal organs can be completely made. Coke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Meimei reacted at this time, mourning the scriptures in a hurry, a circle of blue water curtains appeared in her and Talis’ body . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic fluctuations faintly spilled from Asa’s hands. This is a mixture of Necromancer magic and another magic that does not tell the unclear taste. From his hands, he rushed into the body of Shante and got into his thin body. And the body of the mountain also filled with a layer of black mist, the body of the entire house suddenly tasted dozens of times. That layer of fog is condensing<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This layer of mist is slowly flowing toward Asa and slowly immersed in his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One old and one small, two small ones are so motionless, only the magical force constantly flows between the two bodies. Talis and Ayi Mei are both unclear, so they look at the stalemate and are so eager to burn, but they don’t know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the fight, Asa took a long sigh of relief, his magical fluctuations between the two weakened and dissipated. The layer of fog around the body of the mountain was slowly weakened, and finally the two separated. At the same time, they are also relieved of Talis and Ayi Mei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
