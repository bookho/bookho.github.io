			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa pointed to the old pastor stuttering and asked: "You....you are not dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I am not dead when you die." The old pastor smothered Asa with his black and white eyes and spit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I.... I also said to avenge you..." Asa did not know whether his mood was shocking or happy. Although the appearance looks completely different, the tone and voice of the old pastor and the gesture of the gesture are the most important thing when he breaks into the wall and feels the special magical atmosphere. This old pastor is clearly Sandro. . As for the face, Asa knows that it is definitely a mask. This old man has always had a lot of tricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think you are so loyal. If you are killed in the future, I will give you a revenge." Shandrew smiled and reached out. A lifelike mask on his face reveals a familiar and strange face. In order to bring this mask, he had to get rid of his beard. After removing the beard, the wrinkles on his face were not very old. He shouted in the corridor: "Everyone comes in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince's face is ugly and ugly. Although Asa and Sandru did not have any alert, the sword in his hand did not have any movements. Not afraid, but his fighting spirit is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breath storm in the corridor has been flattened and disappeared as suddenly as it appeared. The head of Roland stood up straight and his sword was never unsheathed. At this time, the talents that can be seen on his forehead are all sweaty and even a little tired. He didn't seem to be a living person when he bent over and waited for the sword to draw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s head looked back and looked at the corner and sighed very hard as if he had just finished a long run. He did not speak straight into the house. When he stepped, his feet screamed and screamed. The marble floor where he stood was not crushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the head of Roland’s body came a corner of the footsteps and a figure of a straight and cold mountain appeared from there. Although it has long been known that a person who can give such an imposing manner can only be a person who can only be him but sees the person’s last bit of struggle, the last struggle of the Duke is completely collapsed. That is the friend Gru of Cedros. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s head went into the study and nodded to Sandro and Rodha and then looked at Asa and finally looked at the Duke. There was no expression on his face, and there was no astounding light in his eyes. But the Duke’s expression has begun to collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, the guards who should have swarmed outside have still not appeared. The surroundings are still quiet. The wisdom of the Duke is enough to make him understand what this all presupposes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru also entered the study. He didn't look at his eyes and fell coldly on the head of Roland's head. "I just gave you the opportunity to pull the sword and why didn't you pull it out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Because there is no need." Colonel Roland answered faintly. His hand had already let go of the sword and now I don’t know when to hold it again. But he did not look at Gru but scanned the surroundings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't want to try?" Gru's eyes fell on the sword of Roland's leader's waist. He seemed to have a dark bottomless scorpion. Two black flames flashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s head faintly looked back at his still very plain voice: “Don’t want to.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Gru’s eyes swept through the faces of the heads of Asarrodhart and Roland, but did not see the Duke. Then he looked at Sandro and suddenly asked coldly: "Do you say that the people here are all the same way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should be it." Drew nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That man." Gru's voice has been murderous. But his eyes did not look at anyone but looked at the bookcase next to him. His eyes were sharp and sharp, as if the wooden shelf full of books was more lethal than the leader of Roland. "You still can't come out? I want all the people here to ask you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone looks at it but it is just a bookcase. . Asa and Rodhart even include Sandro's expressions are a bit bleak. Only the expression of the head of Roland did not change. His hand was always on the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for General Gru and the head of Roland, everyone’s face changed, especially the Duke and Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This study is not small but it is not too big and the furnishings are not complicated. Even if a cat wants to hide and is not seen, it is impossible. Moreover, the Duke’s study has no windows or even vents for the sake of confidentiality. This means that this person has been here since the beginning. The words of the Duke and Asa were all seen by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this person left the bookcase, all the talents in the corner of the bookcase are lighter. He just dissolved it with the little darkness. Even if he looked at him, he wouldn’t pay attention to him at all. Even Roland’s head had only a little feeling and only Gru had noticed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really old... It’s actually noticed by two people... It’s still being found...” The voice of this person is weird but can be heard Full of frustration. This is a very thin body with a golden skull mask wrapped in a black tights. Even if it appeared like this, it seems that he always seems to be a man or a woman in a shadow that is unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s face changed. This strange voice and mask he has heard of the two necromancers who have seen him. But their masks are all silver, but they are dark gold. But Trud seems to be more surprised than Asa. His expression is eccentric. Say: "Is you? You....you...what are you doing here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person looks at the dark golden mask of Sandro and hides his eyes completely In a shadow, I can only hear the plain taste from the tone: "I heard that you died to help you collect the corpse. But it seems as if you are lying down..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shandro’s expression is very weird. It’s a bit too happy and a bit stunned. It’s a bit uncomfortable to talk at all. It’s a bit unnatural to say: “Thank you for caring about me...”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't care about you. Just care about the things you took away. What do you do when you are taken back by the guild after you die?" The man floated to the door of the study. "Since you are not dead, I will go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop." Gru and Roland’s head spoke at the same time. The two men stood in the same door and moved to the door. The eyes of the two eyes pierced the person like the light of the tip of the needle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is not moving at all. Not because he is obedient because he can't move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be no earth-shattering change in the study, but it is still quiet but Rodhart suddenly stumbles. His forehead was full of cold sweat and three people looking pale at the entrance to the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa still stood but the forehead also began to have cold sweat. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the confrontation between the heads of Gru and Roland is a storm, the atmosphere of the two men’s joint efforts in this study is a pot of molten steel. It seems to be calm, but the taste is thick and hot dozens of times. Almost every breath can feel the lungs twitching under the pressure of this momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing." Shandrew screamed at the heads of Gru and Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think you'd better explain it." Colonel Roland ignored the fact that Sandro had been watching this person as a sword. Asked faintly. "If you really look for Mr. Sandro, why are you always lurking here? And if this mask is not acknowledged, it should be someone who represents you as a Necromancer. If you don't prove that you are not our potential enemy. You can't go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru did not speak. The head of Roland said what he meant. Even if they can be on their own, the lives of their monarch friends will only be at risk if such a person with a sneak technique is so high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current situation of two enemies is undoubtedly the best time to kill such a dangerous person. Both Gru and Roland’s heads understand this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be too much." The eyes of Sandro's eyes slammed into the bodies of Gru and Roland. The momentum of the two immediately caused a slight fluctuation. This opportunity was just a flash of light and drifted into the corridor. Then the next moment disappeared into the corridor environment like a sharpest chameleon. Just leave a word that is gradually disappearing: "...Reassured, I have been too lazy to be an enemy. I am hiding here just because I want to help this kid to save his life."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sander’s eyes and expressions also returned to their usual appearance and even a bit of a sigh of sighs and said, “You can rest assured. He and I have no interest in what conspiracy you have in the country. This time. Maybe it’s just just helping me collect my body.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru looked and turned to Asa and said: “I just didn’t come in because it seems to be here now. There are also individuals. I have always been unable to understand whether the enemy or the friend is not good. Only let yourself find a way to start with me and then wait for an opportunity to move. But I can’t think he was also planning to help you.” He showed a very small See you smile. "Your business seems to be a loss. It takes so much effort to convince us to help you. It turns out to be in vain. Even if you are alone, you will be absolutely shocked. I have so many waiting here. Yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed with a sigh of relief and said with a smile: "Not at all, at least my purpose seems to have been reached." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru faintly said: "I don't care what your purpose is. But since you are not dead, you must do it if you promise us."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't trust my debts." Asa smiled a bit. "Especially depends on your personal account."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that there is nothing wrong with me. I will go back and get the two-legged dragon back. Gru coldly saw the Duke glanced colder and dropped a sentence. "In any case, I think this person should not be able to live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this sentence all the spirit of the Duke has completely collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not unaware of his death. When the leader of Sandru and Roland appeared together, Gru also knew that he had no room for turning over. Death is inevitable. What he can't accept is failure and it's a failure to be so complete and inexplicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes ago he still felt that he was the master of the world, and all the people were at his mercy. However, it is only after a few minutes that he is now being manipulated and is actually himself. Just now he just stayed here and watched these people talking and talked about almost no one to look at him. The last sentence of Gru shows that in the eyes of the winners, he is no longer relevant to a dead person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this failure is just luck or occasional negligence. The leader of Roland just saw his own flaws in a coincidence. The old man of the Necromancer just had luck to escape or the appearance of Gru and the mysterious figure was indeed beyond his own expectations. He will be much better off. It's a pity that not everyone who is born here is not alone. It is not a coincidence that it has been planned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Own arrangements are just a part of someone else's arrangement. After so many years of strategizing, it was only the supporting role of a failed clown. The spirit of the Duke is no longer a vocabulary of pain and despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke slowly and steadily sat down all the things he saw in his eyes now, including everything in the Duke’s House, which began to collapse and collapse. He muttered in the most powerless voice of his life: "How is it so quiet around?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, it’s still so quiet, not just the king outside. The Guards did not appear in the Ducal House. It seems to suddenly become a ghost house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They have all left your order from the Dukes," Rod Hart replied. His voice is still polite and courteous. "I told them that the Duke and the head of Roland would have to interrogate the prisoner not to get up close."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke closed his eyes and nodded slowly: "Then you Just wait outside and wait for me to say something more to this kid who I think is only dead, know and then come in and let him go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Deha has nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke sighed and silenced. He has completely not wanted to resist the struggle. Although he is by no means a weak person, there are two top-ranking powerhouses here. He does not want to struggle in vain like a dog and is then slaughtered by people. Moreover, his fighting spirit has already collapsed and there is no residue left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland Head and Rod Hart quietly watched the Duke not making a sound. It seems that Sandro’s thoughts are not here at all. And Asa did not say anything, he knew that he had no need to say anything now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
