			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru did not move Asa did not move the Pope and Lancelot Talis naturally did not move to maintain such a delicate balance between each other It was just a warning to this unclear eccentric character and did not subconsciously stop him in the first place. After all, his direction of casting is obviously not here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is best for you to stop him." Adela's face was white. He still can't see what the magic of this man is. The magic power of this person is not too high in his eyes, but he can complete such a complicated magical array with such a quick degree. Even if the body before him needs at least More than double the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru cold snorted and he was still in place but the light in his eyes suddenly increased. Everyone who approached him felt a bit of inexplicable monuments. Wonderful trenches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray robes are still there to prepare their own magic, but there are two places on the back of the neck that have begun to leaching blood and more and more constantly There was blood flowing down the neck as if the flesh there suddenly became two rotten sponges soaked with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru has not shot but his eyesight and killing has come to this person. This is not magic, it is just pure eyes and killing. Under this imposing manner and attention, the human body can no longer bear the same as the two real and tangible swords in the flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most subtle spells and gesture errors in the preparation of the Great Magic will cause the magical counterattack to be so hurt. The magician can almost be equal to the life. But this person did not stop the gesture and mourn the voice. There was no slight trembling gesture. Even the slightest deviation did not appear. It seems that the flesh on the back of the neck is not related to him. His movement is still getting faster and faster. In the air, the extremely complex magical array and the mourning spells in the mouth are drawn in the air almost completely. The magical fluctuations in the air have been completely rushing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s that guy." Asa suddenly screamed and rushed to the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally figured out who this is. Although the intricacies of the gestures and mantras have already come out of what he knows, it is indeed necrotic magic that is uploaded from this person. And this gray robes, from the beginning, he felt that it seemed familiar and gradually appeared with the fluctuations of the Necromancer. The robes are also agitating and resonating with him, and this finally remembers what it is. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, in this place, in the robes of the Ghost King who was stolen by Sandron, cast the Necromancer in this strange way. It’s only because of Hamm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Asa is not sure what he is doing now, but it is clear that as long as this person wants to do something, it is better to stop him from doing it. Especially for a person like him who is used to safely hiding in the dark, but now he is willing to expose himself to the plot to prepare things that will not be just a magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Asa’s now is slower than when he just rushed out because Hamm’s magic has been completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazing magical powers such as the torrents that have been pressed for a long time. It happened to be completely in the body of Inham. According to the program he built with gestures and mantras, he constantly resonated and changed the magnified metamorphosis and then spewed forward toward the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the swordsman priests facing him at this time only felt the amazing mana of the bishop was just that they had no time to react. * The mourning and gestures of the body posture spells are fully integrated. It is indeed impossible to change this magic. He is in the present position and is facing away from the bright hall to the large number of swordsmen and priests on the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗哧. Just like a man with a large glass of water in his mouth, the sound of the old society is spurting out, but the sound is tens of thousands of times because it is the sound of thousands of swordsmen and priests on the square. At a single volume, they also spurted a sip of water. They were not slobbering but blood. All the swordsman priests facing him, with a huge arc of radiation centered on Inham, were all spurting blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just using your mouth to spray your eyes, your nose and ears have become a place where you can spit blood. These humans and orcs are like the ones that have suddenly become watered and squeezed by humans. Countless blood has been ejected from their five senses and has become countless blood arrows. Even the flesh and blood viscera are all flying together. The bodies of these people and the orcs are drying up quickly. Many people are squirting a lot of blood, and they become a dead body. The flesh and blood flies together and there is only one solitary skeleton left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
