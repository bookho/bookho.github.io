			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Yabin first saw Bishop Esshir, it was exactly the same feeling that Talis had told him before. If this person can't believe it, then he can't believe anyone else anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Elisha red archbishop is sitting on the upper side, but he is more solemn and dignified, but more is a top-down majesty. . The temperament of a bishop who is in charge of the whole kingdom is reflected in the best of both worlds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And according to Talis, the cardinal said that although the white magic seemed to be unrecognizable to them, they did not believe what they said but it was big. 6 The first mental magic can definitely treat Ai Mei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abinie was only a big sigh of relief at this time. He can finally be sure that this step is indeed the right one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This step is very big and even a bit too big. At least when he started to leave, he did not have the confidence to let him take that step. In fact, it was more of an impulse at the time. Even if he can really rescue the female knight, the knight will not listen to him. Even if I listen to the letter, what kind of reaction will be difficult to predict. But after all, he still made a bet with his own and his sister's life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it seems that this bet is indeed right. Talis was grateful to Abin for saving herself from the group of vicious thieves. She also knew that it was not as simple as death in the hands of the group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although those things that were born in the wilderness sounded really ridiculous, Talis still believed what Abin had said to her. It seems that just by feeling she knows that this young man will never be a liar to make such a lie. The trust and feelings generated in adversity can often reach a very high level. Talis does not even care about the behavior of this young man who is in the runaway. And from the depths of her own heart, that slap in the face is also a reason she believes this young man. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Talis himself took the initiative to send Ai Mei to the Celeste treatment, but Abin did not agree. He has never dared to go to the church with his sister to seek help. One is to avoid the white magic of the two people. The most important thing he remembers is how clear the white magic that was used by the man who controlled the werewolf in the darkness at night, at least the priests who needed the bishop level could do it. I still haven't figured out what is going on behind the scenes before going to the church for help. So he asked Talis not to stretch out, but asked her to find a person who is absolutely reliable and absolutely worthy of dependence<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God is with you. Bishop. "Abindin is kneeling down on the knees and bowing respectfully to the Assyrian salute. Regardless of his status or the majesty, the cardinal really can withstand 'absolutely reliable.' Definitely worth relying on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of Escher nodded and looked at him with a very interested eye and then turned around and said to Talis: "You go back first." Go out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis a glimpse: "The bishop is you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Bishop Esshir smiled and said: "When someone will use the spell to treat the girl, I will be distracted. No one other than their two brothers and sisters can get close to here. You and the outside guards are also leaving here. A little further. In order to avoid any noise that disturbs my concentration."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Talis retired. When I walked out of the room, I showed a smile and a smile to Abin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin was also amazed and happy. He did not expect the bishop to be so quick to agree so quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the room is closed. Only two brothers and sisters and Bishop Esshir were left behind. Talis's footsteps were getting smaller and smaller and then gradually drifted away with a few footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal listened carefully to the sound and determined that the others around him had gone far. Then he smiled and asked Abin: "You are the anti-Guide Talis Knight from Is that rescued from the group of thieves?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Yabin nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aescher’s smile on his face did not move as if he had come out with a sigh of relief: “Is it that you got her alone? Nothing else Human help?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another explosion of thunder and thunder light from the outside of the window shines on the face of the cardinal. He now smiles and now looks more than just a mysterious and stranger of majesty and kindness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin did not say that all the things were left unreservedly, at least the mysterious man took the initiative to put them both. He did not It may be said. This incident is almost more bizarre than the night of the wilderness. Don't say that Talis will believe that it is incredible to think back on his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai Yimei has not cured this kind of confusing. It’s natural to add suspicion and blame, but you don’t have to say it. Moreover, even he himself could not understand exactly what the man was all about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the man’s confession to him, he told Talis that the thieves were about to go to Tula. So Talis immediately rushed back to Celeste when she appeared again in front of Abin. The news brought by Abin was surprisingly incomprehensible. The man who let go of what they claimed to be Sandefis and claimed to be Sandru was actually a big name. It was all over the world and was joined by almost all countries and organizations. As long as everyone wanted the big six-headed wanted criminal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After knowing this news, Abin decided that the conversation between himself and the man would not let others know. Even the later contact with Talis was longer and he never dared to tell her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color of the horror did not translate into a shocked Abin, keeping a very appropriate expression and shaking his head and replied: "There is no other person to help the bishop. At that time It is the thief of the extreme evil. I have courageously strengthened my faith in the Lord before I cringe before the danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bishop of Ascher did not This kind of response, like a template, responded with a faint smile. Q: "Does the man who claims to be Sandy not help you escape? Or is it not that he let you save the Talis Knights?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asia Bin felt that the muscles on his face had approached the limit and almost immediately rushed to control the strength. The vest clearly feels cold and almost snoring, but he is sweating hard. He can't tell the difference in the chest and abdomen and the mind is amazed or confused. He used all his strength to keep his tone and expression as normal as possible: "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your self-control is good." Ace Bishop Chaer nodded. "But you have to know that few people can lie in front of a mental magician. Your blood is breathing. The key to your eyes is that the fluctuations of your mind will betray you. And if it is not the kid who deliberately let you go, you can't save. I got the Talbi Knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bishop of the Lord swears that I am definitely not with that person..." Abin’s forehead has been soaked in cold sweat. . Bitter in the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't have to swear, the Lord is inaudible, but I am not interested in listening. I can see from your reaction that you can't be with that kid." "The guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bishop of Ascher has waved his hand. "I just want to know how many people have you told the wild land?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only told Talis Knight. This one I don’t dare to say about the reputation of the church..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bishop of Escher waved again and let Abin stop, he didn’t look at the ground again. Abin and Ai Meimei, who muttered to the chair next to him, stood up and repeatedly picked up the steps in the room. The brows locked their eyes and looked at the ground while looking at the squally showers outside the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin is still squatting. I dare not get up and dare not speak. Although he was surprised and even scared, he did not lose control. He knows his purpose and his position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Talis's description, I got the news and went to Tula, not just that she had three other Knights of the Temple and ten Templars. There is even a cardinal who serves the pope and the paladin Lancelot who is considered to be the guardian god of Celeste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what kind of wanted criminals seem to be too exaggerated. It seems that it is not going to catch people and to flatten the Elf Forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the end, such an unimaginable lineup couldn’t have been won. It’s not just thieves and elves waiting for them in the forests of Tula. Two masters of the wild land. The Lord of the City of Oude Landes and General Gru are actually there. After an earth-shattering battle between the two sides, they did not have the slightest benefit to get their troops under the intervention of the elves. The only gain is that it only annihilates the thieves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hard to imagine that he would not think about it. His only purpose is to find a way to cure his sister. So even the bishop in front of him suddenly spoke out what she had been hiding, and he was just surprised. After all, the bishop’s adult suddenly spoke out what he had been hiding, and he was just surprised. After all, the bishops have already said that they want Ai Mei to cure those surprises and fears are subconscious reactions. As long as Ai Mei can cure himself, it doesn't matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bishop of Escher finally stopped and looked at the window and muttered: "I don't think a pastor who was started in the priest can use the magic of God's shelter. It’s an accident. Maybe it’s just that this ignorant loyal loyal person can truly spread the power of faith. I care about it...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although not A complete understanding of the meaning of the cardinal discourse, Abin, can not help but can not help but ask: "Does the bishop say that you believe what I said?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe that I naturally believe that I don't believe it?" Escher turned and looked at the high majesty of Abin, which was higher than looking like an ant. He disdainfully sneered at the little ant who was half-squatting. "You are not there yet? It was me that night. I controlled the werewolves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge thunder throughout St. Peter's Basilica They are all shaking slightly. The electric light that passed through the window made everything shine. This thunderstorm is so big that it seems to tear up the entire kingdom of Elazia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin did not hear the thunder or he did not know when he heard it. The cardinal’s sentence instantly smashed his mind and smashed his mind as if it had become empty and seemed to be exploding as soon as he did not know what it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of Escher looked at the half-baked Abin, sneer a wave of colorful light around him and immediately fell into his In the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the strength and vitality in the body suddenly became a group of Abin, who is familiar with this feeling. In the wilderness, the night is full of blood and killing. Such a spell set him up with his sister grandfather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really annoying flies. I can’t think of a fish that leaked the net to tell Talis the chick if she told Lancelot again. It would be a bit of a hassle. Forced me to waste my energy..." The Cardinal stared at Abin and sighed. He had to waste his energy on the flies and was annoyed in the majestic face. Slowly, his eyes began to radiate a faint glow in the eyes of Abin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will cure your sister but she will not remember anything. She will only remember. She will only remember the grandfather of that night. The tragic moment of death will wake up in a nightmare every night. Can't sleep well. After a long time, she will die because she is sad and frightened. And these are all caused by you?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin maintains that half-squatting posture. Eyes have been watching Ashur. He only felt that even his own thinking seemed to be rigid under the paralysis, and it was too late to respond to this sudden change. All the spirits were attracted to the eyes with the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cardinal’s voice is not loud, but the wind and rain outside the window can’t cover every word and every syllable. Every note that flies out of his mouth seems to contain strange powers that are no longer just words in the ear. Instead, it became a thinking idea that forced the mind to listen to the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know that these are your faults?" It was a thunder. The sound of Escher's voice is even more fascinating in the thunder. He now seems to be a nightmare that is casting a spell not only to pour his own voice into the brains of others but also to sculpt a mark in the deepest part of memory and soul. "You will be very self-blaming and blame yourself. If it weren't for you, maybe your sister wouldn't die. After your sister's death, you will dream of your grandfather and your sister every night. At the end you will only commit suicide..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mental magic is definitely an unpopular magic not only because of the difficulty of cultivation of this magic, but also because the system is cultivated to a higher level and cannot be compared with other magic. It can neither blast the rock nor burn the enemy that tears the enemy. The only people who can make a difference are people who live. It can't even kill a chicken directly. If there is a magical master of a department who lives in the wild and has problems with survival, it can only be a mental system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The words I am saying now will not be forgotten until you die, but they will never be remembered." The words of Escher seem to be contradictory, but this is no longer important. In the words of the mental magician, the language is actually a false one. The consciousness contained in it is what people really rely on to communicate. "You will only remember that I am here to cure your sister. I am very grateful to you. Then you take your sister away from Elazia to find a place where no one is present..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aescher did not care about the girl muttering next to herself. He was concentrating on the Abin. The magical magic is magic, so you must concentrate. Moreover, Aescher also feels that because of the practice of white magic, this young man can actually have a little resistance to his mental magic. And this method of casting is never a bit of a scorpion. His spirit has been concentrated on feeling the heart of the target in front of him. He wants to pinch it in his hands and deeply impress everything he just said into the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a huge noise ringing. But this time it was not just a thunder and a broken window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window shattered into a sky full of glass and wood debris, and a dark shadow rushed in with the raging wind and rain outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder sounds, sound, sound, sound, sound, sound, sound, sound, sound, sound, sound, sound, sound, sound, sound, sound, sound, sound <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is slower in the ear. The figure with the gust of wind and the thunderstorm is faster than the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aescher is facing the window, but it is irrelevant to face it at this time. His reaction seems to be inconsistent with being a magician and being too old. He actually has time to look up and shock and retreat. But his attention and all his spirits have just concentrated on the ground on the Abin. All his magical power has been condensed on the mental magic that is being instilled in consciousness. This is the biggest time for his weakest flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade figure has no strong murderousness with each other and it is filled with the squally showers. This is a chance to kill. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aescher’s retreat seems to be in vain. Although his reaction was fast enough, he almost noticed the murderousness before the window was broken, but the old pace in front of that blast was really slow. It is vain as a tortoise in front of an arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s this turtle-like step back. It’s probably only a hundredth of a second that is almost negligible. The Holy Cross on the back of Escuel's chest has shattered. This one hundredth of a second is just the cracked ten amps that burst open a white light to wrap the cardinal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade slammed on the white light and shone like a piece of glass. The blade was slightly stunned. The remaining stab continued to stab into the body of Ascher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal has a terrible mourning. This knife cuts two ribs from his right chest and then passes through the lungs and breaks the two ribs. The top broken shoulders are exposed from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the heart of Asa’s heart is a cool white light, which is undoubtedly the amulet of Escher’s life, almost touched by the electric flash The protective magic inside is sealed. Although this kind of magic released by spiritual touch is not too advanced, his knife is easily broken, but after all, he gives Esquel a little time for him to remove a little body and avoid it. The location where the heart is worn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is already the best way to attack the most sudden attack, but even then there is no one to kill. The reaction of the big magician who has experienced countless battles and sinister battles has become the limit of the magician. It is indeed worthwhile under the prestigious name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chest piercing is almost fatal to a magician but only almost. Not absolute or immediate. Especially for a white magician. Not to mention this is one of the top 6 white magic of the Big Six. Asa can feel the white magic tide in the body of Ascher, and the magic and blood-sucking effect attached to the knife around the body of the body can not be waved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muscles on his wrist immediately bulged. How much white magic, this body is just an old man who has been dying, and with his strength, even if the blade of this knife is not sharp, you can divide the skeletal muscles below into two. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
