			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s just ordinary rain, but under the elemental giant body contraction, the momentum and momentum are comparable to the heavy arrows used to attack the city. The two shots to Asa were the bodies that shot Talis in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa holds Talis, and rolls a four-way water column over the body of the two, just taking the wind and the splashing rain. It is faint and painful. The two water columns hit the ground and the muffled stones flew in the air. The other two hit the opposite water elements. The slamming splash of water and the two giants hit by the companion spread almost entirely, although they immediately regained the solidified shape in the condensed power of the magic, but the body became much smaller after a wave of rippling. The cutting puncture damage of any ordinary sharp object is ineffective against the body of the water element that has no solid form. This is that his own attack is the most harmful to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in order to completely avoid the roll, Asa also had to drop Talis in her hand. At this time, the Seya magician was still laughing and suddenly changed his face and shouted to Ou Ling: "The chick is still alive. Kill her first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ou Ling in the four water elements also hands-on the tacit understanding of the two has always been very good yellowish vindictive light wrapped around his body, he rushed to the ground to evade Asa. But when I heard the voice of Seia, the pale yellow figure was like a ghost in a rainy night without a slight pause and a stagnation of a swift and unconventional turn to the motionless Knight of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long sword that shines with countless magical runes will soon fall to Talis's slender neck but Ou Ling has to take the sword. Because at the same time a faster figure caught up with his fist and brought out the white light like the thunder of the wind. If his sword is to continue to fall, this lightning can also smash him. So he had to take the sword and turned back to meet this rushing strike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the raindrops within a few meters centered on two people. The water droplets were all smashed by the white grudge and the pale yellow grudge and the magic runes. The more the Ou Ling Yue is beaten, the fact that he is the upper hand in both sword and vindictiveness, but the actual situation is that he is falling behind. That is to fight back and fight. This opponent has used almost every stroke to make a sword with you. I will also hit a punch on your hand and even a bite to make him feel like he is not fighting with people. Instead, I was biting with an almost crazy beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he was shocked, he was half-hearted and worried. Such a crazy full-power attack will not last long anyway. What's more, there is a big magician on his head for backup. But he also has to feel weird and unpredictable. The female knight is really not dead. It is not until this time that the Seya magician reminds him like a sudden feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you are fighting with a great magician with a magical eye, you will be handed over to the opponent on the battlefield. No matter how sharp the human eye is, there is no such use of top-level magic for observation. Therefore, Ou Ling will safely hand over all observations and judgments to the court magician, but he still has such a situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the position of the court magician, this is also helpless because when Asa evades and slightly loosens the hand of Talis, the magic eye It immediately showed the weak vitality represented by the Knights of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, the magical god did not have the slightest life reaction of the Knights of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court magician is very confident in the use of his magical eyes. In fact, he does have the qualification to be confident. The magical eye is not available to every magician. As long as it is not specialized, it is impossible for a super-sorcerer to use it. He is as good as him to the grandmaster of the master. He is alone. So he is confident that if there is no life reaction in the eyes of the magic god, there are only two possibilities. Either this person is indeed dead or dying a little bit more than death. Vitality has fallen to the same level as the mouse frog bird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the magical eye of the kid can detect that he is constantly transmitting the faint magical power to Talby’s body. Magical fluctuations Even the guru's magical eyes can't tell the magic of healing the life of the Knights of the Temple. Still contains the necromantic magic of a dangerous corpse bomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as time went by, Seia was shocked to see that the magical power and vindictiveness of this opponent were constantly replied with the confrontation. Not the amazing recovery that he just lie in the corner, but it is amazing enough. After a while, it has already recovered to the point of six or seven points. So Saia has made a judgment almost immediately. It is just that the opponent’s deceitful temptation to fight for time to restore strength and then find a way to break through. So he immediately began to direct the water element attack. Even the trap of the Necromancer is more effective when he has six or seven points of strength to heal than when he recovers the full magic. The horsewoman may not die. It is necessary to do it at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the situation is clear now that it is impossible to have any trapping attacks of Necromancer. Ou Ling and the kid have already been together. His goal is naturally a knight who is seriously injured in a coma. With his gestures, the four water elements of the transparent body trembled and the squirming water condensed the arm to wave the second water arrow volley immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa knows that he is temporarily gaining the upper hand and knows that Ou Ling must be very surprised but he knows that the situation is not good. Especially when I saw the four water elements tremble like a huge jelly and waved my arms, he was more certain that the situation had reached a critical point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the original plan, he was thinking about trying his best to push Ou Ling back. But even this is the way to fight the momentum. Still can't push him back half a step. The sword that flashed the magic rune is not only sharp, but at least with more than three kinds of curses. If it is not the temper of his body, such as the tsunami flash floods, the magic of these curses will be able to withstand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this magic weapon is not the most difficult to deal with, or the first swordsman of this Erasia. Asa can be sure that even if it is not a sneak attack, even in the frontal battle, Talis will never be his opponent. If it weren’t for Ou Ling’s heart, he would hold on to his own thoughts and even fall into the wind in his full-scale attack. That sword is not as good as Lancelot. Gru's attack was as shocking as it could be, but it was fine and long but it was tough and sharp. It was like the same spider web that was woven with a sword. No matter how the offense can't knock it back, it will be stuck and it will be sharply wounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now, in any case, the spider web of this sword must be taken out because he must keep the Knights of the Temple. Not only because she will be a perfect weapon to divide Elazia and Celeste. The most important thing is that she is indeed an important reason for Asa to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa screamed a fist and slammed into the sword net and squeezed the latitude and longitude surrounding the numerous swords. At the same time, this is only a dozen more scars on the arm of the sword net. There are three pieces of meat on the shoulders. There are three pieces of meat flying in the air. The whole shoulder is flying together. If it is not the same, this arm has already been twisted into pieces. At the same time, he also had to use all the vindictiveness to resist the digestion and the three curses of the slow and debilitating and the armor on the sword. Even though it was so hard, after all, this breakthrough in the sword net was still played on Ou Ling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of hardship and hard work can not do much damage. The magic runes surrounded by Ou Ling's leather armor suddenly gathered together in front of Asa's fist. So this one could have put a stone statue and a boxing blow just to let Ou Ling squat back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even such a retreat is enough for Asa to take the opportunity to jump to Talis on the ground. But at this time, the four roads are far stronger than just now. The water column has been sprayed from the hands of the four water elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just the water column with four arms. What came out was the huge sound of the waterfall and the tsunami, and even the surrounding air and raindrops were pushed away under the huge wind pressure. Even the body of four water elements became a small circle because of this blow. This is a blow to these elemental creatures. Although it is only the water, even the defensive power of the Glorious Battle Armor is absolutely impossible to resist under these four strong joint attacks. What's more, there are two elements of water that are the head of the Knights of the Temple. Even the head of the elephant is splashed with the same water as the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa has jumped to the side of Talis, but no matter how fast his hand is, he can’t pick up the knight and dodge it. The angle of attack of the four water elements is just right. No matter how he rolls over and dodge, he can't avoid it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seya magician was surprised to see that Asa was able to retreat from Ouling and then saw him actually rushing toward Talis’s side. . In fact, after his current female knight is still alive, he already understands the current life of the horsewoman. Since the kid has been hiding her vitality, it means that it must be a picture. Now, as long as it can kill her, the killer who killed the Bishop of Ascher can even ignore it. But I can't think of this guy actually not taking this opportunity to escape but jumping to the side of the horsewoman, which is exactly a double-edged sculpture. He is very confident in his own attack on the water element. Even if there is vindictiveness, it is absolutely impossible to resist the opponent's bare hands. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the four strands of fierceness are not exactly like the water's water column meets and hits the target with a muffled hammer like a siege hammer hitting the city gate. Like the darts, the water splashes out countless small points on the surrounding walls. Even the nearby Lingling has to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
