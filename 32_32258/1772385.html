			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa with Ai Meimei into the beast crowd quickly came to an empty vacant lot in the center. It was surrounded by the orcs around and there were two squadrons that couldn’t see the scene here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several orc collars carefully guarded the middle of the grotto lying on the ground, his chest tied with a strip of cloth that penetrated the body through a huge sword wound still still seeping The body of blood and the surrounding ground have been dyed red. However, his eyes are still slightly stunned, although they are powerless, but they are still dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Asa is back." A scarred werewolf collar was anxiously half-slung to see Asa stand up immediately. He did not have a tail with a huge hand on his claws, but the ring carved with a few magic jade was Luken. The chopping knife that he had turned into a machete with the nails of the behemoth was carrying a golden giant bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can hold it well." Asa looked at Gruson with a sigh of relief. Although he did not see it with his own eyes, Lancelot and the Pope believed that Gru was indeed dead. This is not blind confidence. Needless to say, the wounds caused by the swordsman who did not have the therapist Lancelot's full sword in the orcs could not be cured even if the Pope used the white magic himself. And that sword is a fatal wound that is undoubtedly passed through the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for Asa’s arrival with the orc, it’s just that Gru is really dead. Only when he used natural magic to restore his vitality, while using the Necromancer magic to control the part that died under the incomparable sword of Lancelot, the sword would not continue to spread and continue to slaughter the vitality in the body. This barely pulled him back from the edge of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think it's my turn to owe you one time." Gru said his body. Even if his body has weakened to such a point of view and momentum, there is not a slight weakness. Since the elite is stronger than anyone. It seems that as long as he is still alive, he has no idea of ​​the concept of 'soft' and 'weakness'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now that is a little early." Asa smiled and smiled. He really didn't know how to explain Cedros's death Gru as soon as he would know the truth. And once I know it, I have to find Egner and I will never let the two fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How are you over there? Have you got it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be considered... "Assad just said half of it suddenly turned to the direction of the Great Hall." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several big priests in the hall together, slowly chanting the mantra with the completion of the mantra, two fiery bombs, two thunder bombs, and the orc position Fly over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs have concentrated very much as long as the four top magics are bursting open and dead in them. But also when the big priest began to recite the curse, the corpses around the ground began to wriggle and then at the time of the magical shots of several great priests, the corpses also jumped and flew out and overlapped together. It became a weird shield. All four magics slammed into the corpse shield and slammed into the smashing shards of the corpses, and the shards of the cockroaches were everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After flying in the shard of information, a gray shadow with a fiercely smashed voice rushed toward the front of the Guangming Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gray shadow is swift and fierce, but the big priests have not damaged Lancelot before they are able to break through the holy The sword on the knight's hand. Lancelot cross-swords pick this gray shadow and fly diagonally onto a huge stone pillar of the cr. This is a rough gray knife that can't hide its sharpness and is full of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot's face with this knife is hard to see. He saw it. This knife is not thrown out. Instead, it was shot by a werewolf with a golden giant bow. The momentum of this knife is not too strong. This wolf is not very likely to use the bow and the bow is not his. Although it was only a glance, Lancelot also recognized that he knew the bow for decades and knew the owner of the bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the stability of the war, I have never seen Wells Kellyslot. I have long known that he is already fierce and less. This is a terrible companion in the battle. Stop him one. It was not until the grief and anger that the golden giant bow had been suppressed in the heart. He screamed in the air and went straight to the entire Glorious Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The whole army attacked an orc and did not leave." The voice has not fallen Lanslot has turned into a white light band to fly toward the beast. The swordsmen and pastors who had already been surrounded by the shouts shouted the magic of white magic. All kinds of magic swords rushed toward the central beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this high morale and momentum is only a moment of banging. Everyone saw Lancelot fall back ten times more than just now, and the sound of a flying meteor crashed into the bright hall. The stone pillars on the megalithic columns are scattered and splashed. It takes several people to fall down. Lancelot struggled to stand up from the rubble and the sword in his hand had been crushed and covered with injuries. It’s just that the half-blinking martial arts have just been prevailing, and the war gods, who are so powerful, are already covered with scars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the beast crowd just got a boxing fly Lanslot Groud, but the white smug of the white body shines brightly. The shouts and screams on the battlefield did not decrease. It’s just that this is no longer from the mouths of the soldiers of Celeste but from hundreds of orcs. Their god of war is standing up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people who saw him were stunned. Even the swordsmen who had already swarmed could not help but stop the action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last piece of the world tree leaves...the bastard..." Adela's lips shook white. Several of the great priests and cardinals around him have flew to the side of Lancelot to use the madness to pour out all the pilgrims. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I owe you a kid again." Gru looked at Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to say that I just don't want to die. Just...just you..." Asa answered but he looked at Gru's eyes but was a little surprised. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed an option that has no choice. Regardless of the importance of this world tree leaf, it is now the only viable way to use it for Gru. Only when he replied can he hope to live out of this glorious castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even even the healing spells can't heal the wounds in the face of this ancient elf's magical props. But what makes Asa very surprised is that the effect of this world tree leaf on Gru seems to be not the same as the previous two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that was used on Otaru was that he completely treated his injury. After he used it, he merged with the power of the Sunwell and the real meditation to greatly enhance his magical power and vitality. Gru, who now uses the last leaf of the world tree, is completely different from the healing of the wound and he seems to be somewhat different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the previous murderousness of his people makes people feel shocked and feared as an infection between the same kind and that now everyone from him feels it is a kind of self The pressure and momentum of the above is completely different from the pure pressure before. The kind of Asa that is felt from the depths of the soul is only experienced in the body of Moriel. It seems to be an imposing manner that is far more powerful than human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the changes in the body of the world tree bring some changes to his body. It seems that there are some subtle things in his body that are dying this time. The cure has stirred these up. Everyone’s attention was completely unconsciously attracted to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it now, don't say this... let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;一前Afterwards, both Gru and Asa went straight to the Guangming Hall. After all, there are still thousands of warriors and priests around the Glorious Castle. Only the thief is the only way to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with Gru’s foot, he made a faint shadow before he got up and felt that his spirit was also awkward. The orcs immediately rushed out louder shouts and screams, and together with the swordsmen, the priests stunned and realized that they should do something to stop. The battle was not long before it was even more fierce at this moment. Suddenly, the way came out again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this time the battle is doomed to not last long. The surrounding swordsmen are too late to move. Asa and Gru have already rushed to the light. Before the main hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot’s injury did not return to his blood and scars, but he still screamed at the white sigh of breath. Around the body condensed into a huge lightsaber to meet Gru Ling. The violent blood in the violent temperament is only through the previous attack. Lancelot has understood that this enemy is no longer an enemy that can evenly match. This is already his best effort. <br /><br />############################################################################################################ Light arrow fire wall ice thorn lightning and paralysis all slanted toward the figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
