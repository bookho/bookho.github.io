			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The well water of the Sun Well under the Elven Tree is recovering with an extremely slow degree. With the slow recovery of well water, the role of the sun-defense field is slowly re-playing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is really slow, it takes at least a full day to fully recover. But now it has begun to have a considerable impact on the magician's combat power. At least the dozens of magicians on the ground are already struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead wood guard is too much, just because the element giant can no longer resist the constant pressure of these giants. The digital fire magicians used the wall-fire technique and the hell flames to blaze and smash the flames and explosions between the dead wood guards. In the curse and gestures of the earthen masters, the ground rushed up a huge column of soil and spikes to withstand the dead wood guards and unicorns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the thousands of flying flags in the sky, one of the arrows suddenly broke through the hurricane shield and bypassed the ice wall and flame protection. The gap of the shield runs through the neck of a magician from the side. The magician fell to the ground and licked his bloody neck and feet and twitched out the dying geese. The earthen armor that originally protected his body has gradually weakened and fell off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the third magician who fell under the Elf Arrow. The protective magic that seems to be seamless, such as Hurricane Aegis, does not know when to start the general meeting. Some strange fluctuations are either weak or the operation suddenly pauses or suddenly reveals a hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Elf Archers are also unable to capture these faint changes and shoot, but they don't need it. It's like that even if the naked eye can't see the hole in the roof, the rain will naturally seep into it. This rain-like arrow can never miss any hole. The bodies of the three magicians on the ground are already very problematic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How does it seem that the effects of magic are unstable? This forest is weird!" Finally, there is a magician who has this problem in the explosion of his own hands. Road. "Everyone can sit on the air and go to heaven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. The magic power is not enough to summon the air element. In this forest, the magic recovers too slowly." A gas system* teacher tried to summon the elements but was almost ruined by the magical counterattack brought by the failure. "Don't go any further, keep this formation waiting for the masters of Aiden above."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war dying genie patrol Kelin has been lightly Raised back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a burning of fire on her body and there were stuns and impacts on the ground. There are also a few magical ice thorns stuck on her hands and feet. Her reaction and skill are good, but the most crucial thing is that the anger of the dozens of magicians who have been so angry has not been able to blow her into minced meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Elder Luya is alone in the war?" Under the reincarnation of the elves' elders, Karin slowly woke up. "Don't we just look at it?" Karin jumped up. She still clasped the dark long bow in her hand. But just jumped up and the foot was soft and fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All the Pegasus that can carry people have been sent out and there are only the underage Pegasus." The elf elder sighed. "You can't open your phantom bow now. You can only hope that Elder Luya can shoot a little longer..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A screaming scream It was called to interrupt the voice of the elder elders and traversed the sky above the whispering forest. A scorpion in the siege of dozens of magicians exploded all over the body of the magic of the flash and the roar of the insect-specific screams from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War, the huge body that was originally slender and angular has been rotten like a rotten rag that has been used for decades. Even with strong vitality and defensive power, there are limits to dozens of advanced magic attacks that are enough to blow a mountain of iron into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But none of the magician's faces look good because there are already ten magicians who have become pieces under the giant sickle of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it's flying or gas, the degree and flexibility of the elements can't be evaded with this behemoth. Even the attacking magic can hardly hit the target accurately. The last dozens of elemental masters' slow and cursed curses and armor and other smashing wars have turned this war smashing down to blow up this monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, there is still one to win and win." A * division screamed like a warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not just that he’s actually all the magicians’ emotions are out of control. These wise old people have been completely immersed in the sorrow of the death of their companions in battle. Fear of anger and raging magical explosions and flames have already calmed down and calmed them down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only one sorcerer to deal with now. The biggest one has been fully invested and the Ai Deng master's chase is a little farther away to see a green giant shadow and a small white spot flying through the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give you a chance to give me the leaves of the world tree. I will stay here for the elf's life." Aiden's voice is cold but the eyes are red. Hot. He knew this female elf that was the only survivor of this whispering sen in a year ago. More importantly, he can feel the existence of the leaves of the world tree from this female essence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they are spinning in the air, they almost smell the illusion of the leaves. If it is not clear that he really has no chance of resisting the war, he will definitely turn and rush to grab this leaf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luya didn’t talk, even if she wanted to say it, she couldn’t say it. All her energy and spirit have been spent throwing herself out of the high movements. Every time she turns around, she feels that her heart seems to be flying out of her mouth. The hands and feet that cling to the outer shell seem to be broken by inertia at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These wars were originally the magical creatures left by the ancient elf empire. After tens of thousands of years, they only hatched and must rely on the leaves of the world tree to maintain within a certain range. With her consciousness, she had to sit on the war with the leaves of the world tree. And now these three cockroaches are almost all the hopes of the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has been vaguely aware from the beginning that this group of wizards led by the Necromancer came so skillfully and perhaps decided to send someone Going to visit the Tower of the Tooth has a direct relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you really can't know that the Tower of the Tooth is actually controlled by the Necromancer. But as long as we can wait until the war tree has grown and the sun well has recovered from the ban, the catastrophe will not be born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is caused by your own mistakes. It was just because of my own momentary temperament that it was a disaster. Looking at the continual screams and the screams of the flame elves below, and the physical movement of Luya, I only felt a few knives in my heart. It is not just a pain or a feeling that his heart and soul are torn together but cannot be vented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If everything can be saved, she is willing to pay any price. But she has been born and can never be recovered. She is very clear about this. Then at least try to remedy the best way to win the battle. Even if it seems that the hope is already very embarrassing, she has to fight to give up. This Necromancer is undoubtedly the leader of this group of magicians. It is also the strongest one. There may be hope as long as it can kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now it seems that this hope is already very embarrassing. No matter how the war is attacked, there is no way to keep up with this necromancer's flight. The most flexible and can only force him to dodge and fail to shoot. On the other side, there was already a war scorpion that fell under the siege of the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After stopping, Luya stood firm as quickly as possible. Take the leaves of the world tree from your own arms. Even this is very dangerous. But she must also fight for the last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great Marfa, your devout people, pray in your name to give this life..." Luya recited the leaves of the world tree of prayer The green light instantly began to flourish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chase that has been chasing himself has stopped and the master of Eden is also a glimpse. But he sees the female elf above starting to curse the leaves of the world tree. When the text was also reflected, his body shape was suddenly stopped, and a thunderous bomb blew away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning flashing thunderball is not going to Luya on the raft. Master Aiden didn't want to blow the leaves of the world tree together and smash it. As long as the monster is defeated, both humans and things are just things in the bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Aiden slightly frowns his hands again this time is two thunder bombs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two huge explosions couldn’t cover the weird squeak from the mouth of the beak. One of the forelimbs of this cockroach was completely blown up. The scent of the shards of the sky smashed with the spurs of green debris and liquid, and the struggle of the cockroaches themselves almost threw the elves above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s just that he didn’t really throw Luya down. And her spelling was still completed without interruption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Let the humble life have the life and power of a dragon to make it work for me." With the completion of the prayer, the leaves of the world tree The light on it was already bright, and it was a green light. She put the leaves of the world tree on the back of the dragon, and the inexplicable life magic surged into it. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;螳螂I still swaying the broken forelimbs on one side or pouring green body fluids outwards, but at the same time its body is as big as inflation It’s just a breath that has risen to twice the size of the original. Originally, this is only a little magical creature than the two-legged dragon, but now it has become a giant monster with a length of several tens of meters. In contrast, Aydin Master, who is not far away, seems to be just a white little sparrow, and the compound eyes seem to be bigger than him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;龙. I am afraid that only such a huge dragon can be found in such a huge body. And such an original life and attack is far away from any beast of magical insects. This kind of body is probably not much worse than the real dragon in terms of combat power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Aiden looked straightforward. But he still did not forget to shoot the fourth thunder bomb in his hand. There was still a splatter of shells in the huge roar of electro-light flashing, but this time the explosion only left a mark that was not conspicuous on the other forelimb of the cockroach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thunderbolt has almost no obvious effect. It’s too late to be surprised. Aiden’s master only saw this hill-sized monster with a deafening squeak. Rushed towards myself. Although the body has become huge, but the degree has not declined, it seems to be faster. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost alone instinctively reacting to Aiden’s masters with the ultimate in air magic, using flying to fly like a flexible fly from a person’s finger The airflow that slid across the surface of the sickle from the face almost made him think that his face had been cut. The forelimbs of the sickle, which had been somewhat outrageous, are now bigger than a small boat. Needless to say, if the human body is an elephant, it may be split into two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luya sat down on the back of the coffin on the back of a crust that could be accommodated because of growing up. She can't move almost even now. This is the natural system-level magic that can only be used with the help of the power of the leaves of the world tree. The power of the dragon is so powerful that almost all her energy is exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what she can do all the rest. Only the difference between this and the real dragon can not be dealt with. The magician is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the magicians who have been accustomed to the light roads still use a huge number of curses and magic bombardments to blow up another one. They naturally saw this incredible natural magic scene and swarmed in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One side of the forest, one man and one woman, are rushing in the direction of the ancient tree of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above-mentioned dense ancient branches and leaves can faintly see the magicians sitting on the elements of the gas are taking turns to bomb a huge green shadow. A variety of magical lights and roars come and go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assacma ran in the direction of the war tree, although the shadow of the forest prevented him from seeing the direction of the war tree, but he could feel the sun well position. The faint fluctuations scattered there and his body are resonating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his third time to whisper. It seems that every time I come to this forest, I will inevitably get involved in the battle. He really doesn't know whether it is his luck or the luck of the elves. There is no doubt that this time the battle must be because of the only remaining world tree leaf. That thing does not know whether it is the sacred object of the elves or the source of the disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you going to help those elves? Let me explain that I will not help these heresy. "There is a loud voice followed by his Talis.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
