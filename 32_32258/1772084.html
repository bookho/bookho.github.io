			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war in the West has fallen into a strange deadlock before it unfolds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the countries around the wild land have sent the ambassadors to receive a few batches in just a few days. These people are all the same in the same way, asking the emperors to stand still because they have businessmen in the city. Some small countries have already recognized Oufucheng as a new independent country. Even if the military advocated war, but this huge diplomatic pressure also caused the emperor to order the troops in the west not to act rashly. At the same time, Oufucheng also very friendly to return the goods that were robbed some time ago to the folk and many nobles also began to have anti-war sentiment. It seems that the means and methods of Cedrus are indeed very effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the strange military sent back from the west. In the wilderness there was a huge undead monster, Nagas, who led all the magicians in the army to destroy, but the whole army was wiped out. Before the war, he suffered such a huge damage. The imperial court was all sensational. The military said that it was the errand of the Elni family that led to such a result. The Elni family accused General Saunders of being under the command, especially the prime minister. The pain of losing his son made him more handsome. The military naturally cannot easily agree that the daily politics is almost a place for quarrels between the two sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School of Magic appears relatively calm. Bishop Ronis rarely stated in political affairs this time that he went to the emperor to advocate retreat. He seems to be very dissatisfied with the last recommended Nags priest. This time, the son who did not appoint the Prime Minister and did not accept the candidates offered to him by the military ministers was prepared to appoint an obscure general monk to replace the fallen Nags. The priests in the command of the commander. This is a method that is not biased towards anyone. It is in line with the consistent style of the bishops. As for why such a person would be chosen because the monk’s faith and sincerity prayed for the bodies for years, he was able to get the weight of the bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this extraordinary period, the selection contest of the Paladins is still held. And it is precisely because this kind of power competition is fierce, the significance of this competition is naturally extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the generals of the empire have control over the army, they never dared to support themselves. The generals who were able to hold these large forces were not afraid that the core military forces of the empire were directly assigned to the emperors and the paladin of the church. Although there are only a thousand people in total, each member has the combat power of a high-ranking swordsman. The dozens of magicians and pastors in the empire are almost all the top elite in the empire. This huge combat power can make tens of thousands of troops. The high mobility and combat effectiveness of the chills made them squirt in the ordinary army and cut the butter better than the hot knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paladin must be operated under the common command of the Emperor and the Bishop, so there are few opportunities to be on the battlefield, but its position in the Empire. The captain of the team will be assigned to do important tasks in the army in order to exercise. This is a shortcut to the military for the Elni family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The selection of such an important force is of course extremely strict. Thousands of knights from all over the country come to participate every year, but only a dozen or so qualified people are selected from the middle. The most important thing is that the chief examiner is the head of the Paladin's Roland and the head of the Ronald Bishop Roland. Although it is a military faction, the military's strict iron-faced selflessness and personal cultivation are the perfect combination. Famous. Together with the conservative Bishop of Ronis, which is seen by others, he guarantees that the core power of the empire is not affected by political forces. No matter who belongs to any force, if you want to enter the Paladin, you must also go through the hardships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The selection will be carried out on the first day of the project a lot of preliminary assessments, equestrian gunmanship, etiquette beliefs, etc., and thousands of candidates in these rigorous exams In the middle of the water, like a washed sand, there are only a handful of nearly 100 elites. Then these survivors will compete for the last dozen places on the next day's competition. The champion will receive the badge of the Knights of the Knights, which is personally awarded by the Emperor. This is the glory of every knight and the capital of promotion. The general champion has the opportunity to become the team leader in the regiment to command dozens of members who can be used as a thousand troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's competition has become a grand festival for the king. In the open air, several high-level temporary stands were built around the open air to meet the needs of the audience. Even the emperor kneels down to watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the square can no longer use a single word to describe the people who seem to have gathered all over the king. Both the nobility and the civilians are eager to talk about the upcoming contest. The market for the betting has also come out. According to the past achievements of each entrant and the professional assessment, each person has their own odds for the supporters to express their enthusiasm with coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the odds have been as low as one to one, there are still people who continue to bet to express their support. The accumulated amount of money on him has passed the mark of a thousand gold coins. This huge number has expressed great support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether based on such a big enthusiasm or such a large amount of money, the punters even have a clear investigation of the Cavaliers' origins and experiences. It is said that this stalwart is the origin of the heroes and generals who ran out of the Knights' School in Erasia, adding a noble touch to his lineage. The rumor that has long been circulated among aristocratic youths has also saved the heroes of the Duke of Mulak from a group of big-eared monsters. This is a heroic deed of trusting his ability. Although he did not have any prominent family and did not save the Duke’s daughter, the only reward for the Duke of Duke’s Duke was to help him. The famous person who reported this game also heard from his mouth that it was said to be Airy. The accent of a poor place nearby. However, the origin of this poor wilderness combined with his experience of saving the United States and the achievements of the present has a heroic out of the dry land of the young people. The momentum of the sky is completely in line with the psychological needs of the ordinary public. The integrity of Bishop Ronnies and the rigor of the head of Roland have always guaranteed the fairness of this selection conference. So his amazing bet, which is likely to be the first civilian champion, is even more striking – and the wealthy people who cast the glamorous but small gold coins are different from the hills of the people. Just look at it and feel the momentum is compelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betting is coming to an end. The last punter went to the betting desk to put three silver coins in the square marked "Rodhardt". This is a rare big deal. This is a fancy dress with a flamboyant girl with a shoulder-length fancy dress. The shoulders and the small half of the chest are smugly exposed to make the men around me squat. The face is a little cute and cute. The rest of the makeup. Can't blame this is probably an extension of work habits and professional ethics. This screaming young lady is a well-known red card girl in Wangdu's largest brothel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The odds of feeding this beautiful lady have fallen to six points. Why do you still want to bet this Knight called Rod Hart?" The staff asked aloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I like him." The beautiful prostitute twisted her thin waist. "There are people who are handsome, temperament and temperament, and they are born with poverty. This is the real hero. The aristocrats who depend on family and nepotism compare with him." She gave a breathful breath. The casual posture of saliva is that everyone can never learn from the beautiful women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her words immediately aroused the applause of the surrounding people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a little happy to get everyone’s support. She threw a wink at the wooden board with the name on it, as if it were the person in the middle. Holding his face with a delicate hand, he said with a grudge: "I don't know when he will come to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too good. I’ll Write a note for the innocent feelings of the lady." The staff shouted loudly and wrote down the book on the book. "I wish our heroes live up to expectations and let us all win some money. I also wish that this lady will have a good harvest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This performance won The smashing of all the men around. "Would you like to be free for this hero?" "The hero seems to be a broiler. You can have luck. Remember to use more time." "When will I come to you for free? I am also interested." Young"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slut in the cheers smugly slammed her head and slammed the eyes of everyone. Walking past a young man holding her arms and looking at her smile, she squeezed a young man on his arm and smiled and reached out on her head as if it was an encouraging shot. She continued to walk into the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the smell of shavings oil left by the lady of the prostitute. There is also a comment on her. Asa feels like she has returned to her hometown pub. He now has to wait until all the formalities are done, and then go to the west today to take advantage of this last chance to see Rod Hart's game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assa walked toward Rodhart’s lounge. He wanted to see how this hero, which gathered the public’s expectations, is now ready. If nothing unexpected, Rod Hart really should win the championship. He saw yesterday's various exams and competitions. Now his friend seems to be born to be a knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course it’s not natural that this excellent performance is due to his knighthood of indulging. When a person completely indulges his life with a dream, the energy and the achievements he achieves are unmatched by others who rely on 'effort' or 'hard work'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrant's lounge is located in a hotel on the outskirts of the square. In order to allow them to rest well, there are soldiers guarding the ordinary people who are not allowed to enter. However, one of the chiefs recognized that it was the monk who was very important to the bishop. He immediately released and politely asked him if he was going to pray for the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt's room is on the top floor. Asa went upstairs and saw a person walking into the room of Rod Hart. The other guards were guarded outside and showed a arrogant alert look. There were a few curious entrants who wanted to look at the past but were immediately slammed by the guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a place where you can come in at will. And these participating knights are not people who can arbitrarily swear. Asa feels very curious. He looked around and turned around and walked to the end of the corridor. When no one noticed, he climbed out of the window in the hallway and climbed the wall outside. He broke down from the eaves into the middle of the mezzanine under the roof. The hotel's grades were quite high, and soon the top planks were so strong that they climbed up and did not make a sound. Like a gecko, he climbed into Rod Hart's room in the middle of a few moments and saw the following situation from the gap between a wooden board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A middle-aged fat man wearing a luxurious dress sitting on a chair is not necessarily aggressive but at least very powerful. With the same imposing manner, he looked at Rodhart, who was standing next to him. This man is the prime minister who he met in the Magic Academy a few days ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thinking that you can succeed by one's mind and ability, but because you are young, you only have your own idiot. The real smart person is knowledge. At the time, and knowing the people who are responsive to the current affairs." Although the prime minister is sitting, he looks at Rod Hart standing next to him with a condescending look. "I can see that you are a smart person. A real smart person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for the praise of the Prime Minister." Rodhart looked very respectful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that you can understand me and I will tell you very well. This champion is useless to you. Only really powerful. It will be useful if people get it. Even if you get the emperor's award, there are no support for the ant people. There is no background, no background, you think that you are in such a poor body, you don’t have any noble blood in your family. Is this trend-changing court going smoothly? The struggle of the political forces in the DPRK is now unimaginable. You can’t imagine that people without any background can only be pushed by political trends. It’s just a small piece. If the person in real power is unhappy or the political struggle has the need, you can still change you back to a grassroots or even let you land." The prime minister told the country boy the seriousness of the matter with a moderate degree of majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt is silent. Asa thinks that this is not an alarmist thing as if it were. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime minister’s tone slowed down and expressed a generous side. "I can see that you are a very talented person. But personal talent is useless. Whether you want to join any party's forces, you must use time to prove your loyalty and talents to be reused. I am now It is also the time of the employer that as long as you slowly prove that your talents and loyalty to me will definitely have a real day. Do you understand what I said?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt is still silent. Asa can't see his face, but there is an uneasy look in the expression of the prime minister's pretentious calmness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while I heard Rod Hart’s plain but affirmative answer: “I understand.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Very good." The prime minister showed a very satisfied look and voice. "You have a chance to show your talent and loyalty now. That is to give up the title that is useless to you. Your opponent in the final will be a knight named Sergek. He is the hottest leader of the conference. The most important thing is that he has the noble blood of the Elni family. He is one of my nephews. Do you understand what I mean?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The final venue is on the big platform in the center. On the left side of the ring The third piece of wood is a loose piece that will sink down as soon as you step on it. Do you know what I mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The masters who watched the war and many of the leaders of Roland were the first swordsmen of the empire. The fake drama must be done. It’s inevitable that there are so many pastors there should be no serious problems. Do you know?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
