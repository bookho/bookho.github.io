			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Necromancer is silent. Even Nopolinot did not have the fear and timidness of the beginning to fall into this silent silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, when it is really not polite and hypocritical, the strength is more convincing than anything. Although the power of this existence is huge, the impressions that have been left in their hearts are indelible, but the three of them are all facts. Although his strength is definitely one of the top 6 of the Big Six, it can never be the opponent of the three Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The danger of challenging authority is indeed huge, but the temptation is also irresistible. That means the shadow that hangs over your head after the victory will be completely dispersed. And the shadows on their heads are not much, as long as they go to the sky, it will be even brighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in such a situation, it seems to be justified to start killing each other. Since it is the other party's ruined shadow, there is no reason to cover it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after all, no one is the first to start because they are not the kind of age that can be rushed to fight on their heads at any time. I have nothing to worry about and I have not lived for too much time before I know how precious life is. And they all have the power to have a lot of these things, and naturally they will never want to die and they are far from enough. So they don't want to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden break in the silence by Master Aiden’s silence: "Oh, forget it, how do we say that we are all the same as the Descartes? There seems to be no need for It’s better to kill each other. It’s better...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden mask smirked: “What do you want to bet? How? Bet?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “There are five ghosts here.” Master Aiden pointed to the magical fan who flapped his wings in midair. "Your living corpse, we may not have seen it for a long time, we will gamble and you will make a living corpse to fight these five gargoyles. We will not shoot each other. If you win, we will leave. If we win, Then you don't care about this. Is this good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden mask nodded: "Good. I don't think you can enjoy playing with these two phases."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nopolinot. You operate the gargoyle." Master Eden turned his head and looked at Nopolino. The moment he turned to the golden mask, he looked strange to the eyes of the two companions. "Be careful. Our victory and defeat is on you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His two companions undoubtedly saw this look but their faces and eyes It seems that there is nothing wrong with the silence. "I know." The obese Necromancer used a very dexterous action to share a gargoyle with another Necromancer. As the other five gargoyles of his gestures gathered in the air, they arranged in a formation. The huge obsidian body is neatly acted under the command of the Necromancer, just like a soldier who has been practicing for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer under the golden mask sneered a little. He didn't operate the big eagle under his seat, but he lifted it up in the air and slowly began to shine in his hands. When the light shines brightly, his wrists are blue and watery and splashed toward the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpses of the swordsmen on the ground from the high ground were illuminated by the blue light and immediately began to squirm. The bodies that are still well-developed are standing up and the flesh and blood that have become muddy under the steel magician are constantly squirming and gathering like a pile of bright red mud monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the soil around these fresh bodies does not constantly flip. Some of the mud-like bones emerged from the land under the blue light like the sprouts in the spring rain. It’s awesome that I don’t know how long ago the corpses that existed in this land are large, like rhinoceros, and there are mice and even insects. Most of them have almost resolved the shape before birth. It’s just a group of unformed mud. Or broken bones but now they are active but they all look vibrant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground that was just dead under the blue light of the sky is now completely full of vitality. Everything is moving everywhere from the mud. If it weren't for this scene, it would be too strange. The strange blue light is like the legendary salvation light that makes everything recover. The area covered by blue light has a radius of hundreds of meters. Now the hundreds of meters of ground seems to suddenly become the legendary secluded hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please rest assured. Your presence is not in use. The Necromancer is here to help us." Roland shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? This is for us..." Geffenhardt looked up at the sky. It is amazement and shock that the color of fear in the eyes slowly dissipates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three necromancers in midair looked at the blue radiance of the resurrection of countless bodies. Nobinonot’s snoring smiled: “But is it a big scene of a corpse that has been used to make a giant corpse with a natural disaster?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it's just a small half of the force." The golden mask faintly answered. "Do you think that I am going to use your eagle to borrow your eagle to deal with your gargoyle? This stuff should be better than the gargoyle but I don't want to go underground. I only have to do business in this life. I can be very careful. Because I know these people are very treacherous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nopolinot sighed and shook his head and said, "You are wrong. In fact, the merchant is It’s the least treacherous. It’s just like to put the interests on the surface. In fact, who is alive is not for the benefit? It’s a bit deeper. Even things like emotional beliefs are not good for themselves. Those who are in the heart The talents who see the unreasonable abacus are real treacherous. Do you think that my straightforward talent is the most candid person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden 骷髅The mask nodded and said, "Oh? That's good. Let me see what kind of tricks you will play with the most outspoken people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All active corpses on the ground They all gathered together. These shapes vary in size from solid to liquid and constantly overlap. Squeeze and creep. Slowly squeezed out a shape similar to a gargoyle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This corpse monster stood up and shook up the numerous wings of the bloody small limbs and the mud of the condensed mud. The smell of death and decay is filled with this area. Even the devil in hell has no such horrible breath and power. Whether it is birds, beasts or insects, the surrounding sights are desperately trying to escape this breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This living corpse is probably not the five gargoyles to deal with. Maybe fifty?" Nopolinot smiled. "Don't you say that you are just a living corpse?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden mask sneer: "Do you have a problem with your eyes? Isn't this one or two?" As long as you can make it seriously injured, even if you win it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat necromancer still shakes his head: "So the person who intends to take the disc in his heart is actually It is the most treacherous. How do you want my gargoyle to be seriously injured by this monster? No. How can I use the spell? Otherwise, there is nothing to beat this gambling."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One of the reasons I hate being a guy who buys and sells is that they always like to bargain for a bargain. But it’s not just to make some elements of your three-legged cats. In the eyes." The golden mask touched the body and brought out a huge stench of wind and rushed toward the five stone ghosts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is not commensurate with the huge body. The body of the corpse is more than a stone ghost. The flight of more than one grade crashes into the arms of a gargoyle, like the most intimate lover, holding his limbs tightly. A huge but crisp cracking sound of the hard obsidian body was broken like a glass in the carrion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is as expected by the Necromancer. It’s just a little bit of a fight that the body of the giant stone is destroyed by the body. No matter how well-made instruments are made, there is no great power in life itself. This was provoked by the corpse of the corpse, so the hidden power of the corpse is not long, but as long as it can move, it is not a stone that can withstand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time, the other four gargoyles’ claws hit the body of the corpse. Although the carrion spattered, the flesh pieces that flew out were almost immediately reattached back to the body of the body. It seems that the effect of this common way of attack is really small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Boom’ is a muffled sound. A huge flame appeared in the air out of the air to wrap the gargoyle and the corpse together. Nopolinot finally shot. A shot is the high-level spell hell fire of the fire system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four gargoyles were hidden in the flames and their obsidian body was immune to the flames. And this seems to be the only reason that Nopolinot asked himself to shoot. Only magic cooperation is the only way to deal with this kind of corpse. Whether it is magic or gargoyle attack, it actually consumes the magical power of this corpse monster and such a large area of ​​burning is undoubtedly the most effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four Necromancers in midair did not even move their brows. Everyone was watching the battlefield without squinting. Nopolino's mourning of the mantra while operating the remaining four gargoyles seemed to be a little fussy. The Necromancer wearing a golden skull mask on the eagle is a lot easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is just a lot easier. After all, making such a huge corpse is not an easy task, but now his operation is much easier than Nopolino, but it still takes effort and attention. Everyone knows this, especially the Master Eden who floats in midair. This is exactly what he hopes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Master Eden is apathy and calm, but the hand holding the reel behind him has already had some muscles because of tension. This reel was when he was out of the Descarte Valley and the agent of the guild was hard-pressed to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like other top magicians, Aiden Master does not bring any magic scrolls on his body. Even a high-level magic such as a thundering bomb is thrown out of his hand and is not much slower than a reel. The key is that self-esteem as the top 6 caster does not allow the chef to carry the recipe with him. But when he left the Descartes Valley, Hamm asked him to bring a few more special battle reels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Aiden was originally very disdainful. However, the acting president said: "Even if I ask the master to help me with you, take it with you." So Master Aiden only frowned and accepted it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this encounter appears. When Master Aiden thought that there might be a chance to use the scrolls, there was also a fear of the agent's president. The appearance of this person cannot be arranged by him, but it can only be what he expected. Aiden has always been too small to see the acting president in his eyes. This is nothing but a hairy boy. No matter whether it is magic repair or doing things, there seems to be no surprise. Being a proxy president is just a matter of luck. It just happened to solve Ronis and this title has no substantive effect. But until this time he only appeared. The thoughtfulness of this man’s mind was so unexpected that he could not even predict himself. The key is that he usually does not show the deep dew. This kind of deep cooperation with such a mind can not help people feel a little creepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these thoughts are just a flash in his heart, after all, what is going to be solved is the opponent in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three of them are very clear that the other person will never be the opponent of their own three. But they also know that if they really want to fight against each other, even if they can kill each other. But you must die at least one or two on your side. And no one wants to be one of them, so they don’t dare to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But don't want to fight, don't want to do it. Many times, changing one or more ways is also a good or even more effective option. This is also the specialty of a long-lived old tycoon. Aiden’s suggestion was to make such a bet on the head of the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the level of the magician of the opponent, any fluctuations in the magical power before the magic attack will not be the other side. The use of reels in this case is undoubtedly the best. This scroll is also the reel of the most effective paralysis of this single but powerful group of opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the original idea, Master Aiden wanted to let the opponent operate the large eagle sitting down to the ground but couldn’t think of the opponent actually making a huge corpse . But then Nopodnot immediately hit the snake with the stick. I have raised the conditions that I can also use magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no tacit understanding in the past, Master Aiden believes that the look he turned back can already convey enough meaning. This is a common understanding between the old and the ardent people who are also deep-minded. The intentions of each other are all enough to convey in this look. Master Aiden believes that he only needs to take his own shot. It will never be just a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This opponent actually created such a savvy living corpse at the beginning, and most of the opponents are still somewhat wary. As long as there is such a big guy who is comparable to the behemoth beast, there is a monster like this in the three people. In addition to the master of Aiden, one person can fully take advantage of the flexibility. The other two are afraid that if they are slightly exposed, they will immediately Will attract attacks. And this kind of monster, even the top-level single attack magic, can't be defeated at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blink of an eye is enough to kill a hundred times. And once the operator loses the corpse, it will not break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle in midair has reached a feverish level. Although they cooperated with each other, Nobel Polino also gave the gargoyle a supplementary magic. However, the difference in strength is an irreparable living corpse, and it is a blow to smash the third body of the gargoyle. But Nopolino's three ices also hit the body of the body. A large area on the body of the corpse was covered with a layer of ice and hoarfrost. The other two squid's claws also slammed into these frozen places. Immediately, a piece of frozen black body fell to the ground and could no longer be attached to the body of the body. After this battle, Nopollinot seems to have finally achieved the most effective way to deal with this monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the necromancer with the golden mask is not nervous at all, but yawns leisurely. Because the outcome has already been obvious. Although the opponent slowly found the right tactics, there are only two gargoyles left and the victory is already in sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nopolino is not willing to give up and still directs two gargoyles to work hard with the corpse. Just no longer dare to let the gargoyle close to the corpse in exchange for a chance to attack with a gargoyle. The magic in Nopolinot's hands is no longer just the water system, but the fireball lightning and the bullets. Although these magics continue to blow up a piece of carrion and bones on the body of the body, it seems to be just a cup of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic keeps killing and bombarding the carrion. The air is full of magical elements and the sinuous waves that are blown up by the body. The gargoyles and cockroaches attached to the blast are added. Flying in midair, you chasing me like a three huge strange bat rolling up the airflow to make people's skin hurt. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Aiden knows that his chance to shoot is at this time his hand suddenly pulls out the magic scroll from behind and has burst open the white magic. Almost at the same time, Nopolino Nott’s hand that had been casting spells on the corpse also turned to the Necromancer who had a golden skull mask on the eagle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Aiden can feel the paralysis of white magic in his hand has already formed and will immediately swarm. But at this time he also felt a strange creep in his hair. This is being held behind by a knife. And I feel that the muscles on the hand holding the knife are shrinking and tightening, and the kind of creep that is going to be sent forward immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it’s the thrilling battle between life and death that happened several times in the past year and the intuition that he was buried in the years has returned to his instinct. When I was young, I was still a keen instinct for fighting and death on the battlefield, so he was the first of the three to feel wrong. He didn't even have time to complete the reel that was left in the blink of an eye, but suddenly turned around and shook away to sway a wall of wind to stop behind. At the same time, shouting in the mouth: "Be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the most swift cockroach can't be like him, from being completely still, getting high and hiding from him The wind wall in your hand is enough to withstand the strongest arrow. Fortunately, the little shadow was so slow after breaking through the wind wall that it just flew past his nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After such a distance, Aiden saw that this little shadow was a hummingbird. However, it is obviously impossible to be an ordinary peak bird. Because the hummingbird cannot fly so high, it is impossible to have such a fast degree. The key to this is that it is impossible to have such a strong carrion. The smell was as thick as the smelly mud that was poured into a bucket of gutters in the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hummingbird who fell in the air quickly drawn an arc in the air and returned to continue to rush to Aydin Mage. But this time halfway to meet it is countless small but The precision wind blade like a meat grinder instantly cuts it into countless pieces and then blows the pieces of minced meat without a trace. At this time, the stunned Master Eden was free to see his two companions because he knew there was no reason for such an attack to target him alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer who used Soul Magic reacted a little slower until he was awakened by the reminder of Master Eden. But his luck is also the best. He also flies from his back to his other black shadow than the attack on Aiden’s master. The magic that he condenses in his hand seems to be hesitant and does not face the opposite. The mage attack is just used to protect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Aiden shouted that the body of the Necromancer had not had time to move his head and did not return. He just had a cry and had arrived at the back of his small one less than a meter. Cracked open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is almost no physical attack power in Soul Magic, but this rushing out of the purest magical volatility still shreds the little black point that was already very fragile. Only the sharp feelings and attack methods of soul magic can attack this attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
