			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This knife raises the blood of the knife that is constantly beating. It has already risen and condensed. It is already a huge blood knife with a length of more than two meters. . There is no trace of blood in the air. All the spirits and strengths have been condensed into the blade and even a trace of bloody smell is reluctant to release. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small branches and leaves on the surrounding trees just started to smash and break. Even the white mage robes of Master Aiden began to scatter under this momentum. This knife is absolutely Asa's full force and strength is already impeccable. Master Aiden’s body has been completely evasive since he has not had time to rush to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unarmed magician, no matter what kind of magician, no matter what kind of magic is used to resist the fragile ** under such a blow There is no difference between the worms under the knives and the knives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this knife is not the master of Aiden because the one who has two heads in the head is really no need for him. The Tamik Knight behind the master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tamik Knight, like a ghost, emerged from a tree not far away, and the body and movements were not brought out. On the other hand, the head of Master Eden is divided into two pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His movements are very casual, just like opening a leaf, and he seems to think that the whole action is not murderous or even watching. The air magic master who was cut by him. His eyes are now only looking at one thing, that is, he has just fallen into the leaves of the world tree in the hands of Master Aiden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just watching. His hand has stretched out. This was originally his goal. This air magician is sure to kill Tamik. He just saw his movements and know that letting such a person take the world tree leaves on the sky, then there is absolutely no hope, so he first took him, not to mention that he has already helped. I took the leaves of the world tree by myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His hand is only three inches away from the leaves of the world tree, and he can already touch the leaf, but he has to shrink back. Because even if you get the leaves, it is meaningless to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge blood knife has reached less than three meters above the Tamik Knight. The Tamik Knight can feel that countless cells on his head have begun to crack under this momentum. The surrounding air is dying in the violent staggered collision. The murderous atmosphere and strength of this knife are combined with the perfection of the essence of the gods. The Tamek Knight can be sure that even if he or even Lancelot can not hit such a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely can’t beat. It’s absolutely impossible to avoid it. Therefore, he only resisted the full resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tamik Knight has a layer of gray radiance that has risen to the limit. The black fangs in the hand screamed like a goblin was killed in the asshole, and the horror was so terrible that the knife was plucked with a black mist. Just like the huge knife-shaped shape of the blood, it instantly became a black smog knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Aiden also split his body silently in midair. Even the blade has not touched him. He is now just a decorative device and the body becomes half-flying. Behind him, Tamik Knight raised his knife. Hold the black knife and clench your hands with both hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bang was not very loud but it was dull. It seems that some people buried hundreds of tons of gunpowder in the depths of the ground and detonated it. The blood-condensed knives hit the black knives. The trees within ten meters of the impact point were shaken and then collapsed silently. The air waves generated by the subsequent impacts picked up the wood chips and the soil on the ground. Sprinkle down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody fog that bursts in the sky was originally condensed around the black long knife. The black light actually shattered into countless small pieces like a shape. At the same time, there was also the gray figure of the Tamik Knight, but his figure flew more quickly and brought a bloody rain in the air. It was the blood that was ejected from his mouth. It was not only big but also rushed as if he had flown out of the recoil of this blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the Tamik Knight has been hanging on the trunk of a towering tree in the distance before stopping the impact of the sawdust. rain. The Tamik Knight slipped from the pit and vomited a large amount of blood. The black fangs in his hand had a crack in the silk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew that the other side’s blow was a full blow at the expense of self-harm. It was also seen that it was not an easy offensive but it was not until after this resistance that he understood that there was more and more difficulty in this fight. Without hesitation, he turned and flew toward the road. He knew that he was no longer able to fight again. A few speeding his figure disappeared between the old trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of the mud and dust from this attack slowly dissipated to reveal a crumbling figure in the middle of the knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamik Knight is just unable to fight again but Asa is almost unable to stand anymore. Just when he stabbed his blood-sucking squeegee into his body, he almost pulled out his internal organs all over the short time. This self-mutilation method was used twice, especially the last time it was critical. It’s great to use his full strength and stand still now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he has already seen the trace of the Tamik Knight. Although the sneak martial arts of this shrine knight is far from home, even more so than his own, but Asa still noticed him. The key is that the thunderous bombs of the two blocks of Aiden’s masters are not to mention that the shrine knight will be noticed even if it is a pig, so Asa knows that he will always come to pay attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost certainly not aware of any sounds and sounds, but Asa knows when there is a bloody smell in the air and a unique murderousness. The Knights of the Temple have been lurking. After the battle, the Tamik knight, who was injured and beaten with fighting spirit and killing, could not fully maintain his mentality, so Asa could detect it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it was noticed, Asa did not have a voice or a look of alert. The reason is very simple. A person who thinks that he is a squirrel is definitely the best person to be a beggar. In this case, Master Aiden should be the priority of the choice of the attacker of the Tamik Knight. No matter who knows his flight, he will know that letting such a person take the world tree leaves, there is absolutely no chance. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Asa wouldn’t start with Master Aiden and let him go to the leaves of the world tree. He knows that when he gets it, he is dead. It’s time to shoot for yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very dangerous*. If the Tamek Knight is not shooting at Aydin Master or the two have a tacit understanding or the patience of the Tamik Knight can be better, so that Asa himself must first take the shot, the Asa will die. But the result is that after all, Asa gambled and he finally got a squash to hit a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he has to admit that the strength of the Shrine Knight is really deep and almost reached the point where he is almost the same as Lancelot. A knife can not be killed on the spot. Most of the lethality and killing of the blow were dispelled by the Tamik Knight. Instead, he himself was almost climbed down by the power of anti-shock and counter-attack. Fortunately, the Tamik Knight turned around and fortunately this is in the whispering of the Sun, the fluctuations of the Sun Well are gradually strengthening. He is only slowly adjusting between a few breaths. After using his own breath, he used the healing spells to slowly recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves of the world tree and the two pieces of jade that have been sealed with magic are flying out with the two bodies of Master Aiden’s body. It was only a relief when it was collected. Looking at half of the body of half of Aiden’s body, the incomplete face still retains the ecstasy expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have reminded you why you don't pay attention to it..." Asa sighed and finally glanced at the big 6 strongest air magic. The body of the teacher shook his head and walked away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luya has been stiff and has been attacked by the violent waves of the two men who have just played and lie out on the ground. Asa just went up to help her untie her own slamming Just got up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you okay? The leaves of the world tree?" Seeing the world tree in the hands of Asa, Luya took it and saw Asa another. The two jade faces on one hand completely relaxed. At the same time, there was more unrecognizable excitement on her face. Her hands were holding Asa’s shoulders. The body suddenly swayed, but I thought about it and didn’t blush. I seemed to think about it with a very serious expression. Looking at Asa said: "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flapping sound from above. Asa looked up and saw a winged Pegasus wrapped in a blue spherical water curtain falling down Ai Mei and a blue robe female mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Asa Big Brother." Ai Yimei did not wait for the Pegasus to land directly from the top and jumped down the water curtain without blocking her directly. Flying over and rushing straight into Asa’s arms, he hugged him and almost knocked Lucia next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
