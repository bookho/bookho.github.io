			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa Huaizhong took the appointment document that Bishop Ronis had just handed him to the Duke’s Mansion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he still wore the dirty robes that Sandru gave him, he is now a patrol officer authorized by the bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course this is not true in the bureaucratic system of the official empire without this position. To put it directly, he can only be regarded as a clergyman who is sent by the bishops to the local church for inspections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you want to say something, then he is the imperial minister of the bishop. He has the right to command all church affairs in the place where he goes. Bishop Ronis probably didn't think about letting him really command the affairs of the church. He also saw that he had no such interest at all. He just hoped that the deterrent effect of this official title would be more convenient when he was acting at the local level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the benefits of such a position? Asa thought about it. He never thought about what kind of status to command, and never thought that he would have the right to go on the road. This is not the kind of kind of waste that I dare not expect, so I don’t think about it, and I’m not interested in seeing a dog’s big bones like a cow and a sheep. When Bishop Roones said that he was to be awarded him, he wanted to say that he did not believe that God did not want to do any clergy, but he did not dare to say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now that you have such a power, you have to consider the quality of this. Even if it is only a priesthood of the church, it will probably be very powerful in practical use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to eat, you don’t have to worry about it. If you go to the local town, you can go to church to eat and eat. You don’t have to be hungry in the pub like you are in Airy. . I thought for a long time that Asa only came to such a conclusion. Probably this thing is not a complete waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now go to the Duke’s House to find out where Klis’s whereabouts are and then immediately. I don't know where the dead woman ran far away. If it was too far, it would be difficult to do it now. I have just forgotten to state to the bishops that this economic difficulty cannot always go back to ask for money. I thought of the trusting eyes and attitude of the bishop. Asa immediately felt that even if she climbed, she would climb to Criss to get the book back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to go to the Duke to borrow? How do you speak? There was nothing to pledge this time, and I was thinking about it and I went back to the Dukes House. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s House is a little bit of a duke temperament that is not a surprise anger. Although I saw that Asa was picked up by the bishop's carriage, but was not scared by the meaning of this treatment, he still wanted him to wait at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke adults came out to meet. Of course, the face is still a very pure smile. No matter whether you have any observation or no observation, you will never feel the slightest impurity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not bother to ask questions about Chris immediately. The bishop said that this matter must be handled naturally and cannot reveal the slightest trace. If you can't open your mouth, ask what you want to mention in your chat and then pretend to suddenly wake up and say that you have something to be taken away by Christ. It is something that you need to use now. It must be brought back as soon as possible. I don’t know how to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Should be better?" Asa began this topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s still not awake but the face is already a lot better. It looks like it’s just a normal sleep. I think it’s better to let her rest. When he wakes up, he will naturally wake up. Are you going to see her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not let her rest well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence for a moment Asa’s own language is really stretched when dealing with people. He is a little anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke is now sure that Asa does not have any mysterious behind-the-scenes identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master of the official masters of social communication, the master of the social entertainment, the manner in which each person speaks, the temperament of each subtle movement represents the life of this person. The educational mood and even the ability and character of the environment can be clearly distinguished. Just like the old butcher can see the blood of the knife under the knife at a glance. This is the unique vision of every expert who hones his skills into art in his own way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Young people talk to me in the study room?” The Duke’s approach to dealing with people is that his unique art is not in a hurry to show his true intentions so that everything looks so natural. He just let Klauvis leave the Duke's House and only contacted the two when they were alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good." Asa nodded in no time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coming to the duke’s study. Asa was amazed at the full house shelves and books and gave the Duke an admiration. People who don't read books very much have an inexplicable tribute to those who can read books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really don't know how to express my gratitude to you." The Duke pulled Asa's tone and expression in tandem. "You have saved my daughter twice and twice. This kind of favor is that I have to repay anyway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is not too embarrassed. He shook his head and said, "This is what I should do. It’s not a big deal. It’s just a small friend who is my friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You say no matter what Whatever it is, as long as I have the ability to do it, I will try my best to help you." The Duke expressed his gratitude very sincerely. "If you are interested in exhibiting on the official career, I will give you all the support. You will be able to make progress with your talents. Although I know that such a way of thanking is really cheesy, I can't think of other methods."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need me to be interested in these."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A complete answer. The personality of this young man was known early. The duke pretends to sigh and say: "You are probably not the only one who has really lived in this world. The power is the most useful and indispensable thing in the world of this relationship and system." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe you are too young to be energetic and want to go to the world to ignore the world's fame and fortune. It is the same as when I was young." I took a very hearty laugh at the shoulders of Asa’s shoulders. "I like the character like you very much." To let others treat you as a friend, you must first treat others as friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke seems to have just chatted with Asa for immediate interest. In the speech, neither the smell of deliberately making a scent is revealed, and the intimacy and interest can be expressed. The content of the tone of discourse is loosely blended into a subtle temperament that fully expresses what the Duke wants to make others feel. It is a very pleasant thing to talk to someone like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a stepping up. As long as people have a good impression, they can gradually further and then see each other’s personality preferences and even ** also have the opportunity to build a deeper Emotional connection. Everything must go through nature. Once someone else sees your intentions, it will only be counterproductive. This is a very good work, but it is also the Duke's masterpiece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Asa did not feel the wonderful performance of the Duke. He always thought about how to ask the Duke adults about Klis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke is preparing to further deepen the topic and suddenly a rush of footsteps interrupted his thinking. A man went into the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke knows the quality of the people in his house. He has already ordered not to be close to the study, and this man will dare to run in such a panic. A very important thing. He frowned and asked: "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This next person wants to go to the duke’s ear to quietly report the Duke’s wave: “That’s it.” In this case, naturally, Asa could not be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was a message from the fast horse that the caravan where Miss Cris was located was looted in the western border. Miss was also taken away as a hostage for a ransom. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke's face changed slightly. Surprised and happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever your daughter is kidnapped, anyone will be surprised. But he immediately saw that Asa’s face was more powerful than he was, and he was almost shocked. He immediately smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big ear monsters are just some of the cowards who are mercenary and should not dare to hurt a Duke’s daughter. And this is obviously a panic that can't help but is more valuable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really good news in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Kravis is in the house of his uncle prime minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hates coming here very often. Although the family of the Elni family has always been his father, since the new emperor entrusted his uncle to the prime minister two years ago, there have been rumors that he will re-elect a family member. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Duke’s adult rushed back from the horse, he said that he would temporarily avoid it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows what the Duke meant. He also saw that Asa was taken over by the bishop's carriage and the Duke could see that he hated Asa so he was asked to avoid it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that this is a must in communication and he should really go away but he is still very angry. This shows that he is not as important in that aspect of the Duke's eyes. Now he has risen to a kind of hostility to Asa from the original hate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked into a room. He immediately saw the big bed in the middle. The bed was so prominent that it was afraid that others would not know that the house was used for sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bed is big enough for ten people to sleep on the high-grade fabric used on the bed. It needs a hundred ordinary people to work for a year before they can afford it. It is stuffed with cotton and goose down. It must be comfortable to sleep on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis is never going to sleep on such a bed. He feels that once people rest too comfortable, they will loosen their spirits and relax. And spending energy on these enjoyments is undoubtedly a symbol of waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if the waste is used properly, it can still play a considerable role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waste on the bed was lying naked in the middle of a few women hanging a few lines and saw that Klauvis came in and was a little surprised. "It’s a rare visitor who hasn’t seen you for a long time.” He had an iron shelf on his face because his face was smashed two months ago until he has not fully recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pinched the few women next to him and pointed to Clause. "This is the most promising and busy person in our younger generation. It’s all about the country’s big things all day long. What’s going on? You guys have the ability to get him into bed and come back and tell me that he’s on top. I was greatly rewarded when I was like it." Then I watched Carlos squeezing and squinting. "Do you want to try it? They have a lot of good work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow can you really? Handsome, handsome and handsome." Several women Watching Crowes's laughter like watching a crisp apple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis even the corners of the eye have not given alms to the past ** in his opinion is just the pork on the chopping board is boring. He stared indifferently at the face under the iron shelf and said, "I am here to tell you something. The guy who injured you last time is back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The waste popped up from the pillow and ** and shouted: "Is it? I am looking for him everywhere. Give me a call." He snorted and suddenly seemed to calm down and stared in confusion. Clause. "You told me what to do? The last time you told me. It won't be you who want to deal with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that at least the brain has not yet I completely know that I want to do things. Clovis's face, even the smallest hair, did not shake, still the indifferent expression said coldly: "I am here to tell you that you better see him and don't go to trouble. Just by you Probably still can't move him, but he has a relationship with the bishop. I don't want to see our family and the bishops are unhappy, so come and remind you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The face suddenly twitched and turned to the expression of eating people. With the eyes of an irritated dog, Klauvis snarled in disgust: "I have to do something that you don't need to teach." I warn you not to care about me." He walked out of bed and a few women hurry up to help him put on his clothes and comb his little scorpion. That is his favorite style that he most likes to have personality. He once exposed the scalp of a person who dared to comb this head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis still looked at him without any expression. He turned his head and slammed Klauvis with a glance and said: "If you are not convinced, you will call your old man to be a prime minister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
