			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of the Duke is listening to the report of his spy in the School of Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s eldest daughter has just been promoted to the assistant finance minister. The younger daughter is about to become the emperor. Now he is unbeatable in the empire regardless of the momentum or strength. But now the Duke is a face of dignity listening to the report of the spy. Contrary to his recent Qingyun straight, he is now in full swing. Because he received a letter a few days ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accurately, he did not receive it but he did. The person who wrote the letter was written by the Bishop of Ronis, who was the owner of the city of Oufu, Cedrus. Under a very coincidence, the Duke’s spy at the School of Magic got the errand of the delivery. He naturally sent the letter to the Duke’s hand first. When the Duke opened the letter and saw his self-control and cultivation, he was immediately shocked. Bishop Rooney said in the letter that the Duke had already won the political struggle in the empire but it was a matter of time before the ambition of the man to seize the throne. And if such a person really sits on the throne, it is a threat to every country around him, so it is best to deal with him when he is just getting started. Asked Sedros to bring the Duke’s previous letters with him and all the evidence he had worked with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The friendship between the Duke and Cedros began only six or seven years ago. He was not very clear about the university's previous situation. He never thought that he and Bishop Ronis were old-fashioned. From this letter, it seems that Bishop Ronis should have known that he had assisted Cedrus in establishing Oufu in secret. However, he did not show any slight reaction. The old man’s heart was so deep that the Duke could not sigh. And now he has to start with a shot that is almost a fatal blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Cedros is his own friend but the same person who is doing great things, the Duke knows that there is never any friendship that can rival a strong relationship. Cedros also knows what kind of person he is. The words on this letter are not even alarmist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the letter is really delivered, then the consequences are absolutely unimaginable. Now he must spend all his energy on how to deal with this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the key to the high weight of Bishop Ronis is that his relationship with prestige and status makes the ordinary means completely ineffective. The soldiers are in danger. The Duke’s careful eye-drops around the School of Magic closely watched the bishop of Ronis and the people associated with him to wait for an opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the king’s transmission magic array, Asa did not stop at all. I heard that the Crowes’s troops did not seem to have returned immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the direction of Airy, only three or four days of the night, Asa finally got in the station and now Rodehart and Clauses escorted The team of prisoners. He did not appear rashly but quietly went to find Rod Hart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt looking at the book under the lamp was amazed at his appearance. "You have come too soon. Has Ali's work been handled? I haven't received any news from the troops, so I am in a hurry. I can't think of you but I have caught up."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is your situation here? Are your brothers no longer working on your fellow villagers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt Shake his head. "He has indeed fixed us all, so there is no need to force me to do it again. On this road, I have no abnormal behavior except for the extent of slowing down the team. I want him to think that I really have no way to go. Let him be at the mercy, so he relaxed a lot of my vigilance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa asked: "Have you discussed this with your folks?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt shook his head and replied: "It is impossible for him to relax and never give me this opportunity. How can I let other soldiers present me?" Go and talk to your prisoner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want me to catch up with?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;?;&nbsp;Rodhardt pressed the already very low voice and said: "No matter whether it is the officials of Airy or the soldiers here, they are not very clear about the details. They only know that they are going to take prisoners." Bring the king back to the trial. So as long as it is for me to lead the team back to the king, not Klaus, I have a way to put this The matter was solved perfectly." He patted Asa’s hand and said, "No matter what reason or method you can use, as long as you can separate my brother from the team and trap him for at least half a day, of course, the longer the better. I can take the team away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not easy. How to get rid of Clavis is the most important issue. He is a thoughtful and intelligent person. Since we have the heart to guard against us, we will never be so easy on our trap. I have until now I haven't found his flaws yet..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa just frowned and thought about it and immediately nodded and said: "Good morning, I will let him leave the team." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt stunned. "Do you have a way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured. I don't think there is anything I can do difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So it’s best to wait until the team is away from the station and you take him away so I have reason to continue to move forward with the team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Good." Asa suddenly remembered to say to Rod Hart. "Crowvis, the guy, just beware of you, you are going to take him away now to see how those people are caught."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After thinking about it, it seems that he hesitated, and Rod Hart nodded. "Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Asa sneaked into the shed of the prisoner with the help of Rod Hart. He easily stunned the guards and didn't worry that they would report to Clause tomorrow. As long as the detained person does not run, it does not matter that no one will take the initiative to report an inexplicable accident to a violent and cruel officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The folks of Rod Hart are very excited to see Asa appear. But what surprised Asa was that although they had not been in contact with Rod Hart, it seemed that they had already figured out the truth of the matter. The hunter Levin is still alive. It is he who told the story to others that everyone talked to each other and talked with the guardian soldiers to get a rough idea. Now listen to Asa and give them a talk and understand what is going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have already discussed how we will not sell you both after the arrival of the king." Hunter’s eyes have already licked his body. They can't move anymore, but he can still say that he can listen. He is still the leader in this group of people. "Our life is how you can betrayed by both of you. We are very happy that Ronald can have such a status today. Anyway, we will fall to the hands of those dog officials. We will die sooner or later. We would rather die than never commit suicide." Tired of him. Only pity the children..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked at the group of children who were less than ten years old and also did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are young and ignorant, they may leak news when we have to..." Hunter Levin’s voice choked his eyes and now it’s just two holes but next to it There is already a mother who is crying down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I am here to tell you that we will definitely save you. At noon tomorrow, Rod Hart will lead the team forward as long as the king is He has a way to save you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa doesn't know what Rohart has to do, but since he said it must be done. He smiled at the children there and patted them and whispered, "You will wait for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second At noon, Asa appeared in front of the team as promised by Rod Hart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a surprise to see Crovis in front of him alone. Rodhart naturally has to be surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sorcerer's original action is so fast?" Crowvis stared at Asa slowly. "You care about us so much. We just want to chase it. Just don't know if Ali's pagans have already been solved? That is the errand that the Emperor and the Bishop have delivered to you..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s been done long ago.” Asa also stared back at the smile on his face, all ridiculed and confident. "I also went back to the king to play for a few days. Do you want to know what I have done in the king these days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The official is really good. Interesting..." Clavis’ eyes narrowed and glanced at Asa. He is very sure that the situation is that he has an advantage. He couldn’t figure out where the smashed expression on the face of the chopped face was coming from. "I don't know what God officials have done in the king..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression on the face of Clavis solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is very loud. Most of the people in the team can hear it clearly. Suddenly the crowds shook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of unclear things between the nobles, but they dare to shout out like this and never heard of it. There are also a few followers from the team that Carlos brought from the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s heart is inexplicably painful. Although he intended to provoke Klauvis to make him feel uncomfortable. But at the time when the words "your wife" came out of their mouths, the chest was like a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know? She actually hates you very much." Asa’s voice grew louder and louder. "If it's not because of your family's shit name, do you think you are married to him? In her mind you don't even have a cold hair for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you think I insulted you if you are not convinced, I have chosen a place to solve our problems privately." Asa reached out to Klauvis. "Do you dare to come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt looked at Asaph with a stunned look and thought about it. Asa actually used this method. This is no longer a trick to compromise, but to fight for you to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauves’s blue veins on his forehead are so fierce that he has to break through the skin. A golden head is windless and automatic. The soldiers just watched him now that everyone has dared to keep his eyes on him. But just as the anger on his face was about to break his expression, he suddenly began to laugh and laugh more than just crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then his laughter suddenly stopped. He nodded: "Okay. I accept your challenge. I will go with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis turned to Rodhart and said: "Rodhart If the adults are completely handed over to you as you wish, you will take them first." He showed a smile and it was all embarrassing. "You take them to hurry, don't let down the beauty of the priests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt greeted his eyes coldly. Nod and then looked at Asa and sighed. "Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis left Asa with the team. The team continued to move forward under the leadership of Rod Hart and disappeared into sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two remaining people, Clause, followed Asa in the opposite direction. Neither of them was snoring along the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took. At the junction of a meadow and a grove, Clovis stopped. "It's here. You don't have to go far. Anyway, your purpose has been reached."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa turned and saw Clauses laughing. It seems that from the beginning of the team he has been hanging this expression that is very rare for him. Asa frowned and asked: "You seem to be very happy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course I am happy. Because I can just kill you by name." Clausues still The beast that laughs like a fierce and extravagant blood is calling. His eyes were sharp and sharp like a needle that had been punctured. "I didn't bother to pay attention to Rod Hart's kid. He wants to do whatever he wants. The Duke holding these people is for the two of you to have to accept the Bishop of Ronis. This may indeed be the biggest political interest in this matter. But for me it is far less enjoyable than killing you. I used to have a chance, but the yin and yang have let you run away. This time you actually took the initiative to provoke you and I have a legitimate reason."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I won't forget that I am so happy today because I have to kill you personally." Clovis's hand rested on the hilt of his waist. "I know that you want to delay the kid's time. Don't worry. As a reward for your own door, I will let you do it. I promise to spend a whole day here to kill you slowly. Absolutely killing wonderfully You can't forget it in hell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha" Asa is laughing too. "Tell you as if you really have a chance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his smile only lasted for the moment of Clovis's sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Rod Hart’s evaluation of Clauses has always been high, Asa does not agree. He has always believed that a person's ability can be seen from his character. The extraordinary broad chest of the temperament is often the proof of ability. For example, like General Gru, like Shandru. And how high can a small person like Crowes who is narrow-minded and sinister? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it wasn't until Klauvis's hand waved his body that Asa knew that he was wrong and that he was very wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis is not a sword but a big river. A bright and incomparable seems to have gathered all the majestic from the sky for a hundred years and then flows eastward to the sea. The impassion is to drown all the things in front of the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword of the Qijiang River, he once saw that it was stabbed from behind in a night in Wangdu. He thought that the sneak attack was the Duke of Mulak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he completely missed the Duke’s deep and old-fashioned plan. Even if he really wants to kill, he will never do it himself. If he can figure this out at the time, then this time he will never be so rashly provocative. At least the weapon must be taken, but now he is empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Clavis was just a handy sword at hand, but now it’s the most suitable and most capable of waving this Hit the mighty weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these are not the most terrible ones. Asa’s own spirit is lax and more deadly than unarmed and back-to-attack. The loss of wariness and fighting spirit made him fall into an absolute disadvantage. There is no choice but to withdraw him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword light in front of him is no longer a mean river and has evolved into a tsunami that has rushed to the horn. He has not even turned back. Retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are mediocre in all other places but there is an unparalleled talent in a single field. It is such a person. He really has a narrow mind and is too important to be a talented person or even a good person. But he is indeed a genius swordsman. As long as he has a sword in his hand, his talents and souls that can't be swayed elsewhere can immediately bloom with dazzling brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a top-notch swordsman, as long as you seize the opportunity, you must kill your opponent. Going to the opponent to take a move, even if only the opponent is injured and killed, it is the second and third-rate swordsman. The first sword of Clauses is a sword that must be killed to determine the victory and death of a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa continues to retreat as if he can destroy all the swords and swords in front of him. As long as his footsteps stop, he can completely devour him. Smash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He retreated into the back of the woods and the tsunami followed. The trees around him and the trees behind him collapsed. His body seems to be shrouded in an invisible but powerful lawn mower, but the trees seem to be all foamy and fragile. As he retreats, he continually breaks and blows away. He is so hard. A road was withdrawn from the woods. However, the Jianguang tsunami did not have any obstacles, but it was getting closer and closer to him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sword gas is only half a foot away from him. The head has begun to break the skin and can already feel the pain before tearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can't retreat, you will die. Asa suddenly stood up and shook all the spirit and strength together. With the spirit of a highly concentrated sword, the tsunami was reduced to a sword in his eyes. He gathered all the fighting spirits that can be condensed in the present situation and grabbed the sword that was devastating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s fingers and palms can feel the strength of the sword’s power, and the murderous swords are all in one, as long as they can feel the whole person of this sword. There will be another feeling: there is no such thing as a sword in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he did not hesitate without hesitation. If you are not sure, you have to pick up the murderousness and swordsmanship that will become his fighting spirit and the other side. That is the contest between strength and strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air between the palm and the sword has been compressed to the extreme. Just touch another person whoever dies and who wins and whoever wins can see it immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword is like a tsunami. Can a pair of naked hands grasp the tsunami? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know because the sword and tsunami suddenly disappeared. He only caught an empty space. The sword suddenly inexplicably smashed to the side and left its original track. Then the fierce swordsmanship of the sword disappeared from the sword. Just like a great painting, all the brushwork charms are perfect, but the last one is suddenly like a child's graffiti, and all the exquisiteness is completely scrapped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is incredible that Asa is shocked by this change. But even this shock is deadly. The sword has no sword and sword but there is still strength and strength. Although there is no longer a sweeping path, it is a weapon of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a moment of horror, the tip of the sword has broken the throat of his throat and will immediately cut into his throat and insert it into his cervical spine<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, there is no tactical trick. Only the instinct of Asa’s hand is put on the sword and slammed out while the body is desperately twisting towards the side. His neck spewed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Asa knew that he had won the tip of the sword and only cut his carotid artery and then he was taken up by his fingers. The fatal blood vessels around it are not fatal. It was only then that he was able to distract himself and saw the face of Clauses who had been in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a loser’s face that is angry and fearful. His sword has been pulled out of the sword. The old man has been in this short blink of an eye. He has completely lost his fighting power as a swordsman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa will never give him a chance to let him take the sword and set off another offensive. The other hand has already caught his wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cracking of the bones sounds so sweet for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand that was pulled back by the sword was again punched into the chest of Clovis. In the sound of the broken bones, he immediately flew out and flew out of the air like a broken kite and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa gasped a few mouthfuls and licked his neck and used healing to stop bleeding and listen to his heart pounding in the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as Jian Feng is on the top again, he is lying on the ground now. The reason why he was able to just open the sword was because the sword had touched the ring that had just arrived. Otherwise, the time that Jianfeng had cut into the rushed finger that had no fighting spirit protection might have been enough to cut his carotid artery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stepped forward and Crowvis lay on the ground and did not move blood from his nose and mouth. Asa gasped and watched as he shook his head and said, "I won't win if you win."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s a hard chance to win Crowes It is much bigger than Asa and even if he loses in the end, he will never lose so thoroughly. Asa will never win. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe he wants to win easily and has skills. Maybe he has seen Asa’s empty-handed sword and has concerns. According to his judgment, Asa finally should not be able to completely open the sword, but the last one was placed on the ring. This is indeed luck, but this luck comes from his choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too accustomed to not to solve things positively, too attached to the means, so I gave up when I was in the first place, I chose to use the hard touch despite the advantage. Take it easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of trying to win a relaxed and beautiful person is often the most thorough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis is still lying there without moving or wondering if it is fainting or dead or being hurt by a very heavy injury. Although people like him seem to die, it is not a bad thing. But then go up and make up two things as if Asa couldn't get it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa remembered that he did not know who said it and said to the Clause on the ground: "The character determines everything."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse that came to the place did not know where to go. Asa had to go on foot for five days and then returned to Wangdu. Go straight to the headquarters of the Paladin to find Rod Hart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the crowd there, it seems that the death penalty is being executed. The sound of the sickle falling down and the head and neck smashed off for a while, but the screaming seems to be somewhat unbearable but still cruel and happy. Asa did not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who watched the excitement started to go back six times. Pass to see the exclamation of the hilarious people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are a lot of people who can kill this time and there are children who are a bit miserable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
