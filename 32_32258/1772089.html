			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten days are over. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although knowing that he will soon be removed from the military power, the general is still holding the position to take over his position, but the military can continue to lead the battle. . He still tried his best to do what a general should do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, the various situations of the orc troops are still unclear. Most of the troops sent out to explore have found nothing. The general even began to send a vanguard of thousands of people to explore the real battle in the city of Oufu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is strongly opposed to only personally experienced, he knows how adventurous this action is purely death. And he knows what the strategy of Oufu means. This is in the delay time. Oufu never thought about going to war with the empire and not letting the opponent know his specific combat power. The other party would not dare to act rashly. The situation on the king's side is already obvious. The order to stop the war and retreat is only a matter of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa understands that his task is only a matter of time. As long as the Emperor's command is down, try not to let the generals send troops. So these days he worked hard to deal with the general's rich field life and combat experience with his own mouth that was not good at him. He always had something to say and was able to persuade the generals that he really experienced the amazing fighting power of the orcs. I have seen the high efficiency of Oufu under the rule of Cedrus. He analyzed the maneuver's mobility outside the wilderness and, most importantly, the vision that was not affected by darkness at night, which was a hundred times more sensitive than humans. This is exactly the same as when the generals used to annihilate those rigid orc tribes. The orcs will take the initiative to use all kinds of flexible methods to completely illuminate all their advantages. The concept of combat will be completely different. Moreover, it is necessary to count the Wyvern of the Wyvern. It can completely see the whereabouts of the troops at a height that the bow and arrow cannot reach. Under the condition of the enemy, I am only an uninterrupted sneak attack at night, which can make the morale of the troops devastated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general’s attitude towards him in the constant debate with Asa has gradually calmed down and even begun to show approval and admiration. Such a young man’s experience in both mind and battle is not commensurate with his age. As for his instincts in the military, he also sees that this young man is not ordinary. He did not eat or drink in the camp every day like other priests or discuss the abstract problems of theology with the pastors. This is undoubtedly a leader who is a leader. A natural fighter general has many times to ask why people like him do things under the Elni family but have no openings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger who passed the emperor’s will is finally here. Sure enough, the general’s military power was cut and he was no longer a general. Regarding the candidate for the new general, the military and the Elni family did not give each other a final result. Finally, the Duke of Mulak was finally recognized by the two ministers. He will come over shortly after receiving the military power emperor to order the general to wait for the Duke to come here. The general finally listened to the imperial edict and finally asked him: "Is the Duke of Mulak still taking the fight after he took over? It was he who led the troops to attack the orc city-state." "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty has decided to retreat. The envoys of all countries strongly urge Bishop Ronis to strongly admit that Oufu is an independent country. I heard that Ou Fu also sent messengers to discuss the peace treaty. This is not just that it may not be played now. The 40,000 army here is taken over by the Duke of Mulak and then distributed back to the southern frontier if necessary. Let half of the soldiers disarm and return to the field."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general was silent and then began to tremble slightly and tried very hard to say a few words: "Chairs." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asa was called out by the general at dusk. The general took him to the outside of Bracada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no other person around a small hill outside the city. The general watched the bloody red sunset for a while and then said: "I have seen these days as a real warrior. I want to talk to you now and leave aside. What political position is purely based on two fighters. The conversation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general looked at Asa with great strength and was full of regret and unwillingness. "Why are you going to succumb to the smoky politicians of the Elni family? You can see that only the real warrior has the temperament. It is only through the numerous life and death lines that have experienced the taste of death with their own hands and teeth. The power of the talents who walked over the opponent's blood and flesh under the feet. So how can you still endure the politicians who are as jealous as the pigs? When they play with the smoky intrigues, you are a real Don’t the warrior feel sick?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general was a little surprised to ask: "Bishop adult? What did he send you here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bishop told me to come here to ease the situation and wait for the truce."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s no wonder that you have been trying to stop me from sending troops during this time." The general did not have a fire. His energy seemed to have been exhausted by the imperial edict of today. "What about our soldiers after the armistice? We can fight to take advantage of our own flesh and blood to expand the country's territory and then take our own lives to guard. But the final result, once it is too peaceful, does not need us. It’s the politicians of the fly camp shit. The sword is a hostile means and a conspiracy. Those of us who are destined to fight on the front line can only be political tools. We can’t do the dirty things. Slowly being squeezed out of this country, it slowly falls into the hands of the aristocrats like the pigs who spend their days. Those who count on the pampered hands are not bound to the four-body, but they will not be apart from women and eat and drink. What? We can kill them with one finger and they are as light as a dead bug.” The general began to have angry light in his eyes. "Why do we still have to play with them why the land and glory that we exchanged for blood and flesh have been taken for by these people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa Silent. He could feel the ups and downs in the general's mind. Although he does not understand military politics, he can understand the anger of this old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general looked at Asa slowly and word by word: "I have a request for you. This is the first time I have asked for someone in my life. Is it possible for a warrior to ask for a warrior?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of power such as the general’s personality is probably the first in his life. Go to ask people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A request for an old man’s life. Can a general who directs tens of thousands of troops request such a request to reject it by means of equal recognition of the other party? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa almost promised it. But he did not forget the subtle environment and tasks of the present just saying: "Let's talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general silenced and said, "Are you not doing it? Read the sacred Only the two of us were present. The messenger quickly left after conveying the will. These are all specially arranged by me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? "Asa frowned. He is not familiar with these." "Why do you want to arrange that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one else heard the content of the sacred. It means that no one but us knows that I have no power to command the troops. You know why I am doing this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." Asa waited for him to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the team I have led for nearly two decades. I can say that each of them is my confidant. Just let them know that I have been deprived. I can still mobilize their military power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?" Asa frowned at the general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general’s voice slowly regained its vitality and power: “Tomorrow we will go all the way to the orc’s lair to kill. Just slap the nest in one fell swoop. Other countries in the plains have seen our military powers and naturally do not dare to say anything else that the Emperor’s Majesty will know that the maintenance of the country or the politicians of our military will also be timid and dare not to play any more.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa was surprised to see the general’s desperate situation has already made his anger and unwillingness to become a gambler’s fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is nothing to be scrupulous. History has always been a defeat in the kingdom. As long as we succeed, no one dares to say anything. Bishop Ronis will never Blame you. The head of Roland, who has no problem with the Paladin, is an old comrade who will fight with me for many years. I will secretly support us. As long as we work together, you can command the pastors and the troops to cooperate and kill those orcs. The film is not left. Our number is ten times that of them.” The general’s eyes began to shine as if victory was in sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I don't do it." Asa shook her head. "I told you that there is no good result in rushing to send troops. And the task I am here to stop is to stop you. I will go back and tell the other generals that your military power has been deprived."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the general's seemingly murderous eyes, Asa did not have the slightest fear. He just thought that the old man was a little pitiful. He shook his head and said, "Is the armistice not good? Who is in power? The soldiers also don't have to die to go home. It’s better to live in peace than to die here.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general’s voice seems to be roaring and screaming: “There is a death sooner or later. After being a soldier, it is better to die on the bed than to go back to farm and sell vegetables. It’s better to die on the battlefield.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa Still shaking his head is still so faint: "Even if you think that these tens of thousands of soldiers will not think that their loved ones will not think so. They all want to see their son or husband can live back. General is you Will your wife and children not want you to go back alive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general slowly pointed his finger at the west and the sunset was red like blood. His voice was actually shaking: "My wife and the last son died there and died in the hands of the orcs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Twenty-five years ago, my wife and a team of caravans were killed by the orcs through the wild land. I didn't even know the body. Where to find it.” The fortitude and mightyness of the general were gone, leaving only the trembling sorrow. Back to the sunset makes him look like a broken sculpture. "After more than half a year ago, my last son led a team of mercenaries to the depths of the highlands. The result of the reconnaissance was nothing. He was only 25 years old and a heroic warrior. It is definitely a great warrior and general. Do you know that? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa knows. In front of him, there was a heroic figure on the top of the barren hill facing an ogre like a war fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will tell you that the villages and towns around the wilderness of the past 20 years have been attacked by the orcs every year. Those beasts are hunting like humans will be alive. The people grabbed and killed and ate. When I led the annihilation of these beasts, I saw the ornaments made by the bones of the people among their tribes. They took the human skin as paper and dressed as clothes. Now those beasts are The big model has established a city to negotiate with us. Don’t be a warrior, even as a person, can you allow this?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general’s voice is no longer Then there is only sadness and a kind of tired anger. But Asa’s heart is not calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will not know what the orcs have eaten. One of the greatest impressions of these sub-humans in the past was the bloody and evil barbarism. Compared with the chic in the main mouth of the city of Cedros, it is really bloody to hear this kind of tragedy from an old population who lost his wife and children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Asa really knows that sending troops to attack is definitely a dead end. And from now on, under the leadership of Cedros, the relationship between the orcs and humans will be completely different. There is no point in this kind of war that is purely for the hatred of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa took a few deep breaths and watched the general whisper: "I'm sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Tall The body trembled a little. Despair and loss of pain twisted into his face and slowly turned into anger. Murder has been revealed in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you kill Asa, it is still possible to command the army to still revenge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking in front of him like a lion-like general with a fangs anger, Asa calmly shook his head and said: "If your wife and children are in the sky Ling will never want you to use these 40,000 lives to avenge them. If they know that you want to sacrifice these living people as sacrifices, do you think they will be happy? You think they want you to die too. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general is still squatting at Asa but slowly his eyes become utterly powerless and dying. He stood like that and finally turned around silently and then ignored Asa alone and walked back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high back of the bloody sunset is no longer awesome and majestic. Looking at this back gradually disappeared in the sunset, Asa only hopes that the Duke of Mulak can hurry up and hurry to retreat to end this. Let him cross the bishop and then travel to forget these nasty things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half moon at night is hanging in the sky. This is a cloudy day that is rare in the highlands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General can't sleep in bed. This is the first time he has been insomnia since his first murder at the age of thirteen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s completely different from the inexplicable fear and excitement of the time. Now he only feels tired and weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not fatigue but the burnout and despair that are really pressing on the heart. Not only does every muscle fail to lift, but even the spirit collapses. It seems that the body is just a body and no longer has any vitality to drive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every new and old wound in the whole body is licking this time. These decades of Hummer career have nothing at all. Both the wife and the son died in the hands of the orcs, but now they can't even avenge them. And he will leave the army under the means of those politicians. From then on, like the useless old dogs, they will eat the leftovers given by the politicians until they die. Even like a warrior, using his broken bones to puncture the enemy's chest and die, it is just a luxury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no longer alive. Even death can’t die. The general’s eyes are closed and the feeling of sadness and despair in powerlessness feels like a beach. The mud slowly melts and deforms and rots away<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father and adults." A deep voice awakened the general. The general saw his son in the blink of an eye. The youngest favorite and most gifted son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still the same powerful and calm face as he was when he was young, as if he had just come from a fierce battle. He held a bare hilt in his hand and stood there straight. The blood from a torn wound on his forehead reddened his entire face but still couldn’t cover his heroic look. The bloody hole left by the horrible weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "you" general did not dare to move, fearing that the image was suddenly disturbed and disappeared. He did not know whether this was the soul of his son or the illusion created by his own thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My father, I followed your teachings until I finally tried my best to fight in the most brilliant battle. My death is the most glorious of a warrior. Home." He stood very powerful and firmly held the scary wound on the chest of his hand as if it were a medal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it? You are doing well, it is my good boy," the general murmured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw countless innocent people who died in the hands of the orcs. They all died very badly. But they are also saying that you are a big hero. Killed a lot of brutal beasts to avenge them. I also saw the soldiers who died in the battle with the orcs. They all encouraged you to continue your battle. You have been fighting for the revenge of those who died. Maybe you are not the greatest general but you are the greatest fighter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" The general nodded a tear and dried up from there. The eyes dripped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general has always been the most hated and most scornful of such things. He thinks this is the weakest symbol of the warrior's most unwanted things, but now he feels that all the vitality of his vitality is coming out with this tear in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also met my mother. She said that she hopes to wait for you in heaven to wait for you to see her in the most glorious way. I also hope to see my father again. The heroic battle is the real you." The voice gradually fades away and the image is slowly blurred. "Goodbye father, I am leaving first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children" General slammed up from the bed and the sky was already bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this just a dream? The general had tears on his face. He wiped his face and sat half-sitting. He looked around and saw a small thing on the ground not far away to meet the morning light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general slowly walked over and picked up the thing with his shaking hand. This is a bare blade of the sword. It seems to have been crushed by the force, leaving only a little broken and staying near the hilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably a long-lasting sun and rain, it looks very old, even if it is thrown on the side of the road, it will not attract attention, but the general recognizes what it is. At the end of the hilt is a recess of the Holy Cross, which is the mark of the Paladin and the other side is the words 'courage' and glory, which the general himself personally engraved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
