			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luyana’s original and simple face suddenly appeared such a complex expression. This strong contrast is enough for anyone who sees to remember for a lifetime. Moreover, it was just yesterday's matter. Asa once thought of the face that was confused and angry and disappointed and distorted, and immediately came to mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You personally open the door to let Gru leave the black elf that is more than a recognition of the relationship between you and the black elf is more important metaphor, you think a sensuality The evil black elves are more important than the friendship and identity of all the Sierra Leonean elves. Elder Luca is disappointing to you, of course, of course, it’s not just her, I am a bit disappointed. Probably Mr. Sedros is also.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You too?" Asa looked at the wrinkled face of the elder elder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then of course. The existence of the black elf will hinder the alliance between Tula Leone and Oufu, especially our alliance can only remain in one kind. Under the circumstances that the secret is very subtle and cannot be officially announced." Elder Lloyd sighed. "The other elves don't think about the relationship between the intuition and the like. They can influence them. A black elf plus the magic you use is enough for them to worry about."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nodded. "No wonder I wondered why Gru would have to kill Jessica."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, Gruda can not talk in front of so many people. I have to die like this." Elder Lloyd frowned and smiled. "It's not better to solve these problems privately with other roundabouts. You have to let so many elves know that you are a leg with the sinister evil black elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Asa thought for a moment and said, "He is deliberate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "He wants me to choose below. Is to choose Jessica's life or choose the identity of the elf. Let me use the room for other ways to turn." Asa smiled and shook his head. "He is such a direct person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But after all, why do you want to shelter the black elf? Do you like her very much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't like it or not." Asa shook her head and revealed a strange bitter smile and helplessness. "She just did her own thing and it didn't make sense to sacrifice her because she had nothing to do with her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is your belief?" Elder Lloyd looked at his pair and was completely different from the other elves. The opaque eyes of a human old man are not embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What beliefs are not so great." Asa smiled and said. "I just think that way..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Elder Lloyd smiled and made people unclear. "Elder Luya and the other four elders will go to Oufu with the leaves of the world tree tomorrow. It will take a long time to use the power of the leaves of the world tree and the ridiculous land of Luya’s natural magical wilderness. It is full of enough food for the beasts to eat and graze."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nodded secretly no matter what went wrong in the process, the final result was finally achieved. The meeting between Sedros and the elders of the elves did not participate, and even after the face of Cedrus was not seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the arrangement at the time, he led the three generations of Druid and Jessica to chase the thieves who walked out of the forest. Under the containment of the four-person room, the thief group that was famous in Elazia was finally wiped out. But it is not easy and fast to track the thieves to go on for dozens of miles and wait for them to get out of the forest and then collect and kill. It was night when they returned to Tula. Both Sedros and Gru have left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Lloyd continues to faintly say: "Mr. Cedrus asked you to bring people who are being stolen by thieves to be sold in Elazia. Come on. After all, they are also in danger because of your plan. You have this responsibility to save them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stunned and nodded. Unexpectedly, Cedros would actually admit to the elder elders that behind the thieves, he was instigating that it really made him feel very surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is right now. In the eyes of Lloyd’s elders, there was a sudden flash of light and asked: “Is it really a ghost for Cedrus and you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately after sighing, I took a big cold heart and immediately mentioned the eyes of the blind. The consequences of this mistake of one's own mistakes have gone through a lot of hardships. Perhaps this is because of the fact that he has lost his own mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have always been weird. If it is the Necromancer who knows how the world tree leaves are here, how can you only send these little thieves? Even the paladin and The cardinal is only hard on our enchantment. If it is not for those who have a good understanding of our magic enchantment, how can we make a reel that can be silently cracked and enchanted, and the cardinal With the kind of human mind and judgment, how can it be untargeted..." The light in the eyes of Elder Lloyd flickered. "It seems that the cardinal and the paladin should not be your deliberately drawn plan. You just want the thieves to take some elves and tell us through their mouths that Deva Valley already knows the world tree. The leaves are here and then you can take it for you. Let us help you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not speak, he was the elf elder and before The elves he knows are completely different. Other seemingly incomparable elves are stubborn and stubborn, like the cypress, and the elders of this old-fashioned mind are more sensitive than the old master politicians. Although this plan is flawed because of its own fault. However, it is indeed amazing to be able to extract the whole plan from these leaked clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the elder elder immediately sighed and nodded helplessly and said: "But I also know that Oufu is the life of Cedros. He is also forced to do so. The key thing is that this step can't be recovered. Now we can't help him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...I know these are also going to help Cedros ?? Asa asked cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I help?" The elder elder smiled. "No help. He gave me a condition that could not be refused. If the Necromancer or the church really came to seize the world tree, he and General Gru would arrive at the first time. Although this situation is much He made it by hand, but we couldn't refuse it. If the news of the world tree leaves really leaked to the Descartes Valley, the means of the Necromancers would not dare to take it alone. Although we rely on this war tree, we have confidence. In the face of any opponent, but those necromancers are too dangerous. The whispering slang is an example of an appointment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry." Asa sighed with a sigh. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Lloyd sighed and said with a smile: "You don't have to feel guilty. In fact, we also have the reason for Oufu. If Oufu is really annihilated by the church, then The object that came down might be Tula Leone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Asa frowned. The time between the Sierra Leone Forest and Celeste is not a few decades. The church seems to have no reason to suddenly start with the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the 20 years after the pope’s ascension, the power of the Church of the Light in the Big 6 is unprecedented. The largest country in the 6th National Congress of the East The empire and the power of the church in many countries of the West 6 have become ingrained. In recent years, the battle against Nigan has progressed smoothly. His Majesty is naturally focused on how to unite the spiritual beliefs of the Big 6. The conquest and conquest have gradually strengthened." Lloyd looked at Asa. "In particular, the news that the cardinal of the Ernest's Cardinal, Ronis, was suddenly assassinated by you, strengthened the determination of Magnus to unite the big 6."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bishop Ronis is nominally a cardinal under the Celest, but his position in the church is respected. Especially in the East 6 side, the people's hopes and influence are not under the pope or even because of the wild heights. Many people in Dongda 6 only know that there is a bishop of Ronis who does not know that there is a pope. Both Ronis and Magnus are quite different from each other. So they invisibly restrained Celeste. Nice also publicly claimed to support the establishment of the European Fu. Now the Ronald Bishop of Death and the School of the Dead also returned to the Pope in the hands of the Pope. Almost all of them are in his grasp." Elder Lloyd sighed and said: "Almost already Actually not. The gap during this period is the most attractive driving force."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The establishment of Oufu is actually beneficial to all countries. Los's plan is also impeccable. It is a situation that is surrounded by all sides. Although those who have the guilds of the Necromancer are secretly guilty of ghosts, they actually only catalyze this effect. The intention of Pope Magnus is the real reason. If he is allowed to take Oufu easily The downfall must be the place where the sacred glory of the Glorious Castle is not accepted. The Tulalian Forest is the largest and most obvious place. So we must help Oufu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I said it. I helped Oufu to be our shield instead of us as a shield for Oufu." The elder elder smiled very embarrassedly. "We can help Oufu to help at least on the surface. We must keep our attitude against Celest. We are using us if we can't use him. He should be too bright." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you really an elf?" Asa looked at the old man who looked like a fox in front of him and doubted it was a human with a fake ear. It is still the kind of old tycoon on the counter and in the exchange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think the elves are stupid?" Elf elders squinted at Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least most of them are." Asa nodded and added a sentence immediately. "I think that's all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the elves are all of you, then Tula Leone does not need to find Oufu as a shield." Asa sighed. It feels a pity. With the lifespan of the elves who are much longer than humans, even if only one in ten people have such a mind as the old elf for the purpose of exhibition and research and practice magic, maybe this big 6 will not turn to the whistle valley. And the church is rampant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Lloyd smiled and pointed at himself asking Asa a strange question: "How old are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa frowns carefully and looks at the wrinkles of this elf that is not as big as the elf. Slightly turbid eyeballs. The lives of the elves are mostly over the age of hundreds and almost always maintain the appearance of the handsome and beautiful. Elder Lloyd was able to live to reveal such an old color and to rely on the savvy mind and the ordinary elves to think that the thoughts should belong to the monster-level old man anyway. Asa estimated and said, "Probably... more than a thousand and two thousand years old."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha..." Lloyd laughed first and then laughed and then smiled. Watching Asa shake his head and say. "I am only 125 years old this year. I use the standards of our elves to measure that I am actually just a young person. Or a teenager."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people? Juvenile?” Asa could hardly associate this energetic word with the old-fashioned old man who had no wrinkles in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must be very surprised why I am different from other elf compatriots at this age. I tell you. This is because I think too Considering too many reasons. Whether it is weighing the pros and cons or thinking about it, this is contrary to the teachings of the great Marfa. My heart has lost contact with nature and vitality has already begun to dry up."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa frowned without speaking, he did not believe it. In fact, no matter who is it, it is hard to believe this kind of thing that sounds inexplicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You come over and let me see something." Elder Lloyd went to the side of the tree house and recited a spell and gently stroked the wall. This wooden wall, which was originally the torso of the ancient tree, actually appeared as a passage along the curse as if it had life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the passage, walking down the end of the passage is a secret room Asa estimated. Here is probably the middle of a huge ancient tree. Surrounded by strong natural magic, this breath is not as tense as other magical fluctuations. It is just like a spring breeze that feels warm and safe as if it is soaked in a vibrant amniotic fluid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chamber of Secrets is not too big and there is not much room for the softness of the top of the Chamber. Asa stared at it and saw that it was a small piece of wood that was integrated into the roof. However, he was not attracted too much attention by this piece of wood that could actually be light. Instead, I was concentrating on a map on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is undoubtedly a huge magic map, but Asa is really hard to imagine what kind of talent can make such a vivid map. The illusion of magic constitutes as fine as the real thing, and it seems that the waves of the river can be seen. He couldn't help but lean over and put his eyes in front of the map. But no matter how he looks, he can't see the traces of the model. It's like the feeling of overlooking the earth under the height of 10,000 meters. Even if you can't see the fiber, it's quite clear but you can feel the hidden inside. The endless truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Lloyd nodded with his fingers in the place where Asa watched carefully, and then the entire magic map immediately fluctuated and changed to make a look at Asa’s magnified map. Sa can even see some dust-sized animals moving slowly on the map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a magic map left over from the ancient elf empire. You can clearly see how many trees are on a mountain by looking at the whole big 6." Elder Lloyd sighed. "Unfortunately this is probably the last thing left on the Big 6."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Elf Empire?" Asa felt as if he had a vague impression of the term. But this impression is extremely vague and seems to have been inadvertently touched only somewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There should be no records in humans only for thousands of years. According to the legends of our elves, our ancestors have created miracles tens of thousands of years ago. The civilized construction of huge floating cities and dragons and giants fight. But the excessive use of wisdom and power ultimately results in the loss of balance in the world. The power of powerful wisdom produces too strong power. The limit controlled by the soul is that when the power is out of control, the endless darkness engulfs the entire 6th civilization. Finally, only a small group of elves under the protection of Marfa survived. The place is the whispering of the forest now the whole big 6 The source of all the elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After that, Marfa teaches the remnants of the elves that can no longer be obsessed with wisdom and strength. Only natural peace and true survival. This is also the vitality of all the elves. I have lost the sanctuary of Marfa in violation of this principle." Elder Lloyd sighed this old elf boy with a pair of turbid eyes One kind of decided sad. "But I have to do this. I am a must in this chaotic environment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Lloyd looked at Asa. Suddenly the topic turned: "It is necessary for people like you in such an environment. I am very happy that people who are the leaves of the world tree are people like you. This is why I brought you here to tell you these things. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa. For the elves, the fact that they swallow their holy objects seems to be ‘happy’ in any case. Even more strange is that he does not believe that Cedros will tell the elves about this. This time, he dared not to be as rash as he used to be, but he was only confused and frowning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what I asked the elders of Luya to experiment. Don't worry that we are not at least my understanding of the magic of Mafa and whispering. Sen's compatriots are not the same." But Elder Lloyd is just right in the point of Asa's doubts and his next words make Asa fall into the fog. "You are the person who is qualified to use the holy things of Marfa for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time in the distant Deya Valley. The meditation room in the deep mountain belly does not appear to be the slightest darkness. On the contrary, the brilliance of the white magic of the five magic jade illuminates the entire meditation room as if it were exposed to the sun. Every gap and crack on the stone wall can be seen clearly. Clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five magic jade are arranged in the position of the five-pointed star. The ground is also covered with complex magic symbols that resonate under the magical power of five magic jade. . Formed a strange magical array. The center of the magic array is a figure. Although it is not able to see the specific appearance of this figure under the dazzling brilliance of white magic, this figure does not look like a stone statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but as long as someone who knows some magical common sense can see this scene, it can be concluded that this figure is definitely not a stone statue because there is no stone statue worthy of five worth of price. The magic jade lays out the magical array of white magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this figure has always kept the stone-like substance, even the fluctuations and sounds of breathing are not just standing silently in white light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sounds are not ringing. No change in this room is like a still time. Whether it is a day or a month, it is only one second. It’s the same here. Everything here is as static as a portrait depicting a two-dimensional plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly a voice broke the absolute stillness of this picture. Distant and subtle footsteps came from the long passage. But the figure in the white light is still not moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The channel is very long, but the footsteps are exactly as boring as the mechanical size. In the still still picture, this monotonous footstep sounded for a century before it came to the chamber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of this boring footsteps makes this monotonous picture alive. This is a handsome heroic energy and energy on the face and body. Every place can show a glorious young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
