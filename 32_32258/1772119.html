			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The edge of a mountain at the edge of the whirlwind valley has a small passage leading directly to the mountain. There is a small room in the rock formation hundreds of meters thick in the mountain. It is a meditation room dedicated to the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vide Nina walked out of the passage and looked up and left for a long time. The sun was deeply breathed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the most favorite actions she did when she was a human being a long time ago. I feel that the sun is slowly turning on the delicate skin of my own body. Every bath in the warmth of the light touches the vitality between myself and the world. And whenever she does this action, her face that is not inferior to the sun and the expression above will definitely make the onlookers dazzle. But now she only feels that the dried dead meat attached to her skull is slowly deformed in the long-lost sunshine because of the temperature difference from the bottom of the earth. A zombie with cockroaches and locusts revived on their faces...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was surrounded by a circle of black fog, dark magical power has been in real form Start to fluctuate around the body. Just awakened from a month-long meditation, her magical power has entered an unprecedented realm. The body of the Lich's immortal body does not need to rest or eat and sleep. This body is simply for the power of magic and wisdom. She can even feel that her feelings and the instinct she used to be as a creature are constantly weakening and disappearing with the increase of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes she would think if these things disappear completely? Without the basic ** and feelings, there is no conscious goal. I don’t think about it. Maybe I don’t even think about self-existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But fortunately, the emotional imprints imprinted on the deepest part of the soul have not disappeared. She knows what she is going to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three figures standing in the exit and they seem to have been waiting here. When Ved Nina walked over, the three men also came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the old man, the top and bottom of the old man looked at Vide Nina nodded with his desolation voice: "Dear Ved Nina can not think of your magic power I have reached such a realm, and then I will be able to get close to the height of the great Agibabad in time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich swept three people and faintly answered: "You have a reputation Master Aiden. But I think the three of you looking for me will not just praise me. I am very busy and have important things to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The three of us today want to ask you some questions." A middle-aged man next to his face said in a very gentle tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The three drivers of labor must be a very important issue." Ved Nina stepped back and she felt that the three companions had Very strange magical fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This question must be easy to answer for you with such power and wisdom." Master Aiden said faintly: "We remember your last bet. The winner of the appointment is that we agree to a new member. Now we would like to ask you what kind of person is the person who joins our guild? Is there enough qualification to join our noble organization?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Absolutely qualified." Ved Nina went back one step further and said that the hoarse voice was peaceful. "He should be the person who is most qualified to join the Necromancer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" The voice of Aiden’s old man is still very indifferent as if it were just A casual question can ask questions that you can't ask. But he and his two peers followed and stepped into a triangle to trap Ved Nina in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have my own reason." Ved Nina did not retreat from the black fog and began to thicken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha..." Aiden’s master made a misty, low-key laugh. But the atmosphere did not ease down because of this laugh. "Respectable Ms. Vidnina. We don't doubt your incomparable wisdom and judgment. But for this matter, I think everyone is still discussing it slowly... The newcomer you introduced has just been destroyed in the whispering forest. A huge action planned by all of our members. I feel that this newcomer still needs to think about it. Out of respect for you, we intend to invite you to take a break in one place..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since the great Archibald founded the Necromancer Society, there has never been a situation in which the Necromancer has been in chaos. Those who can join this noble organization have the same wisdom and cultivation even without the same goals and ideas. Fighting disputes with violence like those who are stupid and stupid." Master Aiden took out a white jade from his arms. "I said we just asked you to take a break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two necromancers also took out the same jade. The soft, pure white light of the three jade stones is pure white magic. The three jade stones surrounded by the three Necromancers, and the milky white magical fluctuations surrounded Vid Nina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are really willing. Use three magic jade to seal the white magic." The black fog on Widenna is already strong. Like a snake, the ink rolls around her body and madly swallows the white light around it. Her voice sounded like a curse directly from the paragraph. "But do you think that you can do it with three of you? Don't forget that you are not proficient in white magic. I may not be the opponent of the three of you but it is not so easy to imprison me." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sigh sighed behind her and another white magic and the three blends produced a subtle resonance. The black ripples on her body are like the flame moments under the tide. It was suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turned out to be you." Ved Nina turned and saw the voice behind her, and she was completely dumb. "I don't think it's you. Are you the same as they think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no white magic in the hands of the man who is holding the magic jade, but it is the most powerful. The most honest because it was learned under the guidance of the most formal Master of Magic at the School of Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His very handsome and very graceful face is now a strange expression. He shook his head and looked at the lich's face between the zombie and the sly face. It was all gentle and said with a very painful voice: "You are too clever and too impulsive to be too naive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the meeting of Deya Valley was held. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conference room is not so great that there are no traces of luxury and decoration that just look like an ordinary hall. The furnishings are simple and simple. Everything has substantial use. Deliberate decoration and luxury are meaningless here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already late at night, but the conference room is still lit like a large piece of magic crystal inlaid in the top of the room, spreading the soft and bright brilliance evenly to every corner. Light that is exactly like daylight is not glaring. A small piece of this kind of thing is usually enough for many magicians to try their best to make a very high-end wand at a cost, but here it is purely used for lighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the hall is a large, very delicate round table. Each line above the very elegant shape is exquisite and harmonious to the point of art. It was a long time ago that a member spent three years carving a large 6-year-old Wannian sandalwood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are thirteen chairs around the round table. Now nine chairs have been seated. This is the biggest meeting of the Necromancer Association in the past decade. People who come can come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other places, they have the power of the rich and the enemy. Some of the sages who are admired by the people are the impoverished hermits. But all the fame and wealth in the world here are not worth mentioning. They are all members of the greatest and most noble Society of the Dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge crystal ball in the center of the round table. The illusion of the image in the ball is the whisper of the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gargoyle in the sky is guiding the sun with the blood fog magic array to pour the focus of death to the sun well. Suddenly a huge flame ball rises from the ground and almost half the diameter of the blood fog magic array. It seems that the slow fireball and the magical array are in contact, and then the image in the crystal ball is left with a violent fire. Although there is no sound, everyone sitting in it seems to feel a faint shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A necromancer laughed but only a cough like a cough pointed at the crystal ball that went down and said: "A fireball actually has and cursed Similar destructive power I think we should all start to re-learn the basic theory of magic from apprentices."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is our elaborate gargoyle..." The well-maintained middle-aged man held his eyes closed and sighed. "Those who spend the magic material, if you convert it into gold coins, you can buy a big country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person who can resonate with the power of the Sunwell should be the one who accepted the baptism of the Sun in the Elves." A Necromancer made a conclusion. Others nodded. "But what you said is just a human being, but how human beings can be baptized by the ruthless elves can be a little incredible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Master Aiden continued: "I will tell you some other news. After I was born, I immediately investigated the fact that the person who was wanted by the elves was a priest under the head of Ronis. And some of our respects some time ago. In this great drama designed by Hamm, which was supposed to make the entire Dongda 6 shocked, this kid and another woman who spoiled the leaves of a world tree squirted a vampire with his own blood. The body also has the vitality of the leaves of the world tree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did this important thing not be heard by Hamm?" To the Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis smiled a bit and replied: "Ronnis didn't know the foreign language afterwards. What is the effect of blessing? I was busy with other things at the time, so I didn't care at all." I thought that only the woman’s blood was working.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the necromancer said: “This is no matter what. According to Hamm, this kid At the School of Magic, I lived with our respected former Acting President, Mr. Sandru. From the point of view that he was able to absorb the sun baptism, we have reason to believe that he had studied the real meditation of Sandru. From the character of a respected and noble acting president, this is indeed very likely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall is silent. Necromancers no longer talk and sigh. Everything about this person makes them feel amazed but if you put them together, it is far from being shocked but shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Lord Akibad said that one day the people who gathered together would pull up the dark star to revolutionize the world from the central place. Those who have been practicing true meditation have been rituals of the elves. It is also a generation after generation. The leaves of the world tree have also shown strength in the human world.... These are not surprising." He has been very dull and desolated. It’s up. "But now it's important that the three things of the real world of the Sunwell Tree are all in one person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still no silence in the hall. The Necromancers communicated with strange eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Aiden’s master is eccentric and it seems to be a bitter laughter. "In theory, this person can really open the Star of Darkness. And if he really opened the rules that were given to us by Lord Aquibad, we should surrender to follow him under the King of the Necromancer. To conquer the world." The cold and sly eyes of Master Aiden have been swinging around the expressions of various members. "I don't know how everyone sees this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence still occupies the hall. For a long time, a cough of a Necromancer broke the silence. He coughed and said slowly: "Conquer the world? I think this boring and vulgar fact is not suitable for our noble and elegant people."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The well-maintained Necromancer lowered his head and whispered with a ring that was more delicate and delicate than a girl’s finger, and said: "And I I feel that the world is very good now and there is no need to change anything. The key is..." He showed a kind and kind and confident smile to his colleagues. "The world doesn't need us to conquer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The necromancer of the face nodded and agreed. “There is no need to let people touch the Dark Star. Even if it can be pulled out, it may be just a monster that only knows destruction and destruction. There is no benefit to us.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also think so..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Necromancers slowly and steadily expressed their unanimous views. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the last member expressed his attitude, Master Eden finally showed a smile. He knew that the rules of a name and death were now completely and completely broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For every magician, the magician named Akibad, who is closest to God, is even more weighty than God. After all, it was a living existence. Especially for the Necromancer who learns many of the Necromancer spells he created, he is more able to feel the greatness of this magician from that profound magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
