			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not really go down in the incomparable majesty and spirit of the angel. He just stunned and immediately turned and ran again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person is running but the thought is not just a pure escape. The phoenix above the phoenix is ​​even the ancient god bird but his summoned beast. Under his thoughts, the phoenix screams at the archangel, the one who turned to stop him from the sky and slammed into the angel's body with a sky full of fire. The claws have fallen deeply into the shoulders of the angels. The huge body of the angel smashed into the ground with a spoiled <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great sword flew out together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the battle of the sky, the angels and the phoenix were all evenly matched, but this turn made the Phoenix fully advantageous. Two huge bodies squatted on the ground. The entire Celeste was shaking the bodies of these two behemoths and crushing several buildings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phoenix did not stop there. The sea of ​​fire surrounded by the body has completely embraced the upper body of the archangel. This is purely rich. The self-derived purgatory of the fire elf can be derived by itself, and the mouth of the phoenix is ​​more hot than this, and the spit is spit on the head of the archangel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame spreads from the body of the archangel. Everything burns in this flame, and even the masonry of the building smashes and smashes in this flame. The concept of full-bodied fire has already emerged from the flame. The concept of the dragon's scales and resistance is incapable of high temperature breath. The ground has also become a boiling magma lake phoenix and the range of 100 meters around the angels seems to suddenly become the legendary fire element. Even the archangels make it a golden mist like water vapor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hymns have just turned to the original scream. All the priests on the ground were standing up. But their exclamations have not come yet. All turned to cheers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky of white light rain did not weaken. I don’t know where the hymns came from still in everyone’s ears. The shield in the hands of the archangels slammed the sword and screamed at the phoenix, screaming again and again, the red fire plumes were scattered all over the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The archangel is still standing in a golden gold cellar. The white wings behind the face with no expression of majesty are still so white and flawless. The flames that melted everything did not leave even a trace of traces on him. A huge double wing show. The angel flew again toward the phoenix in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All pastors are cheering that only the high-ranking Pope is standing on the bright hall, still no expression, no movement, but no one can see the corners of the nose and nose. There is blood seeping from the body of this old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot still didn’t see it, but he seemed to feel something. He turned his head and looked at the bright hall. The pope suddenly turned and didn’t even care about Asa. Instead, he screamed at the Knights of the Temple of Mercedes: "Get out of the way." Then he grabbed a slate on the ground and threw it into the air. Then they jumped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-sky Lancelot stepped on the slate slab that he threw and smashed into a myriad of small pieces and he himself continued to shoot upwards. And go. The temperament of the temperament smashed into a vindictive cross sword with a fierce wind blowing to the phoenix. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sword is rushed to the extreme, though rushed. Although the giant sword that is condensed with the paladin as the core is not eye-catching in the huge body of the phoenix, the flame that has not yet reached the phoenix body has been forced to retreat and disperse a few flaming elves in the sword. Immediately smash under the gas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the whole sword of Lancelot and the sword that almost killed Morrier in the underground of Nigan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Moriel was not able to move at the end of the time but the phoenix was not. Phoenix seems to have also felt the sharp volley of this sword turned and rolled. However, the Holy Light Cross Sword actually slanted and followed the shape of the Phoenix and smashed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slamming of the Holy Light Cross Sword slanted into the body of the phoenix. For the Phoenix, this sword is not too heavy in terms of its vitality and resilience. It can even be self-healing after a long time. However, Lancelot’s sword originally did not think that it could kill this ancient beast. He is Make opportunities for others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
