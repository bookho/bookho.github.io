			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, if the magic scroll is a thing like a printed book, it would be better to use a mechanical one to suppress it. One pressure is a one-press... ... Yes, the more intelligent guy has research on the machine, and should go back to the horse to marry him to find him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You like magic very much "Reel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Bolugan was somewhat surprised. It is not an accidental problem, but some surprises that Gru will ask this question a bit strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you like magic scrolls?" Gru repeats, the same voice has the same tone and the same tone, even the expression has no change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brugan’s honest answer: “I don’t like it from the scroll itself. In fact, I have always been somewhat annoying about magicians. Something...but these things are good things for Oufu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru said unforcibly: "I know from work, you Like Sedros, the whole Oufu is the most important and most effective person, but Oufu has nothing to do with you. Do you think it is interesting to build Oufu?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Funny, it's fun." Bolugan nodded. This is also the truth, but his mind is more and more doubtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows Gru's time is not long, and it must not be too short. But he never met Gru to ask such a question that seems to be more 'private'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least as far as he saw and heard, General Gru’s words are not many, they are simple and clear, and they are all related to Oufu, and there is no obvious The signs of private nature are revealed in his words and deeds. Sometimes he really doubts whether this man will be a magical couple, a magical puppet for the sake of Oufu and fighting. In addition to the obvious and dazzling features of 'strong', he seems to have no hobbies, no friends to communicate, no vacant personality, and even a person who should have a normal person's humanity is not able to get away from it. feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Gru nodded slightly. "I also find it interesting. Sedros didn't lie to me, it was really interesting, than in Nigan." It’s a lot more interesting.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sit down and talk slowly, General Gru.” He was very curious when he stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I like to stand. Just talk to you casually." General Gru did not move, still standing straight. He seems to never sit down when he can stand. Rest, rest, relaxation, these concepts are completely out of place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hate the scrolls too." Gru frowned, and there was some disgusting disgust on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whoever can use, anyone can kill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, good to be sure Yes.” Bolugan nodded, but this day is also the value of the scroll. Even the most powerful paladin, Lancelot, is said to be impossible to use the top scroll with ten magic apprentices. Warriors like Lancelot have only appeared one in the continent for decades. And a group of 10 senior scrolls of magicians only took a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really boring, it’s boring. It’s boring to have fun and even the original things that are interesting.” Gru faintly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe." Bolugan squinted his head. He doesn't quite understand the meaning of Gru's words. Perhaps he is recalling the three Knights of the Knights of the Judah who were killed by the curse. Bolugan remembered that after the return of Gru, he said a short sentence, "regret, boring." Perhaps he is saying that it is boring to open a mine in the Sandefes Mountain Range for the sake of Oufu, but to make a lot of scrolls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this rare sensation has already been completed, and Gru turned and walked toward the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General Gru, do you know what?" said Bolugan suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know." Gru stood and turned to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru looked at the Bolugan adults for a moment and nodded. "You mean that the scroll is inevitable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Technology and props This kind of thing was originally developed in a direction that is getting stronger and more useful. The guys I want to invent, the first officer to equip the troops, must be the same as when I talked about the scrolls. It’s very interesting.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Maybe it.” Gru nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before it was 弩, now it’s a scroll, it’s definitely something more powerful in the future. I’ve told a brother who studied alchemy and mechanics, maybe After the development, even the shackles don't have to rely on the warriors, relying on the props. One finger goes down, dozens, hundreds, even thousands of elite warriors are instantly dying under the props. More than war, maybe other places rely on Props..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world of boring." Gru cold and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the pursuit of these people is definitely for fun. Just like you and me, I am making a lot of magic scrolls for the fun of the development of Oufu. This kind of boring thing. Hey... What is this logic..." Bolugan thought about it with his chin. “In the process of pursuing fun, the result is to make the world more and more boring?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“boring.” Gru thought for a moment, faint Leave this sentence and turn around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it was such a truth..." Bolugan also pinched his wide chin and tried to figure out the result of his own reasoning. . After thinking about it for a long time, I didn't seem to think very well. I still picked up the file next to it and looked at it. I still muttered it in my mouth. "By...I want to do so much things I don't want to do... What to do or what to do..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cabin, Aier’s mother is sitting at the table and concentrates Listening to Asa to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are quite a few people sitting in front of each other talking, just in the 20th time, Asa carefully listened to the story of Ai’s mother-in-law and Instigated, but now it is completely reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversation lasted for a long time, and Asa’s words were too much. Starting from the underground tunnel, the encounter with Lancelot, the hilt of the Dark Star was taken away, then the sudden shot of Moriel, and finally the story and truth of Moriel. These are all things that are unexpected and unimaginable. However, the color of surprise on Ai's mother's face was not too heavy, just surprised, but Deng did not lose color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lancelot's son actually went to play Morrill's idea, and he was too big... No, it should be said that Magnus The courage of the letter is too big. I remember that the guy didn't seem to be this character... accident." Ai's mother smiled and shook her head. "But the most unexpected, the truth of the Dark Star is actually this, the great Lord Akibad, I really admire you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Ai's mother-in-law suddenly asked: "You haven't told this to Sand, you guess what kind of reaction he will hear after hearing it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What reaction?" Asa thought for a moment, violently thundering? Breaking the mouth? Going to Nigan to find Morial or returning to the whistle valley? He shook his head. "I don't know, I can't guess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai's mother sighed with a smile. "I don't think that I knew that what happened to me for the rest of my life was actually like this. What kind of mood would it be. We used to be self-righteous, obsessed, obsessed, confused, confused, so I took it. The last words of Maubard’s adults are like that. I also sneered at Vadrina’s little girl and said that she is crazy. In fact, who of us is not using our own heart to forcefully explain the words of Akibad? I have been trapped by my own grief for half a lifetime... This is probably because we are far from the punishment of the clear and high heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say, what are you going to do?" "Ai's mother looked at Asa and asked." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa answered. "I still go to Celeste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai's mother shook her head and said, "If you want to get back the hilt, I will advise Don't go any more. Since there are no great unchangeable prophecies, then don't go into the relationship with this thing. For this thing, you have suffered a lot, I don't want you to take risks again. Lancelot Since you are going, you are naturally prepared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
