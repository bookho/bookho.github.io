			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very common hotel in Bracada. The brothel mixed-use building is full of mercenary merchants and prostitutes. The semi-drunk prostitute's spoiled chat bargains are seamlessly integrated into each other to form a unique atmosphere in this town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the pub was kicked open. A young man walked in a dirty robes and put his face in half. The lower half of the face was also full of traces of dust. It’s a very common dress in the city, but it’s attracting the attention of the whole pub. Especially the eyes of the mercenaries, with a lot of hostile blood alcohol catalyzed the temperament of the lifestyle to make them arrogant. The gesture is very sensitive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘叮’ is not a very loud voice that calms the atmosphere and sway of the whole pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of this thing is a round thing with a yellow radiance shining in the sky is rolling from the air into the palm of the intruder. All the people can tell at a glance that the above light is not the red and yellow of copper. There is no other metal that can have such a charming color. Almost all people often see this color in their sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to hire someone." The intruder sat on a table with a bit of impatience. The tone was even more arrogant but no one thought he was crazy. . The thing between the fingers is basically a pass for any behavior in any place. "You choose the one who is the best between you. If he can pass my hand, I will hire him. One gold coin a day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just one day and It is one hundred times the average monthly salary. A small group of people in the pub stood up in the same place and all the guys who were holding their own meals were murderously examining the competitors. After evaluating each other, some people slowly sat down with their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The weapons are all put down. I don't want to give the local officials an empty hand." The intruder asked for a glass of wine and started to drink. Look at this group of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businessmen and prostitutes all who are still sitting hurriedly fled upstairs to the bartender and the boss watched as they tried to stop and didn’t have the guts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the job seekers began to kick the table stools one by one to make a vacant lot. I don't know which first mover's hand immediately started a chaotic limb fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** and ** The muffled sound of the impact occasionally has bone rupture and screams interspersed with occasional screams and cheers. Dozens of fists, fingers, elbows, knees, heads, teeth, all over the place, all the organs that can be used for attack are fully swayed to fight for the imprint of each other's **. This is definitely a rare and spectacular scene. But the initiator of this scene seems to have no interest in sitting on the table by the door, holding a cup, a small mouth, a small mouth, drinking, and occasionally looking up and immediately frowning, it seems very dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is already the thirteenth place for each family to repeat the same words. From the fourth home he had a beer and now he has a little more to drink. He began to wonder if he would do this to make the mercenary industry in Bracada collapse. I am worried that he suddenly has a very interesting thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**The crashing sound gradually reduced and finally stood the same as the previous twelve times, and finally stood in a slanting position between the peers lying down. champion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the strongest!" The champion smacked his own nose and blood and screamed with a sense of accomplishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you strongest?" The gold coin still flicked between the fingers and seemed to be a little drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because only I am the last person standing, all the opponents have fallen down, so of course I am the strongest." The champion is very proud and still keeps flowing. The <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood blood is his glorious testimony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" The tone of this question dragged on for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" The last word of the champion is sure that he has not spit completely and immediately heard the squatting of his jaw. The sound then has five teeth coming out of the mouth and three in the belly. Finally, the pain hits him and stuns him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was my strongest. If it wasn't, I was too hungry, my body was too weak. I couldn't use this despicable means." The final winner's voice is weak, and the body seems to be somewhat unstable. This blow has almost all his physical strength. Both are used. This is a very thin and embarrassed person who has a messy face and half of his face wearing tattered clothes to reveal his thin but still good body lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now can I get the job if I knock you down again?" The final winner must sprint towards the goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you use this method? At least the result seems to be your strongest." The drunken man smiled at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winner did not speak step by step toward him. Every time he walks, he is accumulating his own strength and fighting spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get closer. The victor knows that if he wants to be the real winner, all the hopes are that he has no residual strength and opportunity. The drunk man in front of him was still so drunk and smiling at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left shoulder swayed forward and the left foot stepped forward and the right hand condensed for a long time and swung out. Kara’s good wine table was smashed by the punches and the wood chips flew around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the only powerful fist was caught when he just broke the table and used up. This is a good time to take advantage of it. As long as you move forward, you will not want to make such a powerful blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows he lost. Even when you are physically fit, you probably won't be an opponent. He has been swaying in this strange city for a few days and he has been hungry for a few days. He used all the remaining hopes and opportunities for this opportunity. The last vain sorrow in a desperate situation has come up to make his hands and feet soft and almost fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he immediately felt that the little thing of Huang Chengcheng was stuffed into his fist. "You passed. Now I want you to have something to eat and then take a bath and then rest comfortably for one night to replenish your strength." It seems that the words of the sky make him a pleasant surprise. He turned his head to look at the person who spoke to this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people looked at each other's appearance at such a close distance and were surprised: "Is it you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening in the room of one of the best hotels in Bracada, Asa lay in bed and carefully recalled everything she saw in the big eared lair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of big-eared monsters is his guarding and attitude towards the cave where Klis is being held. It is true that as Polupan said, they seem to be only the first time to do this kind of experience and wariness. It should be a great opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was still in those troubles, he was suddenly reminded by the "Own Method" of the Bolugan adults. It is true that it was such a long time that Asa immediately planned to use the method that he was very accustomed to and very good at using this thing that made him a headache, and it was very straightforward to solve the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course this is not an easy task. It is a must, but not too much. So he started to go to the pub in the city to find the right person. He didn't expect to find an old acquaintance who had found all the pubs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt walked in. Although he looked much thinner than a month ago, the perfect line of muscles and bones that stood out in the upper body still showed him. Good physique. He had just eaten the best meal he could have in Bracada and then took a shower in the special large bathhouse of the hotel, which made him feel a lot more spiritual. The head and face were cleaned and he looked as handsome and straight as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get a good night, I will call you when I will go tomorrow." Asa bounced from the bed and pointed to the person who just bought it. Clothes and a sword. "That's for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt was still silent. He had never spoken before the two had recognized each other. But his eyes have been jumping and it seems that he doesn't know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Rodhart suddenly bowed to Asa. "No matter what it is today or before. I really appreciate you very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly saw him come this way, Asa was busy waving his hand and said: " Don't you have the villagers still okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
