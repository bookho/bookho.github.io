			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I told him not to go." After listening to Ayi Mei’s story, Ai’s mother-in-law frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My mother-in-law, I know that you must not be an ordinary person. You must also be worried about your big brother, Asa... You can tell me what else can I do now? Save the big brother of Asa?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what else to do... I am just a retired old woman...but..." Ai's mother-in-law looked at Ai Mei and shook her head gently. Her eyes were clear and clear, but she couldn't see anything at all, but she could reflect everything in the bottom but nothing touched her bottom. "From your look and tone, although you are sad but you don't seem to have a real way to panic, what do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I do have a way but I don't know if this is a good idea, but now I can only do this... I... I... I reached an agreement with two very bad guys. I will help them get something. They help me save. Sadago... I also know that these two people are too dangerous. They are not good people. Maybe I am trying to hide with the tiger... but I can’t wait for Asa to be killed by them...”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai Yimei does not know what kind of person Aier and Talis have said to her. The true identity of this old woman is only vaguely aware of this. An old woman is not simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s not a simple person. After all, this is an old man who has been seclusion. It’s really impossible for even two Cardinal and Necromancers to do it. She can do it. Therefore, Ai Meimei just came here to tell her that Asa was arrested with a mentality of trying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mother-in-law, you also know what friends of Asa’s brother are also asking you to let them know... although this is difficult, but there is one more person. There is also a little more hope..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai's mother shook her head and said coldly! "I don't know him any friends. And even if I know, I won't tell them. Who can sneak in the glorious castle to save the strict guards? Even if you go, it will only be sent in vain."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most important thing is that I have already told him not to go here. This is what he asked for. Everyone should pay for his own actions." Looking at Ai Mei. "And I advise you not to go. You have to know that you are the enemy of the entire Glorious Castle. Can you be the opponent of Magnus and Lancelot? And your allies cannot be called allies at all. You know Too many of them will never let you go. Only one percent of the possibilities are that they are willing to help you, and even if they want them, they have only one percent chance to save the kid."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if there is only one in ten thousand chances, I have to use 10,000 points to do it." Ai Mei's voice is light but firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The kid will never agree if you know that you are doing such a stupid thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ayimei did not speak but her eyes and expression did not shake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have already said this. You have to do it and do it for you." Aier’s mother turned and stopped looking at Ai. Yimei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry to disturb my mother-in-law." Ai Mei bent over the back of Ai's mother-in-law and walked out of the hut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the footsteps of Ai Meimei, Ai’s mother-in-law sighed long in the room alone. She sat at the table. I started to squat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took her to stand up and dragged a box out of the bed and opened it with a black suit and a strange shape and a The golden skull mask has some strange props. She looked at the faces of these things with a bitter smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as she just reached out to the things in the box, all the expressions on her face suddenly disappeared. The eyes that originally seemed to be bright and deep turned into two needles. She said coldly: "If you don't want to die, don't mess around. There are more than ten magic traps around me. I can kill you at least 20 times with just a little finger."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please rest assured that I am not a malicious person, I am not malicious. I am here to find you." A nice male voice came out of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
