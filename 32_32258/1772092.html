			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the Wyvern of the Wyvern is ringing in the sky and Asa looks up and looks at the two shadows that seem to be just the size of a bat slowly hovering around him at high altitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is not good. A ride away from the army’s unaccompanied is undoubtedly the best target. When he left the general's army, he carefully tried to walk the woods to hide the trail. However, he did not see the shadow of the Wyvern in the past few days. He knew that he was met and still two when he was about to go to Bracada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the screaming dragons began to swoop down toward him. In the twinkling of an eye, the figure of the dragon is getting bigger and bigger under the sunlight. Even if there is still a distance of several tens of meters, you can feel the hurricane. Asa slammed the horse and stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I am not actually a scout of the Emperor’s team, it seems that there is no explanation for the situation. Asa carefully watched the trajectory of the dragon's dive and grasped the opportunity to reach out and fire a ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His timing is very good. The frequency of the flying dragon's wings and the momentum of the dive. This timing is the only thing that any magician can't match. There is such a feeling of being cultivated in close combat. And only the lowest level spells like fireballs can condense in an instant. This is why Asa has always liked to use this basic spell. It is easy to grasp the opportunity attack without any need for spells and condensed magic. And the power of his fireball is by no means comparable to any low-level magician. It can be a high-level attacking magic. Even this huge monster can't afford a blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that the fireball is about to hit the dragon's chest. Suddenly the fireball seemed to be swayed by an invisible hand, and the fireball was swept away from the side of the Wyvern. The Wyvern of the Wyvern was probably stunned and flew back to the sky with a scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa had not had time to be surprised and immediately saw another scene that surprised him. A small black spot suddenly separated from another bat-like shadow on the sky and began to fall. Of course, it is not a real bat but a huge bipedal image at high altitude and this separated black spot seems to be a person. The man actually jumped from the height of the kilometer with his own initiative and grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person obviously does not use the landing of the volley to reduce the magic as the drop gets faster and closer to the ground and falls under the fly It has become a vague black shadow and can't see who it is. Asa looked a little bit so high that even if this person was cast in steel, it only fell into a pile of shards on the rocks of the highlands. If it is flesh and blood, the result is similar to watermelon and tomatoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa has not been surprised that the shadow has fallen to the ground not far from the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loud, earth-shattering sound. It seems that the whole wild land has shaken in this impact. The gravel smashes into the rock and collapses like a crispy bread. Asa stunned as he looked at the dust in front of him and took a few steps to stand still. It seems to be a thunder that hangs over nine days and carries the power of the wrath of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't want to die, stand there and don't act rashly." The voice is not big but cold and majestic as convincing as this huge power. The figure of a person in the center of the smog filled with smoke is slowly standing up from a half-squatting position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it you?" The smoke spread out the man who descended from the sky and walked up to the ground to recognize Asa. His tall, slightly thin body is like a sculpture-like perfect elegance with a well-defined and resolute face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa slowly nodded: "I should also think that it can only be you who can do this." Even if he can't remember this look, he will never forget. This is almost invincible power and tolerance. That is the general Gru who commanded all the orc troops of Oufu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two-legged flying dragon on Asa listened to the wind and screamed at the tree below the tree. The horse that had been riding like a grass had become like a bug. It seems that you can get a panoramic view of the vast wilderness. Asa sat on a special shelf and reached out and touched the back of the two-legged dragon. It was a large piece of lizard-like scale that could feel the powerful muscles underneath. Although I know that I can never afford it, I can’t help but ask: “When can I sell this for me when I am riding?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the time of the year, more than a dozen lizards have invested their energy and financial resources. Even now, they have only tamed four. How much do you say worth?" General Gru's words are simple and powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A middle-aged man next to him looked at Asa and said, "The magic of young people is very good. Just a fireball has such great power." He pointed to the old man behind him. "Just if it wasn’t for the teacher’s shot, Mr. Cedrus’s baby would suffer.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh?” Asa was a little surprised and asked: “So Some of you are "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are all magicians of the Tower of Tooth." The middle-aged also pointed to several people on the two-legged dragon to answer. "Young people, are you in the Ernest Empire? Look at the people who dress like a magic school."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the time being in the army The priest." Asa answered more and saw these magicians. The Tower of the Tooth is a place of a sorcerer's guild in a religious country in the southwestern empire. Unlike the Magic Academy, although it is purely a country-independent civil society, but all of them are quite advanced elemental magicians are very famous among adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The magic of young people is very tasteful. Are you interested in coming to us to study together?" The middle-aged said to Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't dig the corner. Such a young man with potential is definitely a disciple of Bishop Ronis." The old man said. "But young people, have you been to us? How do I see where you look like I have seen it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? You remembered it wrong. Well, my appearance is very common with many people." Asa vaguely dealt with the past. He knew that this must be the effect of the elves' wanted order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original few days have passed in the middle of the two-legged dragon. Asa also saw the army led by the general on the road. Looking at the sky is like a big team of ants. At dusk, the two Wyverns sent their pedestrians to Oufu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros is very enthusiastic to welcome these magicians to be very happy to see them when they say hello to Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I saw a soldier who had a single order just want to grab it and interrogate about the situation of the unit. But he did not expect to catch him." General Gru Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Asa’s words, Cedros shook his head regretfully and said: “I don’t think it’s the case that a person’s emotional out of control has caused such a consequence. It’s a pity that the innocent 5,000 young soldiers.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It’s not innocent,” Asa said. He now has an indescribable dislike of the enthusiasm of those fighters. "They are also willing to come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros shook his head and said faintly: "Don't say that. Young people still don't know how to see the essence of things." Naturally, it is easy to be fooled by others and leaked. It is really a pity to find death because of these unnecessary reasons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old magician asked: "Do you ask us to come here for this? But you don't think that we can block five thousand soldiers with our air magicians."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Block." Cedrus smiled helplessly. "It's killing them. People who are crazy about anger and hatred can only spread more hatred even if they leave their lives. This kind of emotion will not have any benefit, no matter who." Take a deep breath and summarize again. "So I have to kill them all for the sake of peace in the long run." He turned to look at Asa. "This is the decision we made. I still want to ask you what do you think we should do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa frowned and thought that she only felt an uncomfortable annoyance I shook my head and sighed softly and said, "Kill yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?" asked an air magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros took a thing out of his pocket. This is a round glass with a thick middle and then a thinner edge. "This is a wonderful thing that was given to me by a short craftsman. I have some very interesting phenomena on this." He looked up and said. "Two days after tomorrow, there will be a sunny day without wind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa and several magicians are relatively ignorant of what he wants to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general looked up at the dazzling sun. This is a good weather for the fighting. The fresh air of the plateau and the feeling of the hot sun on the skin will make the people who fight blood more exciting and brave. The orc city named Oufu is not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since that night, the orcs have completely lost their movements and the dragons have only occasionally appeared in the sky. The soldiers were more motivated because of the timidity of these orcs. Although the general knows that there should be a choppy undercurrent behind this calm, but he just "knows" and the already dead heart will not distract from other things. He just wants to rush to fight to hear the orcs' wail and feel those fur and The bones broke down under their own axe and died gloriously. These are the bets of all his spirits. When he started to choose this road, he knew that he could not turn back. He never thought about the victory or the fate of the 5,000 soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a small group of orc troops in front." The foremost soldier on the road is now reporting the target immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general shouted with his bright voice: "It’s time for the soldiers to show our courage and sword for our glory and the hatred of our nation. Kill Light them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers screamed like a wild beast and rushed forward like a hungry wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little orc army began to run but ran very slowly. The soldiers shouted and chased and gradually chased a piece of flat land. The front of the hill was standing upright. There was no connection around the unique hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky suddenly darkened and the original dazzling sunlight suddenly disappeared from the field of vision. The general and the sky that saw him at the top of his head were shrouded in a huge shadow. It is not a cloud or any other tangible thing, it is a pure shadow. The general has never seen such a weird thing. The shadow of one side of the rock in front of it looks like an eccentric hat in the sky at the top of the hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the full of fighting spirits of the soldiers, there was a sudden burst of human voice. The sharpness of this cry is also divided into two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no other emotions in this voice that seem to be just calling for instinct to call the body to tear apart. Once the sound penetrates into the same kind of ear, it immediately arouses the instinctual fear. Even the general is no exception. The general turned back and saw a scene of incredible thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dazzling circular light curtain wanders behind the soldiers. All the things that can burn inside the light curtain burned in a flash. The scalp of the soldiers and the belts of the boots and even the skin, but these flames seem completely weak and almost invisible. Even the dark things in the dazzling light curtain reflected a glaring light that drowned the color of the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air is all stinky. All the people watched with horror as the glare of the light wanted to tell what it was, but it was just pure light. From the huge shadow of the sky, a funnel-shaped light curtain gradually narrowed down and the tip of the funnel fell on the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunshine. This is the only thing the soldier can feel under the funnel of this light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light that originally gave the warmth and life to all things is so strong now. Even if you close your eyes and cover your eyes with your hands, you can't resist the eyes of the soldiers. It seems to have been completely smashed in the blink of an eye. It seems that you have received enough of all the light that this life should have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incomparable brilliance runs directly through their bodies. All the nerves on the skin boiled under the light and twitched so loudly that the pain of piercing the soul allowed them to scream and scream with all the residual power in their lives. Then they smelled the stench of their body and heard their muscles bursting like a fried bean at high temperatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun has been so amiable for a long time that everyone in the room felt the horror for the first time. It is now that the ball that is visible every day is so huge that it is unpredictable. All the things in the Tianwei that poured out seem incomparably weak. The human horses are indistinguishable from each other after this light. Only a few swords are red and release the heat they just received. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers’ enthusiasm and courage just now disappeared under the mysterious Tianwei. The only thing left was the fear that they began to run away. But the light curtains shrouded them on them in an incomparable degree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
