			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the king had to converge on a quiet moment in the darkest time before dawn. Already a whole day of sizzling streets, like the dying convulsions, occasionally a few drunken noises and lights revolving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two drunk young people are helping each other. One has been drunk and the other is a little awake, but there is still the remnant of reason to find the place where the two will settle down. Both of them are very young, and it’s the old-fashioned, handsome and beautiful looking. This is the common figure of Wang Du, and the colleagues I met on the road did not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two young drunks gradually came to the quietest and darkest section. There were also three drunkards who came over in front of them. Everyone is stepping closer and closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three drunks seem to be so drunk that the smell of the wine is full of this whole street. They couldn't even figure out the direction of walking. They almost ran across the street and unknowingly ran into the two drunk young people. At the moment when I was about to hit, the three drunkards suddenly became more familiar with the practice of playing for decades. The hand holding the knife is very professional and the grip is very tight and steady. Just now, the snake-like body in the suede slammed into the leopard and suddenly the two young people who had been close at hand rushed over. The quick movements and the still drunken expression on the face have nothing to do with the smell of the wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade is very short and flashes with green light under the light. There is no blood trough on it because the blood will be weakened once it flows out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three knives slid into the bread as smoothly as they entered the **. The sharp edge of the knife did not make a slight sound in the muscles. Block it. The unique shape does play a role. No blood is flowing out of every point. The toxins are waved out. The enclave should be fully integrated into the body tissue to spread and destroy. Just now, the body full of vitality will stop all vitality. Needless to say, every sign of life that struggles with breathing and heartbeat stops immediately. The last blink of an eye is that the next blink of an eye is waiting for the rotten meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knife is quenched from the tail of the distant Nikon underground world. This strange and intense toxin will immediately paralyze all the nerve tissue as soon as it enters any living body. Even if it can't die, it must not be the poison that the assassin likes most. Moreover, the toxins on these three knives are enough to kill ten of the most majestic horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three bodies are standing upright and the sound of the impact of the wood is just the time of this blink of an eye is completely stiff. The young man who was not so drunk was just taking his own companion and taking a step back and drunk. He pushed these three sensitive and sophisticated assassins and smashed each other. The knife also pierced each other’s body. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness around the darkness flashed out more than a dozen full-length black figure professional steps and movements to make their actions a little louder. These people are holding the same light in the same way. Looking at the companion, lying in a strange position, lying there, there was no slight fluctuation in the eyes of these people. They stared straight into the middle of the two people with the same straight eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until these people stood in the dark, they rushed out of the crowd. This man is very tall and does not wear black clothes. It seems that he is reluctant to cover up the arrogant muscles. He is holding a giant sword that is commensurate with his body. Every step on the ground has footsteps that match his figure. If it is not a bandage on his face, he is like a mighty god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person carefully looked at the two people in the encirclement with the eyes in the gap of the bandage. The culprits that made him bandaged were already drunk and could only stand by the support of his companions. And this companion, even if he has already laid down the three assassins, is still a little drunk, that is not pretending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you?" He stared at the bandage of the drunken man and made him unclear. He waved his hand. "Whenever I don't care, it's okay to kill me. The drunk, don't kill me, I have to deal with him personally." All the black people around him rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are all savage professional assassins. His uncle spends a lot of money from other countries. Only when it is absolutely impossible to use these secret weapons. . Killing such a half-drunken person will never be a problem. As for the drunk, you have to take it yourself and slowly deal with the ribs of the first hand and then pick it up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assassin who was twisted his wrist just broke out with a small sigh of screams, and his voice was immediately interrupted because his body was used as a shield on the shield and his voice was as stiff as the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The humanoid shield then immediately played a huge role in the user's hand. The hand that held a few knives while holding the assassination position also stabbed an accomplice and then swayed a stiff, wood-like leg and hit the broken bones of the companion bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assassins are all masters of coordinated operations. Wandering like a flower in the middle of the sky. As if more than a dozen people around him were arranged for his dodge, he already knew that every movement of everyone was dodging like a wood, and the stiff, wood-like body was also left and right in his hand. The sound of the assassin's broken bones under this strange weapon is steadily falling down by the spurs attached to the shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this humanoid weapon swept the two assassins and swept them out, they were standing next to each other. The big man finally understood the situation. He mentioned that the giant sword in his hand wanted to rush to join the battle group but looked at the ground lying on the ground and the goal he was slowly preparing to deal with again rushed toward the meat on the chopping board. He did not forget that this is the person who really wants to solve. Now the man is still dealing with the remaining assassins. He held up the giant sword and slashed it toward the target. The guy who was over a hundred pounds and his brute force would be as delicate as a petal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Boom’. The slate of the ground is flying. He didn't feel the feeling of chopping the bones and crushing the muscles. He didn't hear the sound of the crack. There was only a strange chill in the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then a warm rush came up to the throat and felt the strange heat wave everywhere. This warm current even began to flow out of the body and extend down the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opponent who was originally drunk on the ground and drunk like a dead dog has stood up. It’s not just standing up, but the eyes of the apples standing there soberly in the eyes of the apples that have been washed cleanly in the ice water are still dripping with blood. That is the blood in his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lost his sword and slammed his throat back as if he could escape the horrible reality. But the blood in the blood vessels is still rushing out of the fingers and rushing through the fingers. Some of them are pouring into the trachea so that he still wants to cough but he can only cough out with some strange squeaky sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sturdy body is now the hay in the cold wind trembled with the terrible sound of this throat. He retreated to the wall and the thick legs could no longer support the body. The snoring in the throat and the trembling of the body along the wall and the tremor of the body continued to flow with the blood flowing from the fingers and finally stopped. The hands that have been soaked in blood have slipped from the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa threw the humanoid weapon in his hand and the last assassin flew out under the strong impact of the gang of stiff corpses. More than a dozen assassins have all been lying on the ground. He turned around and saw the companion who had just succeeded in killing his opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt looked at Syck, who was sitting in the corner. The opponent of this incomparable aristocrat who struggled with his life in the day is now dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rude face in the faint light of the torch scattered on the ground is still solidified. In the extreme fear, the skin lacking blood is loose and deformed to reveal whiteness. As disgusting white. In contrast to this disgusting color, a bright red under the throat is both the evidence of the last life and the label of death. The wound in the throat was cracked very open. It was a bit of a warp. It was a laughing mouth that only faintly saw the tube inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt's face has been somewhat distorted. He suddenly lost the sword and stepped back. The hand holding the sword was pinched twice and then rubbed his hands as if he wanted to get rid of the touch left on it. But the soft and clear feel of the throat just cut still still rushed into the heart not only in the hand but also along the arm. He turned his head and looked at Asa's mouth as if he wanted to squeeze out a relaxed smile, but the handsome face was full of twisted pain and disgust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly bent down and began to vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Killing is by no means a very easy and good thing. If someone really doesn't feel anything, it can only show that he is a piece of wood. If someone thinks it is very enjoyable, it means that he has the same mental problems as those who have fun with their own urine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the gallbladder spit out a few convulsions and gasped a few breaths. Rodhart seemed to finally breathe and gasped and straightened up to wipe his mouth and turned to look at Asa to reveal a somewhat embarrassed smile: "No. It’s really hard to be disgusted to kill someone who kills someone who is really the same.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s smeared his face, though he’s still awkward but his smile has returned. It’s kind and charming. After this extreme fatigue, he still seemed confident that a good student facing difficulties was making up his mind to overcome a difficult problem in learning. "But it's okay. It's like getting measles and slowly getting used to it." He looked at the body of the land and a few deadly assassins were smashing. "So I said that you must help. If I am a dead person, you will save me once again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looks at one place The body frowned and asked: "Why do you want me to help you deal with this assassination? Tell the military ministers about the prime minister to buy you. They will naturally find a way to protect you or simply use this directly. Handle to deal with the prime minister. Now he intends to kill you to destroy the mouth is not more powerful evidence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now is not the time. This handle can not pull down He is just a word of his own." Even if he thinks about these methods, his intimate and supple face always has some naive taste on it, making him look like a child who is confident in his own tricks. "The key is that I have already dealt with this assassination in the past but still don't sue him. So he knows that I don't want to be his enemy and understand that I am not a good person to deal with. Naturally, I will be afraid of me and I will not dare. It’s much easier to do things after psychologically taking advantage of it. Maybe you can have more friends than many enemies.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have changed." Asa sighed. I remember that when he was in Airy, he was still a ignorant teenager, but now he seems to be childish like a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I am mature. I am no longer obsessed with my own fantasy and already know how to face this real world." Rod Hart looked at A Sa smiled that the wound on his lips was still there. "You taught me how to face this cruel world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa feels mixed and shakes his head and doesn't know what to say and sighs. His mood slipped to the bottom with this sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly a strange and huge chill came through the back. It seems as if there are countless ice needles that suddenly pass through the skin muscles and rush into the spine and stab into the bone marrow. Asa turned to the front and jumped out of the air. It was already a big river of lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘噗’. Next to Rod Hart, I heard a sound now. A full-body black figure flashed out of the darkness and stepped on the head of an awkward assassin. The head immediately exploded. By the force of this foot, the man turned into a black lightning that melted into the darkness, and the sharp and sharp tip of the horse smashed toward Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't hide. dead. This is the thought that appears in Asa’s mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is enough to divide the whole night into two. Like a sturdy river from the sky, all the masculine spirits have been condensed for a hundred years, and then the eastward flow to the sea, the impassioned impulsiveness to drown everything in front of us is not left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Asa is already flying back, this long-lasting attack still hits him in an irreparable manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sword does not know how long it has been silently brewed in the dark. Wait until the spirit of the goal is relaxed. The slack response is also the most sluggish when it exposes its own edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s body has been volleyed without any weapons in his hands, only waiting for the call of death in front of him to approach it little by little. All the feelings are sharp and sharp. He looks at the tip of the sword a little bit closer and closer to himself. He can even feel the skin on his face is starting to collapse under this sword. It seems to burst immediately. The musculoskeletal will disintegrate like a dead wood. His head will burst under the sword and splash around like a tomato to the surrounding ground wall.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp I don't want to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa mad. All the strength of the spirit of fear of death and the birth of the ** are concentrated in the hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed the lightning that would immediately smash him. All his life is condensed into his hands. It is not a mere action, but all life to fight death. His hand glowed with a layer of white light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tip of the sword finally stopped when it reached the eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men who landed at the same time Asa continued to push in the black man. The two of them stepped back and forth in the dark long streets and each step was over the thousands of stones and the soil kept flying at the feet of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, the sword can't stand the squeezing of the powerful forces of both sides and break into a myriad of small pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment the sword broke, the black man began to jump backwards and stepped on another seriously injured assassin, and the sound of the broken bones sounded and then he Then bounce back the life of the last assassin cleanly under the soles of his feet. After a few leap, he completely disappeared into the night before dawn. As suddenly as it appeared, there was no trace of sound. It seemed that only a phantom that emerged from the gloom only flashed the fear of his death and immediately returned to nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stands in place. He could hear the blood leached from his heartbeat and ran down the skin slowly under the nose without damage, but the muscles and blood vessels below had broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pure sword of the sword is not with the slightest magic and no magic. Not a killer killer will not use this sword. This is a real swordsman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a real master. This person completely mixed his breath and sway into other people. He may have appeared but did not notice it at all. He has been lurking for a while without any slightest anxiety until the best opportunity to shoot at that moment to show murder. Without a single stroke, he hesitated and he retired immediately. Decide clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell is it?" Rodhart came over and watched the direction in which the man disappeared. He was completely shocked by this sword. He was also a swordsman who saw that the cultivation contained in this sword whispered to him: "This is the last real assassin"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Not an assassin." Asa looked at his palm. The palms were not broken or injured, but the bones were broken and some blood was released. He shook his head and muttered. "Not an assassin"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not" Rod Hart is puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If that sword is stabbing you, are you hiding?" Asa said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt’s face swallowed with a clear answer: “Definitely dead.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Asa said coldly: "It’s dead for you. I can’t stop the sword. Don’t forget that you are the real target of their assassination. As long as you die, their mission is complete. I Life and death are their ass. Isn’t the assassin with such a skill even having this judgment? So he is not against your assassin. It is directed at me.” The night of this kingdom suddenly added a dangerous mystery. The breath made him nervous and every thought. This feeling even made him a little excited like a wolf away from the wilderness and smelled a trace of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa walked over and picked up the hilt of the man who fell on the ground. This is just an ordinary long sword and can be bought anywhere in the king. If this is a good sword, what is the result of a sword that matches that skill? I have just tried my best to block it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why doesn’t this person have a sword of his own? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not with the assassins, how can he know and use this assassination? And why should he kill himself at this time? What if I die now? The sacred sect of the sect of the priest is a great event. When you investigate it carefully, you will immediately know that the key to the origin of these killers is that Rodhart will naturally say things in such a situation that he has indeed squeezed out the position of the prime minister. This world can no longer find a more suitable murderer than the prime minister, but Asa knows that he is not. Who else? Who else can I still have? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed and whispered. However, I am a little happy to find my intellectual confidence. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, the prime minister learned that his nephew had actually gathered his hands to retaliate against the new knight for the loss of the game. Unfortunately, this scum is out. Fortunately, the knight’s skill happened to be the same as that of a church’s priest, and this despicable plot did not succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
