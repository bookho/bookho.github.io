			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maerkang is more than 2,000 feet above sea level. It is difficult to master the fire whether it is fried or cooked. It is not necessary to cook the rice without pressure cooker, let alone pasta. The class, the barely cooked noodles are soft like a paste. Although I haven’t been very particular about eating, I’m known as a bucket, but I can’t stand it. The guy who lives with me is a monster. As long as I eat at home, I don’t even eat anything except pork. I can only solve other foods that I have to solve myself. In the end, I am too lazy to make it together with his meat every day. The meat came over and it was fattened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the bitter cold of the plateau, people here eat more oil and gas, breakfast like a bowl of beef mixed with a small steamed buns or a bowl of stewed trotters . In terms of taste, this style is very suitable for my spleen and stomach, but the high fat content is self-evident. When I eat it, I often think about the fatness of the body. It is a bit thick, which affects the appetite. Also here is the state capital, the consumption is more expensive than Chengdu, a bowl of beef and eight bowls of hoof flowers and twelve flowers, but it makes me endure. Later, I found a place where I sold a six-dollar snack. I was able to have two different treatments. After I was moved, I finally decided not to cook at home, and all of them were eaten here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a few meals to eat, butter tea and monk buns taste good, and sauerkraut noodles, and beef mixed with it is the best thing here. As for the famous hand-caught beef, I originally thought that this kind of arrogant and arrogant like the Liangshan hero can be very enjoyable, but after eating it, I know that a plate of more than two pounds of beef still needs some weight to digest. And the beef was so tenacious that it was comparable to the rubber. After eating it, it didn't even work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the real characteristics of eating, here is still to say red yoghurt and mushrooms. It’s really good goods that you can’t eat anywhere else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hongyuan milk is said to have been an exporter that ordinary people can't eat before. The weight of yoghurt made with yak milk here seems to be faint. Stocks. On that day, I drove back to Malcolm from Blackwater, and I tasted a bowl when I passed the rest of the milk shop. I immediately took a small bucket and went back to plan to taste it slowly. However, the weather in Malcolm was still hot at the time. There was no refrigerator in the residence. It had to be eaten in three days. Unfortunately, none of the guys living together would eat this stuff, only to solve it alone. As a result, even the two days of breathing seemed to have a strong milky taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I left, I took two barrels, one for Chengdu, one for Leshan, and no one could understand the original ecology of the plateau. Frozen in the refrigerator for 10 days. After two days of eating, I went to buy a bottle of Huaxi yoghurt that I used to like, but found that I used to eat the red glutinous rice before eating other blended flavors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the mushroom of Malcolm, it is an eye-opener for me. Every morning, there are Tibetans carrying mushrooms from the mountains on the hills. In the city, these real wild mushrooms can be high-priced rare goods. At least I am reluctant to eat, but in Malcolm. Eat a full meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cheapest is Cyclobalanopsis, two more than one pound, a little more expensive is goose, according to the color of two to four, used to clear Burning incense is very good. As for the most expensive and best to eat, it is naturally the legendary pine mushroom. When I first arrived at Malcolm, it was only 20 kilograms. When I left, I had already risen to more than forty because I had to go down the market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, these mushrooms are not money, the mountains are all grown up, go up early in the morning to go shopping on the mountain, one or two hours to pick up enough to eat. But Matsutake is not so easy. It is only found in pine forests above 3,000 meters above sea level, and it is collected in the early morning. It is not easy to pick people who are not specially collected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Malcon, I spent a period of time on mushrooms, bought mushrooms in the morning, dried mushrooms at noon, collected mushrooms in the afternoon, and accumulated dozens of mushrooms to dry. Dry, or send it to a friend or take it home. Unfortunately, I was not familiar with the method of preservation. The most expensive pine mushroom was dried and not dropped into the bed. I ended up in the room when I left Malcolm. The smell of the shoes was all over the past. Going on, but after returning, I brought the Matsutake to the chicken, but I found that there was no smell...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a heavy loss. On the birthday, I finally cut the newly bought eight pounds of fresh pine mushrooms, and put the knife and roots to go to Changli Temple. Legend has it that this is a large lama fundraising in Beijing, and Jackie Chan’s Zhao Benshan also invested in the construction of the first Malang Lama Temple. Imagine the commemoration of the 27th anniversary of the arrival of the world in the peak of the holy mountain of Changli, which is known as the Buddha's Wonderland. It is an affair that conforms to his status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which knows that this mountain is completely different from the Lushan Big Buddha Temple. If it is not a road sign, I thought it was a barren mountain where the bird did not lay eggs, at an altitude of more than 3,000. More than 20 kilometers of mountain roads, I climbed for four hours without even seeing ghosts on the road. Even the old lama in the temple knew that I was amazed by the way people walked. On the way, in order to walk close to the road to climb the rock wall and drill the woods, even the great bullwhip was forced to give up because of inconvenient carrying, buried in the cracks in the rocky side of the road, only a large cake was taken up in his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
