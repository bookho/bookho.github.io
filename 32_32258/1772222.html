			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight has no brilliance of the magical light, but a silver body full of armor looks equally powerful. Still so handsome and beautiful, the face of the heroic, such as the blonde of the waterfall, is more upright than the ordinary man, in this messy pub is like a statue of a very out of place scene. No matter where it is, people who know her can recognize the knights of the shrine at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were several soldiers on the ground who were smashed and slowly moved away. They knew that they were not opponents, and they also saw that this woman might not be theirs. Can be provoked. The people standing around the edge and outside the pub were watching her pointing and talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horsewoman did not care a lot of bystanders, just three people with apricot eyes on the door, the hand has been placed on the scabbard at the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the female knight just drank in the mouth, Asa did stand still, did not move. Because he knew that if the three of them turned and fled, the horsewoman said that everything would be desperate to smoke the sword and catch up. Although he still has a mask on his face, there is no room to hide the subtleties between the figure and the action. At this time, it is almost the same as a label for a master who has fought and impressed each other. The black elf's dress in the Western desert nomads can marry those who have never seen her, but the Knights of the Temple and her face are not once or twice, and it is absolutely unavoidable to be seen at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you chase and escape in such a broad daylight, according to the style of the female knight, most of the things are only getting bigger and bigger. Even if you can escape in the end, how much will alarm the new cardinal, then everything will be much more troublesome. So even though the Black Elf and Luya subconsciously rushed toward the door, Asa dragged them back one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lord said, give me the favor, I will return." Asa made a courtesy to the female knight. "The Cavaliers are so surprised to meet you here. I believe this must be the guide of the Lord. The Lord guides us to resolve all the grievances and confusions before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The expression on the face of the female knight really began to fluctuate. Eyes also began to change constantly between confusion and sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord said that violence is the worst solution, and all confusion and conflict can be saved in faith and communication," Asa added. "I think it would be better for us to sit down and talk privately, and you know that the worst way can only bring the worst results."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although The meaning of this is very simple, that is, the female knight remembers that she has saved her humanity, and now she has to start to work, she can not ask anything good, so everyone still find a place to make it clear. However, it is really difficult to say that this is not so noticeable in the public. Asa had to thank some of the days when she had been a priest at the School of Magic. Although he did not have the slightest interest in studying the scriptures, he listened to the recitals of the pastors every day and remembered more. I can’t think of this time. use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, I don’t know if it’s because of these days I’ve racked my brains for the things between the two elves. Let the eloquence and random strains that are usually not exercised at all have a solid temper, and this can be played at a crucial moment. In other words, even he himself did not believe that he could actually say such a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I just have a lot of questions to ask you. There are so many people here, let's find a place to talk about it." Talis turned around and swayed Going out, the tavern owner who refused to go to Taizhou seemed to want to speak out, but after all, he did not dare to shout it out. He just looked at the sweaty face on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed and threw a gold coin to the boss. Going out with the horsewoman, Luya and Jessica had to follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This seems to be a self-righteous rigid woman with no brains. Hell, why should I have these fake heads with long hair? I said that I would kill her." The black elf said in front of the background of the horsewoman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the night of the day, Wang Du. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness before dawn is the quietest time of the king, the lights and the voices are silent. Only a very small number of people are still walking in the streets. These people are generally not drunk in the wine, but they are indulgent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
