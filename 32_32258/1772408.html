			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still seventeen and a half days to reach the Deva Valley. This is the time measured by the display of the Elf Magic Map before the last failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the constant advancement of the King of the Necromancer, the creatures that have been entangled in this atmosphere become undead creatures and the huge undead monsters summoned from the bottom of the earth more. The undead army around him is getting bigger and bigger. His own black atmosphere is getting stronger and stronger. Even through the remote sensing of this map, he can experience the feeling of horror. Finally, in the last show, the precious magical legacy left by the ancient elf empire exploded. Fortunately, no matter how large the undead army that embraces the king of the undead, its degree has been constant and his path is equally clear. After coming out of the ruins of the Glorious Castle, he pointed straight to the direction of the Midi Valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ominous atmosphere of the silk finally began to spread in the king. The first thing that came about is the Glorious Castle and then the next chain reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Glorious Castle to the Shadow Mountain Range is not a horse in the wilderness of the wilderness, passing through the territory of two countries. Now these two countries have become a dead land of black soil without any vitality. The news of the Glorious Castle can be blocked and the magical array can be controlled. But the two cars have such a large wind that it is impossible to have an impenetrable wall that can be blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news from merchants from the West is ambiguous but some people have recognized the Paladin and Cardinal who have recently entered and exited the Magic Academy. It is an excellent testimony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School of Magic has been semi-closed. Many mysterious characters who travel from the middle of the magical array every day never go out of the Magic Academy and talk to other people but the momentum of the gestures. The style can be seen very extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of rumors. Someone even quietly guessed how all this was changed by the smog. In essence, it may be a prelude to rebellion. In fact, the Paladin and the prime minister did control all the affairs of the king. The emperor, who was originally a symbolic one, was completely in the palace. If it were not for the two days, the reputation was indeed too high and the other ministers did not have any special reaction. The king had already fallen into a huge chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no one in the School of Magic cares about these things, even the prime minister and the head of Roland are not too concerned. Relative to these rumors, they have to face ten times more headaches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are headaches for them within seventeen days. Concentrate all the forces that can be concentrated and send them to the undead army. Then he gave birth to a road to send Asa and Gru to the king of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the biggest headache is Asa. He never thought that he would have such a headache one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he never thought that he was a hero who could be a leader, but he never imagined that such a person would be so tired. This is too much to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As promised before. The pope seemed to really give everything to him. I don't know what Elder Lloyd said after they came down. Whether the Pope and Lancelot or the two tower owners of the Tower of Tooth have no further changes, this is the default of his status as the leader of the plan. All deployments. Prepare the plan. They are all determined by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it’s on the ancient tree of war, it’s certainly a matter of atmosphere and death. It’s a pity that the problem in reality is never just like the one in the knight’s novel. The horse can be solved by straightening the yellow dragon white knife into the red knife. It was not until this time that he was able to fully determine that he was absolutely not the material for these big things. Even though the Pope and Lancelot did not deliberately blame or even say that they were very helpful, there were enough people to help him with the staff planning statistics and so on. The daily statistical analysis choices still make him unable to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jewish Park refused to send troops. This is excusable in the battle of Oufu. It is an elite. But he promised to provide logistical support to the troops of several neighboring countries. It’s just that his resources are limited. It is impossible for Erasia to take into account who the other smaller Principalities should give to this logistical security?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elazia sent out the 10,000-strongest army configuration with the kingdom of the Knights. The combat power is not critical. The troops of other countries are probably similar to him. Their time is like this..." The priests reported the corresponding information on the map and immediately marked the number of troops marching in each country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elascia's national strength is best provided to several other principalities." Asa thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think it's better to give Elazia better," Lancelot said in a curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elacia’s strength is the most Going out has already made our request. The example of all countries is to give them logistical support at this time to encourage other countries to send troops with peace of mind." The Pope explained. Then I smiled. "Catherine, this woman really knows the affairs of the time... I hope not only because of Hamm's reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the distance from Elazia is also from the distance The farthest. You see here..." Lancelot knocked the flag on the map with criticism, and the officer in charge of the military strategy clearly marked enough information. It’s just that Asa doesn’t understand much, even if it’s difficult to understand. Infer the results. "If they want their own logistics supply, they may not be able to reach the battlefield within a certain time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well then." Asa nodded. This is the sentence he said the most these days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope and Lancelot both explained to Asa as a staff officer. This is definitely the most advanced and most efficient aide in the world. No matter who he is or who dreams, he will not think that there will be plans for them. Unfortunately, Asa still has a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest continued to report: "The Principality of Clos is only willing to send two thousand troops. This is not the most elite Dagong Guards required to be drawn from the ordinary army. Ordinary soldiers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot shook his head and said: "The number of undead souls that are not qualified for the cannon fodder in front of the pile of undead army is never It will be more than the undead that became after death. Finally, it will also waste the purification of the pastors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a soldier but not willing to send troops. There are a lot of magicians and pastors in the Dagong Guards. They must have a role in the battle. Now every strength is precious and must be won."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He Why are you not willing to send troops?" Asa frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Save the strength." The Pope said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this case, still save strength?" Asa couldn't figure it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What the Undead Army and the King of the Dead are too far away for these people to see the income of thousands of gold coins more than a small piece of land. Persuasion. If it is not that the Glorious Castle has indeed fallen and Oufu is also full of troops, these people may not care. Many of the enemies will not spend so much effort to build an elite guard. He is afraid that someone will take the opportunity to deal with him. ...and his ambitions have always been great. If other countries have their own strengths and weaknesses, they still have the ability to conserve. The power of the park can no doubt expand."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... What do you think should be done now?" This is the second most spoken by Asa these days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think I should kill him first and then draft a charge for him to re-appoint the successor in the name of His Majesty the Pope. The Falcon Empire has long existed in name only. The appointment is enough." Considering Lancelot faintly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ambitions and abilities of several brothers and nephews of Dagong are also small. The cohesiveness of the Dagong family is very strong. At least not enough to hinder this action." Power," the pope said suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it’s all killed. Only I personally went to the Lions from Elazia for a long time." Lancelot features. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or use mediation to negotiate and solve the problem." If you just look at this attitude. Asa is hard to believe that this is the bandit and the pope, not the bandit boss like Xi Lika. Moreover, it is impossible for a bandit who is murderous and murderous to kill and kill a grandfather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Using extraordinary means in extraordinary times. Do you think we still have time to play diplomacy slowly?" The Pope smiled a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That doesn't need to kill the family directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
