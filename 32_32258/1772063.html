			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kings are basically in the central position on the territory of the empire. In the east and north directions, you can see that the south and southwest coasts of the coast are composed of several smaller countries and the west is the wild land where the orcs are haunted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accurately speaking, it is not the border of the empire because the wild land does not belong to any country, and no humans dare to settle on the wild land. Since ancient times, there have been various dangerous sub-human habitats. The lizard on the edge of the wolf lizard swamp in the jungle and the ogre tribes scattered around the wilderness. It is said that there are huge ferocious exotic behemoths and eagle eagle in the high mountains to the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crossing the wilderness and going west will lead to caravans in other countries that have always had empire and trade with these countries. Although the merchants have to hire a large number of mercenaries, but also a small half of the team have become the in-country meal of the orcs. In the past ten years, the emperor team began to clear up the beasts, basically sweeping out the orcs on the wild land, and the trade between the empire and the West gradually flourished and even established some small on the edge of the wild highlands. town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blaqada is such a town. At the beginning, it was only a few stations and hotels that gradually expanded into a town with the growing population of trade exhibitions. The caravan where Cliss is located is where the ransoms left by the big-eared murderers in the vicinity are also nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa arrived in Bracada in only 20 days from the king’s day and night. Half a year ago, he and Otaru escaped from the lizard swamp and was on the shore here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a young and somewhat frivolous town. All the buildings have been built in recent years. Most of them were first temporary small hotels and then expanded and expanded due to good business. Even if you plan to make a large-scale project at the beginning, you will never make a big effort. Everyone here is a real passing businessman and a bloody man on the knife. Therefore, the entire city appears to be very crude and has no cultural temperament and subtlety. However, it seems that no one cares about the crowds and the noisy streets that show the unique vitality here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This city is centered on three industries. One is naturally a hotel for people to stay in. The second is the mercenary pub for the caravan to recruit bodyguards. The third is the favorite place for mercenaries and business people to enter and exit. It is said that in order to facilitate the management of the local officials, all the hotel pubs and brothels in the city are combined to operate. Therefore, the three pillar industries are integrated into a town. The hotels with the same style and the rough appearance of each other are all the same. The hodgepodge of the same merchants and prostitutes is the unique and unique folk culture of this emerging place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa went directly to the town hall and when he saw the local official, he took out the appointment document given to him by the Duke. During this ten-day journey, he is now the most useful way to speak. At the beginning, he was still eager to go to the officials of the station to explain that he was the special envoy of the Duke and the officials just looked at him with suspicion. Only one of the guys who showed the instrument was immediately rushed to help him prepare for the wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The local official is still the great Bolugan who helped them. The local officer of Porugan is only about twenty years old. He can be a local official at the age of the local government. He is a dwarf who looks at the wooden wooden brain at a glance. His short head is topped with a huge head. It is like the shape of a puppet played by children. The face like a big pie is very rough and placed with the same huge and rude facial features, black and big eyes straight and straight to the unremarkable attention to all the things that are worth watching. There is no trace of dull ignorance. The avatar is so staggered as a bird's nest. It seems that any combing can't be suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very commensurate with his rude appearance. He’s doing anything and jumping and jumping more and more like an official. Run the hall. I am exactly the same as the style of the city he manages, but it shows the vitality of efficiency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the stupid appearance is not very similar. He still remembers that Asa was the one who floated here with the Duke’s daughter six months ago. After seeing the Duke’s paperwork and knowing Asa’s intentions, he was very surprised to ask: “Is the last princess who was injured?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Not her sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Porugan screamed that he was still sitting on the chair that was a little too big for him. The brows on the broom twisted in the middle. "Mr. Special Envoy, I am afraid that we can't do anything in our place." His voice is a bit like a mixture of ducks and geese, but it is hard to hear but occasionally high in important places. "It seems that the thieves all over the world are gathering here. There are already three or four such things this week." He looked very angry and the short hands were shot at the desk. "Because the wars in the south were originally stationed here two years ago, the local escorts have begun to recruit a large number of recruits but it is still not enough to maintain local law and order. I have also reported to the court to ask for troops from the south. I suggest that you also wait for the reinforcements to come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolugan jumped out of the chair and said to Asa: "You'd better not slap the big ears. They don't know why they are suddenly violent. They used to be thieves to grab some small money and some to do something. Just on the road. But I don’t know what happened recently. It’s not just robbery. If you encounter resistance, they will also use a knife to kill someone. If you are unfamiliar with your own life, I can’t afford anything if there is something wrong.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa said: "You don't have to worry about this. I just hope that you can tell me what happened in the recent period."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "En" Bolugan adults start to the left of the broom brows on the forehead wrinkled almost to stand up as if thinking hard. After walking for a while, he suddenly ran to the door of the room and looked around and closed the door to Asa. His height only looked up at Asa's chest and looked at Asa probably felt pressured to point to Asa's chair. "Mr. Special Envoy, sit down first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sat down on the chair, but he slammed on the table and was higher than Asa. I used the big, big, drum-like eyes to look down and said: "Mr. Special Envoy is not saying that when you see you, I feel that you can’t hate the officials who are sent to other kings. You know that you know. The civilians came out and went up with their own personal efforts. So I think your thoughts must be more open. I only quietly discuss one thing with you. I dare not talk to others about this. I am the local official here. The people's nanny can't guess the rumors indiscriminately. But this thing is really weird." The face of Bolugan's adult approached Asa's big mouth and the nose of the pig's nose. "You know that our laws do not stipulate that the big-eared monsters are not citizens of the empire, so they are generally not polite to them. The thief can only count as soon as they hear the news that they have done something bad. The army immediately Killing their villages and killing them is not left. So those green-skinned guys are generally not afraid to mess up. But now they are suddenly so mad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean that someone is behind them to support them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one." The eyes of Bolugan’s eyes are bigger and seem to be Flying out of the eyelids and knocking the opposite person down to the ground. His face is getting closer to the sound, although he tries to press it, but it is also the voice of the duck that is so low. "In the past two months, we have had strange rumors. I heard that a large city is being built in the depths of the wild. It is also a city of the orcs. I heard that there are werewolves lizards and ogres. They are also planning to join the alliance of the orcs. They are determined not to survive in the corners of human society, so they have no scruples at all, so they suddenly become so bold that they have to get a big ticket when they leave. I also heard that they had transported the stolen goods and money to the depths of the wasteland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he finally shrank his head back but suddenly Sighed again. "I know this news is ridiculous and I don't even believe it. The news was originally spread in the trail but it is now a bit full of wind and rain. How is your face so ugly?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa coughed and re-adjusted facial expressions as if casually said: "There should be no such thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There shouldn't be, but if you have what you think about it, what kind of information is there. I have also reported the rumors here, but the above did not completely reflect the officials who went to see and inspect them personally. Oh, I have a problem with my head. I am not enough people here to send someone to the depths of the wasteland to explore. I can only tell you this news. After you bring the Duke to the Duke, talk to the Duke and see if you can Sending troops to come over"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly a loud knock on the door was shouting outside: "Polugan is not good and a caravan is robbed." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloogan adults jumped off the table and sweared a swearing idiom. He opened the door and turned to Asa and said, "Sorry, the special envoy, please take it easy, let me deal with it and come back." Then he followed the people outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sat there. The fact that the orcs that he had seen half a year ago is likely to be true. If the big-eared monsters really carried the goods there, if the book was unfortunately mixed in, he began to pray that Klis would like the book very much and carry it in the underwear when he was carried with him. stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it’s just an inconspicuous book, and no one would think it would be worth much. The big ear geek will never go to the book when the robbery is taken. Perhaps this book is still in the hands of the caravan, just go to the redemption of Cris and find someone to get it. It’s a lot easier to think of Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
