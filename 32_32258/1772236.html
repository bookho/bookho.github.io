"In any aspect, you are growing up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was originally you. You are the necromancer lurking in the kingdom. You are stealing. Sand's book and clothes. I can't think of it... Even the Bishop of Ronis didn't feel you." Asa looked at the Marquis. Even if I have reached this point, even though I have almost died three times under this person's hand, it is hard to believe that Asa is the most fascinating and savvy. The first genius is actually a Necromancer. . Moreover, he was a good friend of Bishop Ronis, who has been living in the eyes of the entire kingdom for so many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it doesn't matter if you don't believe it. The facts are already in front of his hand with a ring that is dying, and he can put the poisonous needle into her body at any time on the shoulder of Xiaoyan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis said faintly: "People usually lax their things under their own eyes. Not to mention that Bishop Ronis is almost from a boyhood, he naturally does not I will beware of me. The key is that I did not deliberately disguise him in front of him. I did take him as a friend... until he died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stunned Suddenly asked: "Is the death of Bishop Ronis also related to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis just smiled a little blankly and did not directly answer but said: "From the mood I really don't want him to die. My friends are not many. In fact, if it is not a position and some inevitable reasons, we can actually become friends. Unfortunately..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small body has been though - 堑茫 壑 壑 壑 壑 壑 髀 髀 隼 丫 丫 丫 丫 丫 丫 抟 醇 醇 醇 醇 醇 醇 醇 醇 醇 醇 醇 - - - - - - - - - - - ∽ ∽ 菏 稚 稚 稚 稚 稚 稚 稚 稚 & & & & & & & & & 土 土 土 土 土 土 土 土 土 土 土 土 土 土 土 土 土 土 土 土 土 土 土 土 土 土< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, I am still not your friend. You have been lurking so deep so secretly, but now you have to rush out to reveal your identity. There must be something unexpected." Asa Speak slowly. He looked at the Marquis' eyes and was all bloodshot. His muscles and nerves were already tight and the spirit was completely locked in the other side. As soon as he has any chance, he will immediately shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The accident is you. I have seen the traces of your escape from the cellar. If I guess well, you have used the real meditation to penetrate the sun well and the world. The power of the leaves of the tree. This is also the proof that the spiritual level is beginning to mature. So I can't let you run away anyway, otherwise it will definitely be endless. Things will be completely out of my control. I know you are running away. I will come to some place first, so I will come with the fastest speed.” Hou Jue smiled a bit. "But I still have some miscalculations. I thought I could have made you directly but I couldn't think of it... You are really much more mature than before. I am wary of me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Asa said: "These are all thanks to your son. To be honest, he didn't give me frustration and stimulated me to go beyond this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The Marquis nodded faintly and said: "Normally a good enemy is easier to grow than ten friends. In fact, without you. He will not achieve today."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa saw the eyes of Xiao Yan looking at her doubts. Sighed and explained: "I was just telling you that the new cardinal, Jarvis, was the former Clause. The great father saved him from the chaos that your father caused. He brought him to the Necromancer Society and gave him a face and identity. This time he came back to get back what he had lost before including him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ok, no longer have to delay the time in these chats. You can rest assured that there will be no rescuers coming to the ground. The guards at the door don’t even know that I have come in under the magic of the mind. Now this king is in. It seems that no one is there. Can help you. If you want to distract my attention and spirit, it is a waste of effort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A drop of sweat dripped from Asa's chin on the floor on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really as the Marquis said. Even if he constantly tries to seduce the other party and wants him to distract him, Asa has no way to find any chance to shoot. The Marquis is still in such a casual position. It doesn't matter what the momentum is, even the muscles on the body are loose. But Asa knows that no matter what method he uses, he can press the hand with the life ring in the small 懿. On the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica’s body stopped. The direction in which the Marquis stood was originally to face her. She has been quietly approaching the distance that can be shot. But before this step, the other party saw a warning to be sure that the warning would not be just a bluff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If your goal is to control me now, it will be achieved. What do you want to do next? Do you want me to commit suicide?" ask. He knows that maybe this time he really has nothing to do. In fact, even he himself was confused because he didn't notice how Jessica slowly approached the Marquis, but the Marquis, who was completely facing her, could clearly feel it. This has already shown that whether it is in the mental state of mind or in the ability to perceive, etc., it has indeed fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This opponent is the least oppressive of all the opponents that Asa has encountered. It seems that it is also the least combative. But Asa is absolutely certain that he is the most dangerous one because he is also the most unpredictable one. A snake that can hide behind you for so long is far more terrible than a beast with claws and claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Suicide? Of course not even if my purpose is indeed your life, it is impossible to mention this request. No one knows whether people will be for feelings. I must give up my life..." The Marquis let go of the hand that had been holding Otaru and reached out and took two transport reels and threw them to Asa. Otaru still couldn’t move under his black magic. The Marquis’s hand with the ring still hadn’t left her shoulder. "But I have enough confidence to be sure. As long as there is still a glimmer of hope to save her, you will never give up. Let's open the two transfer reels together. How?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa took the reel. Such a transfer reel, he saw a small purple on both ends of the saw. He smiled and said, "You want me to go to Deya Valley with you? What is the difference between this and the suicide?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course there is a difference. Suicide, you may hesitate this way, you will not refuse. We both open the reel at the same time and say that they can be sent away at the same time. You can rest assured that Mulak Miss is not my purpose. I don't want to be hated by the kid because I killed her. I have already owed him a lot." The Marquis smiled at Asa as if he was comforting him. "Know that I won't necessarily kill you. At least I will let you go to see someone before you die, let you tell her what she believes is wrong. And you should have confidence in your strength. Maybe you I can still kill me by flattening the power of the sun well and the leaves of the world tree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is your good fortune "Asa slammed the scroll. He did not choose this is the only way. "Then you count the three times and we pull the transfer reel together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One, two, three." Marquis shakes his body with Asa at the same time A blue glow is emitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the transmission will be transmitted simultaneously at the same time as the duration passes. The smile on the face of the Marquis is more splendid and more chic. But just before the transfer of the upcoming blink of an eye. The expression on the face of the Marquis instantly solidified. His eyes changed from the sun. A cold cry: "Looking for death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't go." Asa screamed at the same time but slammed into the Marquis Blue's transmission. It was finally dissipated when the effect was about to happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black elf behind the Marquis’s leaping pounce on his body like a wall crashing into an invisible wall. At the same time, she screamed that her slim waist, which was as strong as a panther, full of strength and temptation, broke open silently from the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Asa’s breakthrough in transmitting the magical Marquis’ eyes reveals great anger and disappointment but I don’t know because it’s caused by the blade barrier. stiff. Still his own slight hesitation, the hand on the shoulder of Xiaoyan, after all, did not have time to press his figure and disappeared under the effect of transmitting magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica’s body is divided into two segments that fall in bloody and broken internal organs in different directions. Asa only had time to catch the warm blood of her upper body and soaked his body. He only felt that somewhere in his heart seemed to have broken into two halves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can the bastard do this..." Jessica spit out two words. The expression on her face was distorted by fear and pain but it seemed to be like Still with some helpless smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa strongly suppresses the sorrow and fear of the archery to take the body out, and combines the broken waist of Jessica with the fastest White magic power is all out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
