			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no figure in the wide cathedral now. It has been temporarily listed as a Paladin of the Forbidden Zone. Nearly a hundred swordsmen and magicians are outside and no one is allowed to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the entrance of the cathedral, Asa took out the long sword of the head of Roland and showed the two captains before letting him in. The Paladin has never been a guardian of martial law. These short-term affairs are also difficult to find a suitable unique permit for the permission of the head of Roland. So the head of the Roland team temporarily gave the long sword to Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such temporary measures are indeed necessary because the things in this time are really important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred and solemn idol in the center of the front of the cathedral has been removed from the pedestal, and the darkness of the mouth is as big as a monster slowly moving the stomach. The deep smashing atmosphere of the ministry came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa took a deep breath and sneaked into the dark mouth. Even if he came in for the first time, the taste inside made him unbearable, but he immediately realized that it was useless to breathe in the smell of rotten cotton. Walking along the steps to the next step, the strange touch is like a static wind condensed by magic elements. This is the feeling of crossing the magic enchantment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it feels more acute. This time, Asa passed through the magical enchantment that filled the space, and Asa had some weird intuition. This magic enchantment doesn't seem to be set up to protect it, but it's hard to figure out what's wrong with him but not so good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going down the original monsters that were pervading the dungeons, there is no longer the sound of Mars that is constantly emerging from the torch to give some life in this silence. In addition to this, there is only one gasping in this confined space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gasps are loud but give people the feeling of life and vitality. It seems that this is more like a wind-drawn suitcase that is constantly agitating. But this is because the sound of only one person's breathing can even be heard and the sound of the sound is swept away. This voice is not painful, but Asa has inexplicably felt that the hair behind her is upside down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the broad dungeon, only the torch of the torch on the wall, Asa, entered the hand and immediately doubled the dungeon. But even the light inside is really limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only two people are present. One is sitting in Sandru and the other is Javey lying on the ground. The huge gasp is from the mouth of Jarvis. This is not long ago. The red cardinal is now indistinguishable from a dead dog. In the darkness of the fire, his face contrasts with the dark ground. He is afraid that both eyes are squatting, but no matter who looks at it, he will only think that this is the two glass beads without the slightest anger on it. If it weren't for him, he would still breathe Asa and would never think he was still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought he could still insist that I put his head in the asshole and know where this is the limit... but my white magic is not good. I am afraid to drive him crazy. Otherwise, it will be much more wonderful." Sandru, who was sitting on a wooden bench, kicked Javy on the ground. But Jarvis did not respond. There is a large pool of water on the ground that should be the sweat he left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javi’s body can’t see any scars at all, but Asa knows that it’s completely meaningless to have a bleeding skin in the hands of a man like Sander. . Even if a thousand people can be saved in his hands, then how can you keep feeling the pain of a knife and a knife without hurting and not dying naturally? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked at Javey’s face that had been no different from the dead and sighed slightly. Asked, "So, did he recruit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shandro sneered and said: "Awesome. I can say that he said otherwise orland." How could the kid leave? But this kid is also ignorant. I used to do it. He said everything he said. He also knows that in my hands, he can't win anything and even want to die." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then he has become like this?" Asa stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father debts. There is no way to catch the guy who dared to frame me. Naturally, please ask him to help him take responsibility. I know this. The kid used to be confident in his own means of punishment. Today I let him see what it is like to be the true style of Deya Valley." Shandru seems to be cold and snorted. "But this is only temporary. I have a chance to go to Yagu to find his Laozi to calculate the account. The few guys in Shante want to come up with the same nostrils as the kid to let the kid run around." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ending the confrontation with the Marquis, he has made up his mind to counterattack. So he let Xiaoxuan stay in the Prime Minister's Office and pretend that nothing has been born to confuse them. He himself went back to the hotel to take out the spare mask and dressed up and sneaked back to the Magic Academy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Sandro is the trump card he has been relying on. Even if this strange old man has always been the scent of the high-hanging slogan, Asa believes that it is his turn to shoot when he is shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after returning to the School of Magic, he did not find Sandru in the library but guessed from other populations what the old man had. Thousands of rushing things went out and I heard the strange behavior of the Cardinal adults in the cathedral. More importantly, in order to prevent the return of the Marquis, he sent a magical array to inquire. When the Marquis did not return, he originally wanted to take the initiative to destroy the transmission of the magic array, but now the magic array has been destroyed. I think this is related to the sudden disappearance of Sandru. Together, I understand that this must be adjusted by the Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And before he even wanted to let him know that the true meaning of this tiger’s departure from the mountain was later, the horse was uploaded by the Queen Cardinal and the Knights’ Agent to call all the ministers. The news of our emergency meeting. Asa knows that this shows that Javy has not been able to keep up with his own ignorance and the Marquis. I am ready to put everything to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he knew that this was a dead end for himself, he had to go. Now he is the only force in this kingdom that can have a slight impact on this situation. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also knows that this situation, by which he can never reverse the situation, must be resolved by relying on the head of Roland or Sandru. He vaguely feels that Sand's rush is bound to be because Roland, but the transfer of the magic array is already destroying what he thinks is undoubtedly the means of delaying them. So his only way is to drag and try to drag. Drag until they come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he first tried to get Talis out of the prison and let her wait for Jarvi at the School of Magic. Try to delay him as much as he can. Although this method is actually taking the risk of the female knight's life, but in this critical situation, Asa's own safety can not be scrupulous and can not manage so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plan is indeed dangerous and there are too many uncertainties. After Asa arrived at the temple, the queen’s seal had been sealed by the white magic of the body. The dark fluctuations in the body were suppressed to the lowest vampire but were so banned that it was harder than the drip. Suddenly understood that the Queen is not their accomplices have become a tool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it really has no way to go or the spirit is a more mature relationship. Asa is more calm and calm. He immediately thought of a solution. If it wasn't for Javi, he would wake up halfway and come back. The situation may have turned around at the time. Even after Jia Wei came back, he has always occupied the scene and actually took the initiative to drag back to Sandru and Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Asa really did his best, but the end of this victory actually came down to a strange luck... Space scroll used by Necromancer . If it is not so in accordance with the Marquis-designed conspiracy Sandu is now a rotten meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis is full of charm. At any time, there are charming smiles and intoxicating faces that come to the mind of Asa. At the same time, the nature that emerged from the plots of those who came from his own hands, but all of them were arrogant. Until now, he couldn't connect this person with these things in a sense. He sighed and said: "So you also asked his father to actually kill the black hands behind the Bishop of Nice?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course I asked. But the specific method still doesn't know that he only guessed that he used the Duke of Mulak." Sandro indulged in the light of his eyes. . "This guy is too dangerous. To be honest, I didn't even think that this guy's plan actually had such a deep approach. There was such a sinister thing to do. It didn't leak out. It seemed that everything was as expected. If it wasn't my luck. I’m afraid it’s hanging. I’ve been feeling for the first time for so many years, and I’m not because of the strength of this guy.” He snorted again and became a murderous murderer. "Great, this guy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is he doing for this? Did you ask it?" Asa asked. The things behind these things he hadn’t wanted to know, but it’s not a bad thing to know more about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twenty years ago? What happened?" Asa immediately remembered something he had heard long ago. "Twenty years ago... Was it that Verdina became a lich? You are leaving the Descartes? What else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain Drew’s eyes frowning suddenly made Asa suddenly shut up. This look seems to have some fire, but more of it is something that is not very understandable. But he didn't say anything but just closed his eyes again and sighed heavily. The depressed and heavy voice echoed in the basement for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa hesitated. No openings. He knew that since Sandu didn't want to say that he asked him to ask for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time Sandro opened his eyes and asked: "What happened to the above?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The above thing?" Asa stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nature is the damn emperor's queen, what else is there for the minister's court." Sandro sighed again. He has been sighing very little. These two sighs are heavy and dull. "Fuck. If the group of Descartes knows me, the old bastards know that I am going to worry about these things and I must laugh at the big teeth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa Gang I want to say that I have hesitated to look at Jia Wei on the ground. Sandron snorted: "You can treat him as a dead person now and don't worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, there is nothing much to do afterwards. Since the culprit has been arrested, the Queen has been cured by me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru seems to suddenly point to Asa and ask: "You How is it cured? Tell me not to play tricks. I don't have time to look carefully at what you are doing but I know that no one can turn a vampire into a human."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled and replied: "I only said that she was cured and she let her recover her mind. But she did not say that she changed her back to someone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sandruyi: "Then you are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A seed you said yourself became a plant and naturally there is no way to become a seed again. But don't change it back to the seed just to make it look like a seed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra suddenly nodded: "Oh. You are She...has become other undead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is similar to something between zombies and vampires. It retains the ability of complete consciousness and free movement but it does The vampire's instinct for blood and most of the material is erased. Now it is all the magical power of the dead. Whether it is her own cultivation or someone to deliver to her, she can sustain her life. "Sbrecht nodded. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because there is no other way to do it, so it is only so desperate. I have no chance to succeed. I will not succeed in the future. Let her come into contact with things like white magic and holy water, and I can continue to squat. I have no reason that Roland and the prime minister should have their arrangements."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is not counted The solution to the problem was completely solved, but it was also considered to be <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru kicked the ground and called Javy. "What about the gang of this kid? How to deal with it?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well..." Asa thought about frowning and shaking his head. "That boy... Although the head of Roland wanted to kill him, but the Queen came forward to protect him and he did not go out with the Bishop Jiawei at the last minute. They also thought that he was only coerced and tempted. So in the end, the leader of Roland was only Exiled him to dismissal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't kill him?" Shandru raised his eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed and shook his head: "He also has his hardships anyway. He shouldn’t be able to do anything anymore. Since they have let him go. What are you going to pursue?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru asked with a cold cry: “And what about the rest?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
