			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone is careful." Just as Axis pulled out a reel, several elf sorcerers who felt the magical fluctuations shouted loudly though they I don't know what the scroll is, but the huge and weird magical fluctuations are no worse than the hellfire. "Everyone is going to shoot the magician down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shouting focused everyone’s attention over the hundreds of archers around them immediately The thief who was in charge of defense around Aisisi clenched the big shield in his hand and shrank the whole body behind him. Even a hair would not dare to show it. The six-sided shield immediately formed a ring-shaped wall that dripped the water and sealed Aisisi firmly inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there is no arrow that shoots on their shields. The elves have no habit of shooting shields. This kind of shield against the cavalry and the archer is really big enough to be the door panel, but the difference from the door panel is that it is not an overall cuboid. In order to facilitate the ca underground cavalry, the charge is reduced to a triangular tip at the bottom. There is no way to put together this switch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six thieves screamed like a pig. There was no injury on their body but the arrow was full of arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six thieves immediately fell to the ground in the screams. It is not that their willpower is not strong enough, but because their feet have completely lost their standing role, the muscles inside have been cut open under the arrow. As long as the elf archers who can aim are shot at the place where my ribs are connected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After falling down together, Axista also inserted a dozen arrows on his feet. Fortunately, there are several thieves in front of you. Did not directly ruin him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long scroll on the hands of Aisisi was still open when she fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reel is in the light. The magical power of the raging water flows from the reel into the surrounding air. Then the singer reeled into a full day of debris. Everyone can feel a wave of swaying from their body and face. Many thieves and elves have squatted with their hands and waited for the big bang or other horror effects expected from the reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nothing has exploded without even a little bit of light and other noises. This reel brought to the battle as if it were just a short pause caused by surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf archer slammed and immediately continued to shoot the bow. In a flash, dozens of feather arrows came out of the string. But these should have broken the blazing arrows. Now it's like a piece of paper that has become light and fluttering in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves stayed and someone immediately took the arrow and shot again. But the arrow from the string is still so slow and can't fly as much as it falls. The elves were in a hurry to check that the bow and arrow bow on the hand were still tight as the new arrow was intact. It seems that there is no problem anywhere but all the arrows are not far off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Massachusetts-sized wasps, who are flying in the air and screaming at the thieves, are suddenly slamming down one by one. The wings of these wasps are still fanning, but they can't support their bodies anyway. In the blink of an eye, apart from the unicorns that rushed into the thief group and the poisonous insects summoned by the elf wizards on the ground, there was almost no more damage to the thieves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The art of magic..." Ai Sisi fell to the ground. Although there were still ten arrows in the calf, the face was sore in the sweaty facial features, but I couldn’t help but swear. However, under the effect of this magic, his voice sounded extraordinarily strange like a group of cotton stuck in his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an original magic that does not exist in the air magic system. This large range of large air magic has almost no magic to achieve this magic effect is also unique, it does not have any lethality. Even the one that has no effect on anyone or thing is the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it going to affect the air? I don’t know why even the air has such a substance. He only knows the description of the reel and the feeling of magical fluctuations. The faster the movement around the air after using this reel, the greater the resistance and the adhesion. That means all the long-range attacks will be within the scope of this magic. invalid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika’s face is not as intoxicating as Aisi. From the time he got these reels, his calculations were constantly changing but no matter how it changed. All the changes were made with a reel but the subsequent changes made him change his mind. The man’s arrogance made him intolerable and decided to let the few go to the elves alone and then sneak from the other side and use the scrolls to gather the elves. But I don’t know why the elves didn’t seem to be The side battles attracted the sneak attack in the past and became the following encounter. The elf's fighting power and reaction have made him completely give up the plan to fully occupy Tula Leone. The key is that he has to use the reel here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves are not horrified. At this time, there are already twenty or thirty elf wizards gathered around the thieves. The wizard wizards sang the spells. The grass on the ground grew wildly and instantly became a thorny vine that strangled a thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poisonous worms that emerge from the trees in the grass are much larger. And these little things are more active with the increase of the Master's spells and the increase of the Elf Mage. The thieves are madly rushing toward them like they have seen the food they haven't seen for decades. Exciting eccentric snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thieves have been very careful that these seemingly dangerous poisonous insects don’t dare to bite in any way, but they should be overwhelmed. A thief was finally bitten by a huge green and blue squat on the upper board and immediately screamed. In fact, he is not hurting that foot immediately without any feeling that he is scared and screaming. Anyone who sees one of his legs becomes as thick as the waist like a flatulent scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a companion who had a savage moth in his hand and immediately slapped the blood that had not been like a leg. But this blood is not just red, but with a bit of blue and green like that one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This colorful bright blood splattered to the companion who helped the companion immediately and the screams were more miserable than the bitten person. The blisters on the hand seemed to have been thrown in boiling water to cook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spells of the Elf Masters have not stopped for ten years and the trees have begun to move under the magic. It will soon become the huge dead wood guard. At the same time, the unicorns coming to this side are also increasing. This kind of horned Malaysia is even more difficult to deal with than the lion tiger. At least ten thieves can deal with one. The thieves disappeared because of the resurgence of the reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, Aisi Si, who was lying on the ground, took out the second scroll under the instructions of Hilika. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s just a surprise to the first reel wizards, then the scrolls are scared when they come out. The huge magical fluctuations that contained the decay of decay and darkness made them feel instinct and fear instinctively. Two elf screamers shouted: "Everyone temporarily retreats."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the air that was thickened by the first reel made all the elves move It became slow and did not let them run a few cloths. This reel has already been opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scroll seems to be a strangely pottery of Klein in the hands of Aisisi and seems to be a magical fountain. A black magic wave constantly spurts out from inside. This black wave ran down on the ground and spread quickly. The ground of the nearly 100-meter fairy was completely blackened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poisonous worms that are as active as eating ** thieves who are crying and screaming are just touching the black ripples and immediately falling and then shrinking into the original The appearance of the final turned into fly ash. Even the trees that had just become dead guards began to wither. The elves who came into contact with this black corrugation just fell to the ground in pain, squatting freely and crawling toward the front, hoping to try to escape this black category. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the pain is still the elf Master, only five or six can name the chanting mantra to add a layer of green magic light to himself, but still fall down of. Most of them are directly vomiting blood lying on the ground and convulsing. The power contained in this black ripple is completely incompatible with their natural attributes. Directly smash the magical power in their bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only those unicorns can still support but also rushed out of the thieves who rushed out of the black ground and rushed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grass on the ground under the black corrugations is also withered by the naked eye. Everything is slowly cut off in this black. decay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thieves are also very difficult to suffer from the nausea of ​​the chest and abdomen like drinking sewage in the gutter. But compared to the elves, it’s completely a dragon. This black ripple is not very effective for ordinary humans and the thieves have precautions under the orders of Hilika. Before entering the enchantment, each thief had a small piece of carrion on his stomach and ate it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most spiritual thing is that Helicia’s body of red scented light is unaffected in this black area. Although he knew that these two scrolls were specially designed to deal with the elves, but they did not expect the effect to be so good, not only immediate but also to see the money. The elf that fell to the ground is wealth. The thieves under his opponent yelled: "Give me a quick catch for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
