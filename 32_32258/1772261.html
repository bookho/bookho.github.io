			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I see the dust of this star because of Hamm? I know that you are versatile, especially between the magical array and the magic material. The application is probably already a big 6 top." The Pope looked at the Marquis and said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis thought about it and replied: "Respond to the squat. According to the dust of this pile of stars, I think...this may be a whole good one. The eye of the star. The scattered dust of the star has no other effect except the power of the eye of the corresponding star. The control of space magic is the worst. The power of the gem of the star cannot resonate with each other so no matter how many stars are dusted together. It is also impossible to have the power of a fragment of a star, so that it is impossible for the dust or fragments of the star to be left behind only after the use of an eye of the whole star."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also see this with good eyesight." The Pope nodded slightly. "But I am very surprised how the elves used to make such a precious star's eye a bunch of broken ends.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their entire family suddenly disappeared Is there a relationship?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince smiled and replied: "This is pleased, please forgive me, I can’t see the ignorance."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope saw the Marquis and sighed softly. "According to the Tamik Knights, it’s not just that the elves have disappeared. Even the war tree in the forest of Tulain has disappeared. It is the legendary treasures of the ancient times that were rumored by the five hundred years ago. The seedlings found by the elf queen Ishabel from the ancient ruins were poured out in the water of the sun wells from the whispering mosque before they grew up in Tula, when the young Pope Saint-Julien and the Elf Queen were personally intercourse. It’s good that he recorded these in his personal notes. Although I have seen it, I didn’t expect that the ancient tree of this war could have the ability to withstand the mages of the Descartes. I was surprised... Originally I also hope to have a good communication with them. I know that the Tamiki Knights have just arrived in Tula, and they are already an empty forest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Adela can't help but look at the face of the Tamek Knight. The ‘communication’ that he is directly accustomed to is the only thing that the Pope can always represent in the shadows is that he can understand without thinking. Although Lancelot returned in Tula, but also brought back the news of the leaf of the world tree. Plus the tremendous power of the ancient trees of war. These things are light enough to make some disgraceful means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope looks to the Marquis and asks: "Celeister's magical books are numerous, but the records of space magic are very rare. I also watched it. It is concluded that this is the dust of the eye of the star, and the dust of the elf is also known to be related to the disappearance of the elves. But the reason for this is not guessed. Because Ham can you see what is there?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis still smiles and shakes his head: "I really can't see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you too modest, are you not present?" This smile is not the same as before. There are some unrecognizable excitement and whistle that are unwilling to cover up. The smell of the cold atmosphere in the study seems to be sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis just bends over and smiles slightly, although his posture is very respectful, but the smile is still graceful and full of temperament and not humble: "Some little tricks I really don't dare to make axe in the front door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope does not speak. He did not look at the Marquis. Just staring at the broken ends of the star of the star that I was holding in my hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a half-hearted silence, the pope finally opened his eyes and looked at the Marquis and said, "Inham.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Celester is not good for the battle of Oufu during this time. Not only is the country of Elassia and other soldiers lost, but even several Knights of the Temple and Bishop Essar are unfortunately killed and now lack of land in the Glorious Castle. It’s those who can be independent... You’ve been a Celeste anyway, and you’re interested in being a cardinal in Elazia?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, even the face of the Marquis could not help but reveal the color of surprise. Adela Bishop was surprised that he could not himself. Only the Tamek Knight behind the pope is still a face of wood as if it were just a sculpture like a human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly stunned. The Marquis only kneeled down. "Thank you for your appreciation. I am willing to offer everything for the Lord's glory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
