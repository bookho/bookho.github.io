			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is still wrapped in the electric light that has been affected by lightning. But when it is halfway, the electric light has dissipated and turned into white magic. The slamming sound of this man fell on a towering old tree and actually struck a bucket as thick as a bucket and then slammed it and fell with a bunch of branches and leaves in front of Asa. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s quite good to be able to fall from the height of hundreds of meters without falling to death. He staggered and stood up and saw Asa rushing to open his mouth but couldn't tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa has already seen this person who fell in the air is Abin, and he can see that although he sees some clues from his body movements, He seems to have not recognized himself because he changed his mask. But he did not speak and did not stop or continue to plunder the war tree. You don't have to look back to hear the footsteps behind you. This is not the time to greet acquaintances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colorful spot suddenly swayed the muscles of his body in Asa’s body, and the body shape of his body rushed. A meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drink." A big drink is in the shape of a moment. Asa’s body is lit up with a dazzling ray of light. This paralysis is almost exclusively produced. A blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s that the blink of an eye has made his figure lose its balance in the shape of a flying body. The Tamik Knight chased after him has turned into a gray figure toward the back of his back. The black fangs of the gray figure are whistling like a thousand years of evil spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paralyzed reel made by His Majesty the Pope can only be exchanged for a half-blinking time. The Tamik Knight has to admit the strength of this opponent. But this half-baked effort is enough. He has done all his efforts, at least except for Lancelot, who has never been able to take his full blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the footsteps are unstable, the distance is pulled closer and the back is brightened to others to escape. Asa reluctantly stood and gathered to just resist the Tamik Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two knives intersected but only came like a pair of noodles colliding and then the Tamik Knights stepped back a few steps. Asa flew directly. Go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abbie shook a little and felt uncomfortable. I want to spit. He didn't stand too close, and they didn't have any amazing temperament leaking out. But the two soft knives that hit each other with black knives seemed to be directly drilled. The human brain irritated a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The branches and leaves of the trees within a radius of more than ten meters centered on the two-person strike. And when the branches are still normal, the green leaves fall to the ground and have already withered. The grass on the ground is already rotted into slag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa, although flying out, but has no ability to turn around and flee until the back hits a big tree and makes a muffled sound. After the big tree stopped the waist, the body shape stopped and opened his mouth. It was a large mouthful of blood that spit out the black bloody face like ink but white like paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good! Go to hell." The Tamik Knight stood firm. There was also a hint of blood on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is so convinced that he has not met anyone who can hurt him except for Lancelot for at least ten years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the word behind death is the kind of forgotten fighting spirit that has finally been provoked. This rare person will die soon. Even if he himself has been hurt, the other party will only hurt more. The curse of the Necromancer attached to the knife is mixed with the power of his grudge and the power of killing to kill a Bimeng. He saved forward. This time, the black knife became an overwhelming black shadow, and the face rushed toward the opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa took a deep breath and his mouth was still black blood that was forced out by the Necromancer, but it was just this deep breath, and he looked like a sullen look. It seems to be a lot better. When Thamek’s overwhelming black knives came in, he breathed again and his face was rosy and many knives blew away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it was a loud bang that Asa was shocked and turned over from the broken stump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
