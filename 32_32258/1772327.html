			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple did not move, and Hilika did not move. The instruction that Asa just gave him in his mind was just to stop the Knights of the Temple from disturbing him, instead of taking the initiative. He looked at the knight in the eyes of the godless eyes like this. The pupils of Muran did not have the slightest murderousness, the imposing things, but the three temple knights had the illusion of a frog in front of the snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cave was caught in a strange silence, only the chewing sound of Rhodehart, who was eating the body of the Knights of the Temple, although the appearance was The burning of the fire element is dark, but the internal organs are not yet. Luo and Hart pulled the glorious armor and swallowed the viscera that was still hot out of his mouth. The dark skin inside his skin is falling off, and then the gray muscles below seem to get the heat from these foods, and they are creeping and growing slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the Knights of the Shrine are almost flying out of the blood, but they have not moved. Although their anger and excitement are no longer enough, they are the top and most sophisticated fighters, always knowing when and when they can't persuade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the gravity field has almost disappeared, and the magical light on Moriel’s body has finally dissipated, and a slap from the dragon’s mouth, the dragon’s head-sized dragon The eyes slowly open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa screamed and let go and looked at the Knights of the Temple in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the passage under the mountain bed is here, the cave of Morial, and the purpose of this Asa here is to put the sword of the Dark Star Handle it to Moriel and let the strongest of the continent protect it. It’s just that he didn’t come across the scene when he was attracted to the gravity that had been highlighted here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he doesn’t quite understand why Lancelot will lead the Knights of the Temple to appear in Nigen’s ability to go deep into the deepest to kill the dragon, but he is sure No one can let Moriel die anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at Asa and the two people who are not human, the face of the Knights of the Temple is chilling. The strength of these three people is indeed better than the ones who are both hurt and tired. The back of a pair of lantern-like yellow dragon eyes are also full of fatigue, no luster, but the endless killing has already made them sway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go." A big drink suddenly burst out of Lancelot's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the gravity field is active, Lancelot in the center has no way to move. But when the gravity field slowly eased, he still didn't move, even watching Asa's back to him did not move. Because he is very clear, as long as he moves, he must move meaningfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that when Asa just shattered the elements of fire, it’s a sigh of excitement, and this strange smell of strange smell. He already knew that he didn’t make any sense even if he attacked. This is no longer what they can do with the temperament and power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since you can’t attack, you can only escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But where to escape, the Knights of the Temple are a glimpse. The outside passage has been blown up by the Tauren Sacrifice with a magic scroll. The faint noise and excavation of the black elves can be heard. It is only from the slightest degree of the sound that the collapsed rock is definitely not short-lived. Clear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go the cave above." Lancelot drank. When he saw Asa fall, he knew that the three could never be lurking here beforehand, so he first looked up at the cave wall above and saw a passage. That is where the three of them fell. Now this is the only channel they can escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three Knights of the Temple only hesitated, and immediately flew all over the surrounding rock wall far more flexible than the apes and movements towards the top of the cave. The hole climbed and it was already in the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stunned. As soon as the mind was moving, Helikka immediately bowed his body and landed on the limbs like an animal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Booming, the rocky ground shattered under his hands and feet. The huge body actually rose like a dragonfly and rushed to the top of the shrine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as Helicia. But his speed is faster, and the white light is rising again on him. In the gravity field, he is constantly accumulating vindictiveness and strength. This time, all of them broke out, such as a white light arrow intercepting Helicika. He knew that the other party could not easily let them escape, and there must be criticism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot moved, Asa moved, and he also jumped, and the volley intercepted the sound of Lancelot’s broken air. Still as sharp as ever. But Lancelot saw that the knives that came from the volley were a glimpse, and some surprises, not warnings, were cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slamming sound, the long sword in Lancelot and the sword of Asa intersect, but the sound of this collision is not even as broken as the sword itself. Empty sounds. The two of them crossed in the air, and Lancelot's figure was still blocked by Silika without any hindrance. And Asa is stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; landing, Asa did not have the slightest damage, but was a little surprised and hesitant. The sword just did not pose any obstacle to Lancelot. He knows that this is his own mistake. This is not the difference between Lancelot's strength and his current level of mentality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he himself has no hostility and killing of Lancelot and the Knights of the Temple, but judging by reason, he also knows that it is best not to let them go away. The Knights of the Temple and Lancelot are certainly not bad people, but they can be regarded as enemies, at least opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reputation of Paladin Lancelot on the mainland is no longer necessary for anyone to suspicion and argument. And whether it is from the mouth of Ai's mother-in-law or her own short-term contact with him, Asa is really hard to make such a killing effect in such a person, so even if he shot, even if the strength and speed are still there, but still There is no murderous and imposing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; murderous and imposing, for the attack this is the soul, there is no murderous and murderous attack like a zombie without soul and flexibility, and he This knife is even hesitant. If it is another opponent, Asa's knife may be equally effective, but Lancelot is definitely not one of the ‘other’ people. Therefore, Asa’s knife did not have any effect on him. Lost murderousness and anger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change brought by the potential, the long sword is only a slight twist, the strength and speed of the knife are all dispelled, pushing and unloading The vindictiveness and momentum on the sword are still as steady as the mountains and the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa was surprised, he did not think that his absent-minded shot would actually be the result. The advantage has obviously not been obvious, so he will be lax, but the result of this slack is completely beyond his expectation and control. He now understands that although his strength has improved, he has skills and experience. There are too many gaps between these opponents and Lancelot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the battlefield, whether it is lax or misjudgment, as long as one has long been enough. His strength has been lost, the momentum has been exhausted, even if there is no endless murderousness at this time, it is useless, not to mention the opponent is still a top master who is superior in strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skill of the master is only half a foot away from his body. As long as the Paladin’s wrist is vibrating, he definitely has no chance. At this moment, his consciousness was even awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the sword that was still full of momentum just crossed his waist and did not cut him into two sections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps Lancelot’s goal is still Helicika, who believes that Asa’s life is no more important than his three men’s lives. Maybe for other reasons. A sword after Lancelot dismissed Asa’s knife was just passing him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of a bag full of air being smashed, the black 9 juice and other tiny pieces scattered all over the sky, and then the great body of the Greek card It fell heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot in midair was snoring, and there was a burst of bone breaks, and he immediately rushed upwards. Go, actually, one step earlier than the other three knights to the exit at the top of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika sat up and climbed, his right hand was broken, and a large hole in the abdomen was drilled, which made people very clear. Seeing the scene behind him. Even the spine was broken by a small half, so he stood up and looked a little shaken now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
