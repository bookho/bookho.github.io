			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin dragged the female knight’s hand and flew forward toward the front. The effect of the agitation force agility on his body and blood vessels roared and rushed to the body. Every minute of power is so full that the trees on both sides are flying backwards. From time to time, there are small branches and leaves that are burning on his face and burning a small blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boots on the feet seem to have a plus effect. Whether it’s a step or a jump, it’s a lot lighter if it’s the kind that doesn’t add magic and is permanent. The magic effect that is in effect, plus the man's saying that 'watering' is also attached to the advanced water magic. This is not an ordinary magical equipment. It is definitely a rare treasure that can be compared with the shining armor of the horsewoman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current situation, the role of the Glorious Battle Armor and this boot is far from perfect. That once a day, Tianzhiyou can't move this set of precious and magical armor. Now it's just a pile of iron sheets and the injury is not completely restored. Although the body is still assisted by white magic, the pace of the female knight is no faster than ordinary people. The degree of going to rely on Abbott to be able to keep up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, the degree in the two cities has already surpassed the horse. But the back screams and footsteps are getting closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first in the pursuit is the masked woman Jessica. Her slender figure is silently leaping in the woods, blocking the trees like a A combination of shadows and civet cats. If I don't care that I am not the opponent of the Abin and the Cavaliers, I have to wait for the next few companions. She may have already caught up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second person is the mysterious man who chased him all the way and cursed him with a two-handed sword and turned into a Welsh's Druid. Druid's slowest response was to wait for the first few people to run out of a distance before reacting and taking out the wolf's head on his head. But after turning into a werewolf, he quickly rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, Hilica, who is empty, is undoubtedly unable to bring people to chase people. Although the tall figure of the bear has agility and degree that is completely disproportionate to the volume, it is only because his body is too big. Many people in front can be transported to the place where he can go, but he can only go around or simply Hit the trees in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to mention the two of Axis and the old man. Even the man’s voice didn’t wake up the two magicians who had completely died. Originally, Hilton wanted to let the two people add to the surgery, but thought that the spirit of half-sleeping and half-awake might not even move the mantra and waste time in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it seems that you don't have to worry about this. The white magic light that scatters from the prey is the perfect road sign in the night without worrying about losing the target. And the chaser can see that the two figures are getting closer and closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you do with the boss, will the kid save the scorpion?" Hilton asked behind the man. Unconsciously, he seems to have identified the status of this man. For people, the hardest heart and the most sinister nature of the fist is the boss. Everything that the man showed has already convinced Hilton. But for this new confession, how can the boss save the little hair and he feels that he can't imagine it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, I’ve got the white magic of the kid for a moment." I can’t see the expression on the man’s face in the middle of the run, but the anger in the tone is Can feel it. "I can't spare him if I catch this kid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure that the front is the Piton River. They can't run." Hilton vomited. saliva. "Fuck me, this little man is also a good impression on him. I know that it is actually a church undercover. Fuck. Anderson will seize the undercover of this church and you must kill him. He is your enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werewolf Druid did not speak. There is no expression on his face. I don’t know if he doesn’t want to talk or becomes a werewolf can’t talk. He only runs silently behind the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘咔嚓’‘Touch’ only listened to the sound and knew that the next Helix had broken two trees and followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...or throw the armor...throw it." Flying to the ground, Abin, it’s hard to finish this sentence and the chest and abdomen have begun to breathe. And began to pain. Both feet have also started to be sour. It’s hard to drag the female knight in armor to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not to say... don't... there is a chance in the future... you can grab it back again." Abin's forehead was immediately rushed out by a small branch of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. The preciousness of the Glorious Battlegear is not only the armor itself. It is the blessing and blessing of the newcomers of the Pope...is every Knight of the Temple Honor and conviction all. Even...just temporary...can't abandon." The knight finally began to gasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice behind the chaser is getting closer and closer and can even hear the man’s curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't throw it away...we will die." Abin said with a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights’ teeth bite and say: “Even if you die, you cannot give up honor and faith in the Lord.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You..." Abin flew in the middle of a raised root of the foot and smashed a few squats and almost fell and managed to stand still. Even in this moonlight, you can see that his face is flushed. I don’t know if it’s tired or because I didn’t breathe in one breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fuck you two bastards can't run. You can live with your uncle to give you a good time..." Hilton's voice rang in the back than those old-fashioned knight novels. Sentences are more old-fashioned than nonsense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight was chasing and rushing to break Abbott’s hand and stood still. Abin also stood still and looked back at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will stop them here. Walk by yourself. You can save me. I am very glad that the Lord in heaven will know your kindness and courage." "The female knight turned her head and faced the clear outlines of the faces of the chasing soldiers. The true men's perseverance voice was also firm and calm. "I can't give up my glory and faith. I believe in me." The choice I have to face in the face of hardships and hardships is a test that God has given me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nearest Jessica stopped and waited for the next few people . The chasing soldiers who came together to gather together could not help but slow down and stopped at the distance of tens of meters in front of the two. They know very well that the two men are no longer able to run. I want to see what else these two people have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are crazy. Run." Abin came over and pulled the hand of the horsewoman. He can see the light in the eyes of the man. It is not useful or cold can be described simply. Only he can understand the meaning implied in the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Ge’Silika’s huge muscle-built body with a foot on a tree appeared in the eyes of everyone. The light that is scattered in his eyes than the animal and the animal can understand the meaning of the land. Or you don't have to be a human being, as long as it is an animal, you can perceive the violent killing of the body that is about to explode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go yourself." The knight opened the hand of Abin. "I said that you want to stay here. I will help you with my honor..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'啪' Abin’s ear slaps loudly and incomparably The face of the horsewoman. The slap in the face was not only very loud but also powerful. The face of the female knight was swollen and swollen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although everyone stunned, the most embarrassing thing is the horsewoman. The burning pain in his face was also faintly blank. I don’t know if it was being beaten or because I couldn’t understand what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other people’s pace has slowed down. But Hilika didn't stop him from striding toward the two like a bear. He has no curiosity and an elegant interest in playing with cats. Even if there is a pastime that catches the prey and tears the hands and feet to hear the wail and ask for mercy and watch the blood and the bones protruding outside the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin did not pay attention to the horsewoman. There is no such thing as the female knight is said to have fled alone to face these or near or far pursuits. He suddenly raised his hands and mourned the mantra: "The Lord of heaven please give me the glory of retreat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone. In the first time, including the Greek card, the posture was prepared. But it seems that nothing happened to the Abbin’s hands and the hands were empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fuck. What kind of tricks to play and come over and surrender." Hilton danced with the sword and went to the two. Of course, the first thing to do is that Helicia has at least doubled the murderous light in his eyes because of the illusion of this opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can spare everyone's curse from the sinister curse. The strongest part of the white light is shot into their eyes. Exclamations and screams invariably followed their blinking and blinking movements. The voice of the woman Jessica emerged from her mouth, especially as if she was not illuminated, but was dug out with a knife.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'呛'. Although the screams came one after another, the four people also heard the sound of a sword pulling out from the position of Abin, everyone was pulling out and rushing back. The well-prepared heating was prepared to guard against the blind attack. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two voices are then the sound of the trees falling down and colliding with each other. Several people, including Hilika, did not dare to tamper with the warning that they might fall on their heads at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is no such attack. After waiting for a dozen seconds, the eyes gradually recovered, and the talents could not see the two white figures. When the two trees stood up and the two trees were stopped by the waist, they slammed the footsteps of the two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fuck. Actually so sly. Quickly chase ***." Hilton was violently thundered because he was twice played. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the bastard of this trick. "It’s still more violent as if it were the man<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilton I stopped on the ground for a while and then pointed to one direction and said, "This is the side. Everyone can rest assured that I heard the sound of the river. They can't run."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a blank in the head of the horsewoman. The effect of the slap in the face has continued. She is only mechanically swayed by the hand and feels that the scenery on both sides is flying away. She only woke up when she saw a river in front. This wide river gracefully turned in front of them. The 'several' shape surrounded them. The hand that pulled her was finally released. Abin stopped and stepped down to breathe on the river beach. His physical strength has already reached the limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few people who followed were finally rushed up to see the two men who had entered the dead end of the prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight is amazed that she knows that even if she is running into the water, this armor is a fatal burden. At this time, the monk who took a break and suddenly took a break. She hugged her and shouted: "Don't hold me tight." Then he rushed toward the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people including the female knight stayed. But let them stay in the back of the Abin's feet, like stepping on the sparkling river like stepping on the ground, stepping out a round ripple and rushing toward the shore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it a water transfer? This kid has such a scroll." Hilton exclaimed. He can be sure that this is definitely the effect of the magic scroll. Otherwise, a young man with such martial arts will use white magic and use such high water magic. Then he should be chasing himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a few breaths of time, the Abin has already rushed to the other side and dropped the female knight and immediately fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight stood up and looked around and couldn’t believe it, so she really escaped. After returning to God, she quickly squatted and looked at the young man who saved himself. He was just too tired to faint. It is not a problem for the horsewoman to use him for a recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, it’s really going to let these two escape." Hilton was anxious to jump. The river is nearly 100 meters wide. Although the people here can also swim in the past, when the tour is over, the female knight is enough to carry the Abin to escape without a trace. He quickly turned to Druid. "Can you turn into a fish? Isn't something like a turtle carrying us in the past?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The werewolf gave him a roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of a similar werewolf in the throat of Helica. He looked at the two unreachable figures on the opposite side. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The opposite person who uses the evil weapon, listen to the name of the Lord, do you dare to tell me the name of your name?" The river came from the other side. "I swear by the honor of the knight and the name of God that I will wash away my shame with your blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
