			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When seeing Abin’s appearance of Talis, Asa had vaguely knew what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who is rash, especially a sense of justice, can never be a companion to Tami in the Cavaliers, and it will get in the way. It is not surprising that Talis is such a person that the Tamik Knights are not allowed to be in the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Abin, this kid is alive and well, and his mind is also very good. It is not impossible to be able to mix with the Thamik Knight. But the key is that he knows that Abin will definitely give himself a chance to save Talis in this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time will not be him, only the Tamik Knight. /?u=109443<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, the voice of the Knights of Tamik fell, and when the knife was lifted, the sword of Abin was stabbed and pulled. Talis retired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an opportunity, so Asa immediately moved. If he wants to highlight the trap, he must ride the Tamek Knight and be confused by accident. This opportunity. So he jumped up with all his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he just found himself wrong when he jumped again. This is not an opportunity he expected, but an opportunity that the other party deliberately gave him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trap is not just a calculation of him, but also a referee. Almost at the same time as Yabin shot, the one behind him stood with a sword of Talis, and they slammed them on their backs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa instantly throws a knife and throws it at the Templar. The knife is attached with vindictiveness so that the knife does not penetrate, but directly hits the Templar. . But even so, the sword was cut on Abin. At the same time, the knife of the Tamik Knight flashed, and Abin’s arm flew up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s heart sinks, he knows he may have fallen into the trap of the other party. At least his knife has to be thrown out. And his heart is already chaotic, and he knows that his actions have long been in the calculations of the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body that swept through the air hit a tiny silky silk thread in the air, then the lightning and fireballs that were simultaneously emitted in three or four different directions took him Hard to fall to the ground. At the moment of landing, the magical fluctuations surrounding the volcanic eruption made him understand himself and touched other magic traps, so he only rushed and hardened. /?u=109443<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now knows that there are nineteen magical magic traps hidden in this blood oil, because these traps are all strange. The way they are connected in series, he just touched one when landing. The other eighteen also broke out at the same time, and then each of them was vented to him from different angles in different ways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame that melts the steel almost turns around and looks for any hole in the hole to turn the body into coke, and change it with magic. The earth thorns continually hit the body, smashing in the collision of the thorns and vindictiveness similar to the rock. Lightning also madly jumped on the surface of the grudge. /?u=109443<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wilder than these magical elements is the vindictiveness in the body, the power of these lives is desperately going out, he almost feels Self and flesh and vitality are also erupting toward the outside of the body with vindictiveness. This is really desperate, because if you don't fight, you will have no life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should be able to advance other people into the waves of the sea of ​​rags, hard rushing, rushing the flames and smashing the soil to force the electric shock. In the magical ocean, a hard road hits a road. /?u=109443<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he finally rushed out, his body vindictively extinguished, and the magical explosion behind him became a coast that was already exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be able to hard out the encirclement of this magic trap. Asa is sure that his power in that few moments can be compared with Gru. No matter what the situation is now. A sense of pride and satisfaction can not help but take a look at my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you can only take a moment. At the moment he rushed out, the black fangs had been greeted with a kind of warmth and enthusiasm. /?u=109443<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have reached a minimum moment, and this knife is coming at this time. The knife is as fast as electricity, violent as a thunder, and the call from the knife<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whistling and dark fluctuations are completely united with the knife, like a hundred heads hungry for hundreds of years. The evil spirits condense into a swarm of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this knife can be faster, more fierce and more unstoppable, but the Tamik Knight did not think that Abin actually will be more hands-on than him, and <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as a knife to him. Just let it go a little, stabbing him with a sword. Although this is not a serious injury, it also affected his body movements, so that he could not gather all the spirit and strength to find out the original lore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this seems to be enough. /?u=109443<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not completely hit the Tamik Knight, Asa is now there is no energy to concentrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A green fireball emerged from Asa’s palm and flew towards the Tamek Knight. But this is the fireball that just touched the knife blade and the madness of the madness immediately dissipated silently and was swallowed up. This piece of black, which is mixed with the magic of the dead spirit, is not an illusion, but can really be smashed, swallowed, and destroyed everything in front of it. /?u=109443<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa only flies with all the power. The hands are hard to pick up the call sign and come to a sea-like soul and ghost. He also saw that this knife was never an empty hand, but the knife was no longer there, the vindictiveness was completely consumed, and the instant magic was useless. He only had these hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no connection, but if you can't get it, you will only die, and you will have no room for death. The smell of this long-lost death made him scream every nerve. I have been embarrassed for a long time. Meditation is fully open, and all consciousness shrinks into a point in the mind. The whole world is empty except for the knife in front of it. /?u=109443<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world is empty, so he can see what he wants to see. /?u=109443<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of this knife brings out the strength of the force to bring out the momentum and bring out the change and bring out the inevitable Angle, all the factors have been wrapped in a strong murderous one. All the movements of the Tamik Knight who stabbed the knife could also be seen clearly. He even tweeted from the turm of the knife to hear the trembling of the muscles of the Tamik Knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s hands are closed, and both palms have been sandwiched between them. No matter how big the murderous and killings inspired by this knife, this is only a knife. /?u=109443<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s not caught in it, just like the bread is blocked on the axe’s trajectory. Resist the axe. Asa can clearly feel that the skin of his own hands under the violent knife is like a piece of bread soaked in water, and it will smash, splash and splash. It’s not just the damage on the surface. The curse of the Necromancer that has been integrated with the sword is rushing into the body. The body on the palm is dead for a moment, withering, if it’s his own necrotic magic. And the white magic is strong enough to resist, but this curse is enough to make him die a hundred times. /?u=109443<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One enter, one retreat, the two men’s physiques have been connected together with a shadow of darkness and murderous flies Grab it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This retreat is already retreat, Asa’s figure is completely covered by this knife, branches, leaves, grass on the ground are The overflowing knives and cursing powers flew up and turned into gray and gray ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person is retreating, but the knife is still moving forward, but it has already become a spurt because of this advancement and retreat. The slight resistance on the palm is completely insignificant. With a bang, the knife slammed into the body without any hindrance. Muscles, ribs, and internal organs are no different from the paper paste under the power and lethality of this knife. Without real contact, the body has become a broken powder and rushed out from the other side of the body. In, the shoulders came out, and a fist-sized hole was worn from Asa's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom. A large tree behind Asa directly shattered, and the sawdust was flying like a heavy rain made of wood, and then the second one on the same line was also blocked for two. The knife and the magical force that penetrated from his body completely dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
