			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, the legendary let it continue to go to the legend, I have not been interested in the legend." The Pope smiled, with white light The finger twitched and the ring at the end of the hilt slipped down. The darkness of the sky on the hilt was just rushing out, and the hilt had been returned to the sun in the pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations," said Bishop Hamm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations to me?" The Pope looked at the bishop with interest. “Congratulations, I got this hot potato?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No, congratulations, you have not lost your calmness and reason under the temptation of this hilt, no loss. Your own heart. Your heart has at least exceeded the previous Pope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have always been interested in something that is actually something." The Pope brought the ring. I looked at my own hand and smiled slightly and nodded. It’s true that everyone listens to it, and the heart is again the same in the high city, especially when these words are good. "Why, because of Ham, are you not interested in this thing? As a member of Deya Valley, can you not be tempted to face this artifact?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Not at all tempted." Because Bishop Hamm smiled. "Every Necromancer can feel the horror contained in this guiding sword from the soul when accepting the brand of the Dark Star. So there is no one except those who are stunned by desires and other things. People are really interested in the legendary king of the dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope nodded: "This is also good. This is purely a bait, please that Come here. To be honest, I really want to meet him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, when Bishop Inham returned to Erasia, only the Pope and When Lancelot was. Lancelot asked at this time: "Your Majesty, I think this person is still killing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he said this, his face There is no such thing as murderousness and embarrassment. It seems to be a pertinent suggestion to a friend. It is still honest, steady, and bright, and the code name of the Paladin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope did not answer directly, just said: "Well, you almost started it, rarely seeing when you have taken the initiative to show hostility to a person." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the moment of entering, the distance between Lancelot and Inham Bishop, as well as the lock on his momentum and attention, They are all in a state where they can be shot at any time and they are almost ready to be shot. Under such distance, no mage can win the slightest vitality from the top swordsman like him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot said in a deep voice: "Even if it is not what he arranged, now Nigan’s business is over, the situation is clear, I think and his Compared with his use, he is much more dangerous. This kind of person is still killing. In fact, I also thought that His Majesty would definitely agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope A touch: "Well. What do you think is the most dangerous place for him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot said: "The most dangerous place for him is It seems that he does not feel his danger at all. No matter where he looks, it seems that he really does not need anything, no ambition. It is really useful. But I always feel that he is very dangerous."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Feeling..." The Pope narrowed his eyes and seemed to be fully aware of the feeling of 'feeling' in Lancelot's words, then nodded. "Maybe it is... but it still can't kill him now... Once again, Ou Fu is on the move, and Erasia must be driven by him. His relationship with Queen Catherine is the best bridge for us to control Elazia. Showing absolute cooperation and obedience to me, that's what I want. And his eagle eye's role in the battle is something that no one else can replace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Everything is determined by His Majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And now I am neither worried about him nor worrying about Oufu, but worry about this." The finger has been placed on the table pocket. "This bait is very big, very good. But it seems that the temptation is overdone. I am worried that I will not only bring the kid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ...Sandru and Agrirenal? Are there other necromancers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
