			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another ten days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumors about the orc city-state in the depths of the wild land have become more and more widespread and more and more popular. Some people say that they saw the orc who was dressed like a Guardian of the King and also talked to him. There are also businessmen returning from the west saying that people in the West have long been to the orc city-state to do the deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how rumored the reality is, it is getting better. The robbery of the big-eared monsters has disappeared. First, because Brakada’s annihilation of a big ear camp has played a great deterrent role. Another reason is that the army in the south is about to open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not good news for the thieves in the city. During this time, they got a lot of oil and water from the chaos caused by the robbery. But seeing this good day is gone forever. Some people have already begun to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is still a group of thieves who stay here and they are staying here to prepare for the big money. This is a group of gangsters who are guilty of murder and nowhere to go. The gang of the elite wicked in the gangsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group is now holding a meeting in the room of one of the largest hotels in town. The content of the meeting was about going to the orc's city-state to buy the stolen goods and accepting a new accomplices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this extraordinary period, there are still new people joining this. Many members who are undoubtedly very out of date have expressed their opposition. A few days ago, two members were taken to prison by the city's guards, but they returned a few days later and brought a young man. It turned out that the young man was a prisoner in the same cell with them. With a high skill, he overturned the jailer and escaped and handed out all the prisoners. Then he told the two members that he wanted to go to the legendary orc city-state to steal the stolen goods and ask if they wanted to partner with themselves. Two people saw him as a fellow man and admired his high skill and he introduced him into this thief gang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oldest thief named Fo Duo, who is the leader of the conference, is also the leader of this thief gang. This is a frustration of more than 50 faces of nearly 60-year-old man's face. Not only does it have no aging taste, but it is also a kind of old-fashioned, slick and vigorously scattered old age spots. It is a testimony of experience and experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what career you want to do, you must be mindful. When the old thieves knew about the orc city-state, they saw that the big-eared monsters began to rob and immediately made plans to steal from the stolen goods. So he and the big-eared geeks contacted and then gathered together a group of people who also took their heads to eat together to do this big sale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is mixed with the thieves, although there are still many people who are dissatisfied with him but he has just become a member of this gang. Things are much smoother than expected. In a few days, he can reach the orc's city-state. Not only can he get the book back, but he can also see the specific situation of the city-state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now ask everyone for your opinion." The old thief said his plan and looked around to his accomplices. Aside from his career, this is an old man who knows how to live. Even if he really knows that the most comprehensive planners do not forget to ask for opinions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No opinion." "Take what you said." "With the money in the past, you can use it." Although there are still a few doubts, Most agree with the plans of the old thieves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old thief finally made a decision: "There is a decision in the morning after three days. Everyone should remember if the news falls in the ears of those who are in the office." That is, there must be an army to chase after us for treason. So I remind you once again that you can never reveal any news." He looked around and looked at Asa. He didn't trust the new person very much. If the two members did not bring him directly, he would never allow this person to join. This is a very dangerous plan. He didn't want to make any mistakes a few days before he killed a gang who was only personally intimate with the city's escort chief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tototo has a very rhythmic knock on the door. Everyone in the room stood up and figured out the room in the weapon. It was quiet and there was only a murderous breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s three times that it’s very rhythmic and not too heavy to knock on the door as if it’s asking for the owner’s consent. This is by no means a ritual in the hotel. Asa suddenly has a strange feeling. It is so polite to knock on the door. He seems to have heard it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for someone. Open the door." It was a female voice that was as crisp as a pear. The old thief turned and looked at Asa. This is the room that Asa is in the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound seems to have been heard but I can’t remember it. Asa shook her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old thief made a gesture of pulling in and closing the door to the thief at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief slammed open the door and grabbed it. But then it wasn't that he pulled someone in but was pulled out. It wasn't just pulling out. It seemed to be directly thrown down by the homeopathic screams that fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost everyone rushed toward the door. But a slender sword sneaked in through the door and a few spurs immediately stopped the front man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do I do to find someone." The repeater repeated his intentions and actually came in. It’s just a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a relatively small person holding a very thin sword in his hand and thin and long. But no one dares to underestimate the dangerous edge of the weapon. It shows that the wound caused by the ** can not be stitched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa has seen such a sword. He immediately looked at the face of the swordman and could not help but wonder: "How is it? What are you doing here? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course it is looking for you." The eyes of the coming person smashed into a tiny gap to show the smile. This smile once made him almost lost his life in the lizard swamp and now this situation is not much better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the world tree leaf seems to be surprisingly good. She has already been judged when she was lying on the bed more than a month ago. It was restored to her spirited look in the lizard swamp. Even the dress was no different from the one. The adventurer's costume was draped in a blanket carrying a large backpack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, it was originally a friend of Asa’s friend, please come in." The old thief turned to look at Asa and let a road make a gesture of advancing. Actually it is still a very aristocratic action. But when Ozawa walked to Asa's side, he seemed to be inadvertently turning around and standing on the side of the door. The knife was not visible behind him but he must still be in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa feels that her head is big and she looks at her. She even smiled and said, "The air in this room is so boring. Why are you so many people?" Open the window."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you open it, if you have bloody smell, you won’t smoke the dead." The old thief who kept the door smirked at his face. The old age spots also shook. The thieves consciously changed their position and placed Asa around the arms of many of them without letting go. And the two members who recommended Asa came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young man, I don't have any opinion about you. I absolutely believe in you." The old thief's voice was sincere. "But now everyone is walking on the edge of the razor. You have to explain it to everyone. How do you have such a very noble aristocratic friend?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dim light in the room shook all the faces on the faint hostility and alertness. These people's eyes are not vegetarian. It can be seen that the temperament of the small 懿 懿 投 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝 绝And how can such a noble woman come to find a thief from a foreign country? The original of them must be deeply savvy, as long as there is a trace of uncoordinated danger, they will touch their allergic policing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Asa has the confidence to retreat, but this time the hard work of this month is in vain for the book and I don’t know when to get it back. . If you let other people take over the stolen goods, it will be a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that you are killing talents outside and we have never been asked. I will tell you about your deeds now. You are Where are the people doing things. The friends here are from all over the place and should know how to tell the truth." The old thief wants Asa to show his own feet. He is now sure that Asa is a sneak peek. Probably a subordinate of a noble family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa shook his head and said, "I am afraid that you will mention my head to receive the reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa faintly said: "Two months ago, I killed the imperial minister and the local officials there in Airy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lie is 90% The truth and the ingredients of the lie are not surprising. It’s easier to believe that you are overwhelmed by others. This is what Mr. Porougan told him when he was about to sneak into the gang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the thieves’ commotions have long been shocked by the whole country. The investigative forces dispatched by Wang Duo almost turned over the city of Airy and heard that only a young man was wanted. This is the rare reward of the big criminals in Wangdu in recent years. It has already broken through 100 gold coins. This overnight murderer has long been a legend in the mouth of thieves. They really can't think of the big man in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really? But I heard that there were more than a dozen cavalry missing at the time. It wouldn’t be what you did?" The old thief clearly did not believe the eyes. Suddenly stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two thieves who suddenly reached out to pull the neck of Asa and Otaru and the other hand had already pulled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa head did not return an elbow and was hit by the thief’s heart behind the thief, and he slammed it without a click. The other hand had to deal with another thief, but he saw that the thief’s wrist was very skillful and twisted him to the ground. This is the first time Asa saw her shot is actually very clean and clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the thieves are violent and the atmosphere has reached a critical point and will be out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa took out something from her arms and threw it at the old thief. This is what Rodhart returned to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old thief took over and looked at the light carefully. This is a seal carved out of the whole agate. The pattern is clearly engraved with the official title and the emperor's gift. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed a seal given by the emperor to the imperial minister. The royal imperial work is not an ordinary thief that ordinary craftsmen can imitate. Have confidence. No one is willing to fake this kind of thing with an agate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he also heard that the wanted young man really did it because he took the seal of the imperial minister and cheated a sum of money to become this shocking case. The only clue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is" the old thief coughed a wrinkle on his face and twisted it all. Look at his face. Other thieves have understood that the eyes of a little alert have turned into awe and surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not more than a dozen cavalry are more than fifty cavalry. I have all slaughtered." Asa still said faintly with his thief identity. Naturally, there is an extraordinary momentum. "If you can join us, you can also perform here. I just don't think it's necessary. I just come to find a partner to make a fortune." Asa's eyes swept through all the thieves in the house. It is also convenient to deal with these people who have their heads to eat. Just like the same kind of animals rely on the smell to distinguish the strengths and weaknesses, as long as the murderous ones come out, everyone’s eyes in the blood of the knife and the shadows will immediately know each other’s eyes. weight. The beastly atmosphere that he cultivated in the wild in the wild, and after many times of tempering through the gates of the gates, can make this ordinary criminal chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small scorpion actually fought a few times with the atmosphere of the sword. Although she has no momentum, she still has it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old thief nodded. He also saw that the young man’s seal in front of him gave Asa a look at Xiaoyan and asked, "That she is"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a daughter of the Duke, my lover." Asa introduced it to everyone. "Please forgive me for not being able to tell her father's name. She is carrying the whole family out and running away with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All thieves are again A commotion, but such an incredible thing added to the head of such a powerful person can only be regarded as a versatile person who can no longer cause any suspicion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the twilight, the thieves were finally dealt with in the room and only Asa and Otaru were left. After confirming that no one had eavesdropped, Asa took a sigh of relief and looked at Xiaoyan and asked: "Do you know that you almost killed me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I don't know, but I know that if you go to the acting or lie to the girl, you will be very promising. Big lover." Xiao Yan looked at him like a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
