			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade of the blade in the neck of the hand violently tightened and twitched out and the small volume of disproportionate tremor seems to be all the life contained in it . As the warm, odorous liquid gradually dripped, the tremor between the middle finger gradually subsided and finally dissipated. Asa tried to squeeze the squirrels and did not care that the stomach contents were squeezed together. Until the last drop of body fluid slowly dripped Asa to drop the twisted and deformed mountain mouse to stick out the tongue and put the bloody mouth in the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell of blood transpires from the stomach. The throat makes a low-pitched screaming sullen, long and deep, not like an organ but a fold from the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice, he remembers when he was three years old, he hid in the tree and saw several hunters in the village rounding up a wounded wolf. He was trembled by the wolf's low screams, not fear, but felt that the deepest string in the soul resonated with it. Since then, he has been obsessed with learning the language of animals for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now understands that the voice is meaningless, but the screaming of life before the threat of death is a strong desire for survival and a near-madness of the animal nature in the heart. put. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days of rude blood and extreme tension and physical strength. The torment of death behind his tail and his strong desire for survival have turned him into an almost wild beast. But fortunately, reason is still leading all actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is well aware of the gap in her ability with the stalker. He remembered very clearly how the heads of the two infantry of the three teams were beaten like watermelons in one face. The only thing that can be relied upon now is the insight into the other's intent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stalker did not fully pursue him. This is not to chase down the stalker and does not want to catch up with him as soon as possible and then risk the injury and bite each other in a desperate beast. This is when hunting has been chasing prey so that the prey will gradually weaken in fear and death. When there is a 12-point grasp, he will come over and kill him as a mouse to cut him off his head. No matter whether it is a physical factor or a skill that survives in this swamp jungle, he can't get rid of hunting. It is very clear that both of them are chasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these three days, Asa pretends to be the stalker who wants to see the escape. Physical fitness also drops as fast as a real escape. If you can't make a fire, you won't have enough food. You can eat raw meat in a lizard swamp. Any animal's meat is dead. For the human body, the parasite inside is fat enough. Instead, it can only find some non-toxic insects to eat raw. Although the animal's blood is safe, it can be slightly supplemented but not enough to cope with the sweat and physical strength lost by a large amount of exercise. The lack of salt and food has almost reached the limit of tolerance. The true illusion of the three days must be terminated with an action that cannot be mistaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very good luck quickly found three non-toxic worms from the surrounding grass and shrubs. The size of the finger is full of vitality and tumbling around the hand. Pinching your head with your fingers and slowly pulling down the green stool is squeezed out. Excessive force can not over-extrude the insect body so that the nutritious juice splash and try to discharge the potentially toxic feces. This is a very sophisticated craft. After a few days of using Asa has been very skilled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tender flesh quickly becomes a thick, mushy, bitter, bitter taste between the teeth, as the swampy air sticks to the skin. Rotating on the taste buds. Asa carefully uses the tongue to grind the tongue and carefully search the meat paste for large pieces of meat that have not been missed to ensure that all the worms can be turned into the smallest possible unit for easy digestion. Every drop of nutrition is precious and hope for the next power to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use a knife to dig a pit about one foot on the ground to bury the body of the mountain rat. Every time he kills an animal in these three days, he will not bury his body with valuable physical strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knife was carefully checked on the back and I flattened the protrusions of each garment as carefully as the cautionary sentiment stepped on the narrow gangster and stepped cautiously. The mound of the mountain rat was buried and slowly squatted down like a hugely deformed worm slowly moving to the side of the beach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He focused all his attention on this ugly movement, carefully controlling every muscle on the body and letting the body stick as far as possible on the ground. Don't leave any visible marks on the soft mud. The loss of control and inconsistency of any one action will make the three-day mentality completely in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few places on the body that are slightly ruined by water. Asa did not pay attention to sucking the blood. They would loosen their mouths and reluctantly let the suction cups remain in the skin to cause infection. The most important thing is to sneak as far as possible before the next breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mind, I revisited every detail I just made. Without a flaw, the great joy of being born will come to life. The only problem now is the squirrel's body. It must rot to a sufficient extent before the stalker arrives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only need a rotten luck now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa squatting on the mud deposited on the decayed material like a sauropod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rare sun in the afternoon lizard swamp reveals a face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun was cut by the branches and fell into pieces. The damp ground turns the sun's body into a layer of curtains that circulate between the leaves and the ground of the tree. In this sweltering and humid curtain, all the swamps are fast-lived and fast-flying, and the deaths that fly for other lives are all business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stalker quietly watched a large group of rotten lizards smashing the body of a mountain rat. He hates the mucoid smell of these ugly scavengers, which is too strong for his sensitive sense of smell. A large lizard triumphantly grabbed the body and turned to escape. Others immediately swarmed and disappeared in the forest leaving only a trail of pits and footprints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For humans, this prey is quite good and the agility is very good. The stalker is very interested and has considerable confidence to kill him in a positive battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but only a fair grasp is not enough. This is not a battlefield, but hunting is gradually taking into account with considerable certainty. Since yesterday, the footprint has begun to gradually become vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stalker now feels that he has enough confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is also a strange prey. Although it is indeed being chased by the footprints, it does not show the messiness and panic that should be pursued by the pursuit of prey. The incompetent pace reveals a strange firmness that is not a glimpse of escape but something else to hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cover-ups in these three days have done a good job, but they have always made a stupid mistake - to bury the dead animal body. This is perfectly suited to the fact that the anti-lizard will find the rotten smell to dig up and eat. The stalker can almost follow the stench of a large group of lizards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unspeakable mentality Stupid mistakes There seems to be a connection between the two. This feeling makes the stalker feel a bit strange. But it's just that it's just strange and it's no surprise that after catching up and killing the head. No animal can get rid of its own tracking in this swamp jungle. This point stalker has absolute confidence. absolute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the stalker immediately surprised that all the traces only came here and did not extend in any direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air only leaves the strong smell of the swamp lizard. The stalker leaned down and scrutinized any clues on the ground. Although the lizard crawls and competes for food to make a mess around the ground, but for the strong observation and experience of the stalker, the traces of this prey are still visible. It takes a while to explore all the traces around. Chu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some vain but not flustered steps did not step on their footprints. The traces of returning to the road were only a few turns in the surrounding shrubs, about looking for food. The stalker can even judge that the first food he found was probably the worm from the two horns. The front half of the two footprints there is slightly deeper and shows the center of gravity of the bending action. But nothing else has happened. The footprints only came to an abrupt stop before the pit where the body was buried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is completely out of the experience of the stalker's tribe for many years. The physical stalkers who are escaping from escaping are only relying on their own minds to connect with other things that hope to draw experience from them. But the mind lacking logical thinking ability is difficult to accomplish this task. An unstoppable anger frantically occupies all his thoughts when he feels that he is trapped in a strange trap step by step as the fugitive expects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
