			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I havenâ€™t seen such a big scene for a long time." Sandro struggled to find a foothold in the corpse and walked step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the valley between the two hills. The dense body filled with almost every bit of ground blood in the valley seemed to condense the air in the valley into a huge solid. The breathing inside could not be smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the bodies of the imperial soldiers who apparently died from the traces on the body but there are no traces of other enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Bishop Rooney is hard to see the candle-like scorpion glance at the body and silently follow behind Sandro. He wore a very ordinary ordinary monk robes that looked like an ordinary old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a prominent rock in the middle of the valley with a man in a red robe posing. He saw both Sandru and Bishop Ronis coming up and stood up and greeted forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The spirit of seeing the two teachers for more than 20 years is still such a healthy student. I really feel gratified." Red robe to Sandru and Luo The Bishop of Nice succumbed to a ceremony. "Because I didn't expect the troops to travel so fast, there was some deviation in the position of the magical array, so it would be a shame for the two teachers to work hard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Are these people killed?" Bishop Ronis stared at the red robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The red robes answered with respect and respect. "They were assigned to the Orc Castle in the north to scout and harass. Anyway, it is also a bad road to die here and prevent them from being ravaged. I took their captain and let him bring the team in and then Applying illusion here makes them kill each other. It is much better to die in the hands of oneself than the beasts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru looks at the red The robe man blinded his face and asked, "What's wrong with your face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red robe sticks out the claws like a dry hand on his face The robes were taken down to reveal half of the ordinary face. His mouth was squatting, no muscles, and the skin was exposed to the gray bones of the toilet wall and the bones attached to the dead grass. He used that half of his face to reveal half a bitter smile: "Student cares for the bad guys has damaged the mask that Mr. Sander specially made for me. But the teacher who hurts this mask is also the teacher of Sandru, should I be my younger brother? "This is the scar left in the whispering of Mori and Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru thought about shaking his head and said, "Not my student." At least Asa never called his teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red robe said: "But I saw him wearing the gown of the Ghost King that you took away and the part he was exposed to was burned by my magic. No injury This is the protection of the Ghost King's Gown that only the people who have practiced the real meditation can completely sing. The real meditation that you took away more than 20 years ago is not how your students can practice it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Ronis turned to look at Sandro and saw that Sandro did not see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is not your student, is your son?" asked the red robe. "Not long ago, the student was injured when he was not allowed to do so. He hoped that the teacher would not be surprised."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shandro shook his head and said, "No, he is my student." He also said that he could not admit it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's a very energetic young man. It's no wonder that the teacher can also favor it. Although I hurt him, he should fall into the sunwell and it will be fine." Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Rooney frowned and said: "You have tried every means to send two delivery reels to us. Would you like us to talk to you about these nonsense? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not. The two teachers ask you to look over there." He reached out and pointed to the magical array in the center of the rock rock he was sitting on. Zhang Cui green leaves, the atmosphere of the corpse of the valley can not hide the leaves are dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to use the power of two teachers to complete an unprecedented magical ritual." The voice of the red robe has changed, but it is still hoarse but excitement. "Using the power of the leaves of the world tree as the core to shape a magical life body with the body here. This will be the most powerful creature in the past and the present. The completely different magical power of the teacher and me can surround the leaves of the world tree. The combination of vitality and cycle is endless. Especially with the power of the leaves of the world tree, you can use the legendary white magic resurrection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This magical ritual can even be farther away from the power of the ancient gods. This will be the highest state of magic. The testimony of the human challenge creator is the greatest art. This great initiative will be the strongest magic of our three big 6 The teacher came to perform." The voice of the red robe became more hoarse and strange because of the excitement. Sandro seems to have been eclipsed by his emotionally infected eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think I will promise?" Bishop Ronis's voice was as cold as a basin of ice water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to ask the teacher to honor the promise of twenty-three years ago. Help me a favor"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I only remember that a student named Vedina was promised that I would try my best to help her achieve a wish. Unfortunately, she was no longer there." The voice of Bishop Ronis was a bit strange because of memories and emotions. Turned into a resolute resentment. "But I never remember talking about a monster like a lich." He turned his head and walked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the teacher endure to see countless civilians dying in countless towns and villages destroyed?" The red robe shouted in a hoarse voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?" Bishop Ronis stopped and turned around. The light from the pair of eyes on the thin face seemed to be burning two flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hongpao said: "Students never dare to threaten the teacher just want to remind the teacher. If you hold this magic ceremony in this wild land, students can guarantee that they will not hurt. Innocent civilians. If the teacher refuses to do so, the students naturally do not dare to reluctantly. Only then can the leaves of this world tree be handed over to other people in the guild. How do they use it? Believe the teacher and guess what it is. The consequences."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of Ronis did not speak. The light inside the pair of scorpions also swayed and finally came back silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The teacher's kindness will always remember." The red robe was on the ground. Bishop Ronis did not answer her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red robe said: "This ritual is based on the magic of Sandro's teacher. Only your 'live corpse' can bring the energy of these corpses. Fully activated and synchronized. Please turn these corpses into living corpses as much as possible and then focus on the magical array. Then I use my magic to coincide with your mana and maintain. Finally, the most important thing is Luo. Nice teacher, you must use the resurrection of the world tree's vitality to unify all the magic power into a whole life. Although the resurrection is only a theoretical spell, but with the vitality of the world tree leaves and the teacher's own White magic is definitely no problem for this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can such a ritual really work?" asked Sandrug. "It seems that there has never been such a magical ritual. Is this magical array that you rushed to draw really useful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hongpao said "I like the phrase you once taught me. 'The predecessors are all about it, not for repetition.' I have been studying this magic more than a decade ago. I was just interested in it. I have been I wonder if it would be a effect if our three strongest magic users could combine our completely different mana. It wasn't until two years ago that I got this magical array to get the world tree. After the leaf, I specifically studied the power of it. I can be sure that this magic is absolutely feasible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, then it started." Sandro heard a lot of eagerness to try. He raised his hands and slowly began to mourn the mantra. A blue-and-white light began to dance between his hands and shined on the surrounding bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpses in the valley slowly began to wriggle. At the beginning, only one or two slowly stood up and gradually increased. In the end, hundreds of bodies stood up from the pool of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actions of these bodies were slow and slow, but as Sandro continued to mourn the mantras, the movements of these bodies became more and more The flexible and soft action room is exactly like being alive. The corpse began to rush toward the leaves of the world tree on the rock. A corpse constantly overlaps with each other as the corpse accumulates higher and higher. The corpse movements in the back were more and more flexible and agile. They began to climb like other apes, and other corpses continued to accumulate in the high places to form a corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the continual accumulation of the body, Sandro began to show a strenuous look and his hands began to tremble slightly. This is, after all, the manipulation of hundreds of bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
