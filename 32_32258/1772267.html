			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clouds in the sky are constantly attracted by the magical elements of Aiden’s body, and they are compressed from the surrounding and form a circle of 100 meters around the center of Aydin. Clouds. The two divisions behind Aiden’s master are already pale. They feel that this piece of the film does not seem to be a cloud but a myriad of small lightnings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The stars are flying??" The two * divisions screamed at the same time. Both of them are air system * but they are scared by this magic of the air system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really not a curse, but if it’s just from the lethality and scope of the person, it’s also the same as the curse. . That must be the practice of cultivating individual elemental magic to the top of the purer fire than the fire of the fire. Even the four towers of the tower of the four elements of the magic of the elemental magic are only the masters of Aiden and The former water tower tower master can use this level of single-level magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already some cold sweat on the forehead of Master Eden, but his expression is not showing signs of weakness, but he is laughing like a wolf looking at the rabbit under his mouth. A moment and then shouted at the whispering of the following: "Hand over the leaves of the world tree or I will slap the whispers to the ground"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through the air magic The sound after the spread covered the entire whispering sensation like a thunder. It’s just that no matter what kind of thunder is not the same as this sound, it is mixed with the chill of the heart and lungs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a Necromancer!" Luya looked up at the large cloud of infinite Thunder and the shadow of the central floating figure that had already taken her. The beautiful face is distorted. She flew to the center of the top of the ancient tree of war where there was an altar that was raised by the old tree itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she did not see this person in the air with a silver mask unique to the Necromancer, but this familiar voice can feel even so far The volatility of the air magic has long proved that it was the sinful sin of the whispering sorcerer a year ago and the necromancer who later chased them all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just she knows. All the elves who heard the voice of Master Eden were almost aware of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Master Eden is not a threat to him. With that loud drink. The brilliance of the clouds that he condensed with magic condensed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up from the whispering forest, you can see that the little golden cloud suddenly disappeared and made countless white balls flying down like a summer season. Hail. These small white balls of light are not falling straight down. Instead, it spreads out like a rain and scatters into a large area under the whisper of Mori to form a small meteor shower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when these small white balls of light were coming into contact with the forest, the huge elf war tree trembled with a low-pitched sound as if it were a heavenly giant. Moved. A green light curtain appeared in the sky above the forest. The white ball's falling degree does not seem to be fast. It doesn't seem too big, but the moment it just touched the green magic light curtain immediately produced a fierce explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explosive power of a light ball cannot be compared with the magic of a thunderstorm, but the three four are added up and this is almost the same from the cloud. There are at least hundreds of scattered. These are also the superposition of the sum of the power of the magical light spheres containing the elements of thunder. At least there are hundreds of thunderous bombs that are destructive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge explosion of dense sounds has become a huge wave of whispering whispering on the top of the eye is a sea of ​​explosions. The airflow in the trembling explosion on the ground was even blown down by the magicians of the whispering Mori and the gas elements of the sitting. Only <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s such a power that everyone can imagine that this forest is like a screen with thousands of arrows penetrating the screen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what makes everyone dumbfounded is the flash of the explosion and the sound of the sound of the entire forest without a tree or even a shortest branch damaged in this explosion. It seems that the huge explosion and the violent wave just had someone put a bunch of huge firecrackers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no damage to the forest because the person has damage to the tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Luya himself, no one heard the constant humming of the war tree in the huge explosion. That is the sorrow of the breakdown of the structure inside the old tree. The ancient tree of war was originally during the period of growth, and the magical explosion that had just been defensive was just too strong. Just like a minor child, he was forced to bear hundreds of pounds of heavy objects. Many growing branches immediately withered and fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
