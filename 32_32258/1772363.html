			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedrus City Lord died and was assassinated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire Oufu has become an active volcano that can be sprayed at any time. The order has been gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are excited orcs everywhere, crying and waving, wielding weapons and hitting the ground and walls. If not some prestigious elders can still stay awake. I am afraid that Oufu is now completely out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sedros is not the god of the orcs, but a thing used for sustenance and worship is sometimes great and noble, but the wild is never A person who is truly worthy of respect and admiration around him is more touching. And Sedros is more worthy of respect and admiration for the orcs. The reason why they can survive to the present can be such a city that was completely unimaginable. It can have a status equal to human beings. All this is given to him by Cedros. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not a god or a person like him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oufu is full of sorrowful screams of the orcs. Almost half of the orcs are in a semi-violent state. The air is everywhere when the beasts are furious. The strong hormonal taste seems to be the animal that Sedros is crazy about, not the orc, but the city he built. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of the city of Oufu is huge. It's completely different from other places. There isn't a bit of turmoil and chaos. It's just a heavy atmosphere that dries almost like a drop of lead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of Cedrus in the main office of the city is still quietly lying on the ground. The room is still full of bloody smell, which is the blood in the body of Cedrus. This energetic old man is now just a quiet corpse in a horrible way to dry up the blood to show the huge wound between his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bloody shackle is placed over the door beam, which is the only clue left by the murderer. Everything in the house has never been moved. This is a straight line and left to Gru to see clearly. He just received the news this morning. Came back from the Sandefes Mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Celester..." Gru stretched out his hand from the beam. This is a cross-like silver plaque engraved with numerous precision patterns on both the blade and the handle. It is the tool used by the church trials to carry out the final death penalty for the sinful sinister pagans. His voice is as heavy as throwing a piece of lead on the ground. His eyes and expressions are not as unpredictable as the deep seas. Although it seems that there has been no change, no one dares to look directly into his eyes or even dare to approach him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orc outside the door choked and said: "There are not so many clues to be found. This room, including the murder of Sedros adults, is best at The elf of the werewolf who followed was checked. Although the elders were very excited, he carefully examined him and said that there was no trace of anyone coming in and there was no smell... but it is clearly the trace of the battle between the master and the assassin..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not a fight, he has no chance to fight at all, and he’s deadly...” The silvery cymbal in the snoring is distorted in the palm of the hand Deformation. "There is nothing else..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The savvy person in charge of the patrol in the south this morning reported that the Wyvern was smelling near a bush. What is the smell of a huge bird? It is estimated that there is a gryphon from there..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Collect all the tribal leaders to hold a meeting immediately." Gru said coldly. . The sound was not shocking but the half-orc couldn’t help but shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru’s hands have been smashed into a mass of iron and flew out and then the walls that were banged with bouldering were smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't agree with this decision." Bolugan stood in a chair and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't hear our problems? We are asking how long it takes for you to gather all the troops to arrange in order to pass in the shortest time... ..." An ogre collar screamed. His eyes are all bloodshot if not the reason that has been cultivated in Oufu over the years. Almost let his crazy anger have long let him tear all the humans he can see into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brugan adults struggled to wave their arms. Even so, his body is much shorter than the beasts sitting on the ground. Like his voice, it seems insignificant: "You. I know that you are very saddened by the death of the adult of Cedros, but you also need to know that it is not reasonable for us to do so..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"This thing is a little weird. Although the life of Cedrus is what Celeste has already wanted, but in short, it seems that this is not a big deal... If they really have the ability to do this, they should have done this before. Only assassination..." Bolugan’s efforts to raise his voice were almost screaming. "And. Our strength is in potential and exhibition... we don't need to use it now..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bigger roar is almost going to take the Bolugans After shaking a few excites, the orc who had already fallen into a half-madness almost rushed toward him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ration has no effect in the face of out-of-control feelings, especially these are orcs who are inherently instinctively far from rational. Although Ming <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know this, but Bolugan is still very reluctant to sigh and whisper: "Cedrus is dead!" ... although I respect him, but those who are already dead are not worth living for him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loud bang of Bolugan Thoroughly stumbled over the debris of the chair, like the rain, there is a chair back behind him<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more behind the wall and his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t have time to comb his head today and he’s probably unclear from now on. He’s now almost bald. The original, unkempt head is now left with some staggered short piles and other heads and the wall of the chair behind him smashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't say these may irritate my nonsense to answer questions." Gru sat across from the opposite side and seemed to move without any tone. His eyes were so deep that he could swallow people. It is crushed into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the orcs are quiet and just so excited that the orcs who can tear him into pieces at any time are all moving. They all look at Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweat on the head of Bolugan’s head is like a torrent of torrents. He knows that as long as he’s a little bit full of this dance, it’s him. The head of the brain is broken. And this is not a deliberate leftover. Maybe it's a little bit of distance in Gru's heart or on a certain muscle in his hand.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows why these orcs who have considerable self-control and rationality are out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anger is not simply because they themselves are more from fears that they themselves are not aware of. This fear comes <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self and the people who dominated the one who has influenced them from the deepest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; murder is not the usual murderous suffocation but from the deeper no one can feel but no one can be unaffected by the murderous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru does not seem to be too excited and angry, but in fact he may be the most angry and excited person here, just this kind of excitement and anger The murderous and killing that has been hidden deep enough but has spread from the deepest has spread to all around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These orc leaders can’t feel anything. The deepest instinct of the soul tells them that they are right next to a wild and furious behemoth. They were torn into pieces so they were so anxious and angry that they could not suppress themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Polupan is well aware that the unnecessary insistence under such circumstances is completely unnecessary. He didn't want to be the first torn into pieces by this huge beast. He sighed long and replied, "I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Oufona The atmosphere that is about to explode is opposite. Caloundo is still so calm and calm. It is like never to be born here, especially this small cabin that is lonely here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know that the response of Oufu is like that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fare of the beast is expected to be far It’s simpler than expected, because their reactions are very straightforward. Oufu is not a guy without a mind, but most of them are beasts with simple minds and strong impulses. What cards are in their hands, I know so, what will they react to? Clearly..." The red cardinal dressed as a civilian is smiling and confident. He held the half of the scepter of Ayr's mother in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
