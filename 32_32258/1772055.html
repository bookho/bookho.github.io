			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa does not believe in places like heaven or hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was indulging in the magical world of the old adventurer at the age of seven or eight, he thought that the heavenly hell that is often heard in the side population is the same nature. Explore the novel world of search. Therefore, when the old pastor in the village preached, he inquired with pure curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old pastor is naturally happy to see a child who is so interested in theology but he proposes a series of broken casseroles in the end to explore the animal habits. The question made the old pastor unable to answer. When he asked why God did not eat anything, why did the goddess and the goddess stay in the sky for so long, but did not give birth to some little gods, and when they were smashed like the pigs in the village, they were taken by the adults next to them. They ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has never seen evidence of existence in these two places and no one has gone to heaven and hell like the old adventurer who has been to the outer world. Then come back and explain it to him in detail. So when he woke up, the first consciousness was that he was still dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pressed his stomach intact. The muscles are still so tight that the internal organs inside the skin are still normal in the place where they should be. He even felt that his body had never been so energetic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it a dream? However, I was stunned by the red robe and squirted into the spring water. I felt that there was no illusion and that all the memories before were smooth and there was no feeling of confusion in my dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa climbed up from the ground. This is a strange place that seems to be a tree hole and looks like a house. Twisted branches and vines gathered together to form a wall around the branches where the branches themselves circumvented to form windows and doors. The vines stretched out on the walls on both sides and entangled in the air. It seemed to be a bed. A few strange trees seemed to be used as desk stools. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be the home of the elves. Asa knows that this strange house often heard a lot about the elves from the dwarves when he was in his hometown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves live in the inaccessible forests. Although they are similar to humans, they cannot be attributed to the low-level concept of 'sub-humans' like those orcs. They have dwarves. The same is a race with its own unique culture and lifestyle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the dwarves and elves have some kind of blood relationship. The dwarves are very disdainful about this same race. They are usually used to stab and ridicule others. Use the elves as a metaphor. From their mouths, the elves seem to be ignorant of the idiots who are self-righteous and lack of emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a footstep outside the wooden house and the two elves came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the silver of a black woman of two elf men of a man and a woman. At least from the outside, they look like they have no taste of wood. The appearance of the two people is very handsome and beautiful. From the human point of view, the long ears protrude from the shoulders of the shoulders and appear to have a kind of elegant temperament. It's hard to imagine them being close relatives with those chunky and dwarf dwarves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male elf said to Asa with a gentle and steady voice: "Hello human. Let me introduce myself first. I am the most noble and pure elf of this big 6 The elders call me Clan by your human beings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the dwarves, they can't judge their age with their looks. Asa has seen a dwarf who is younger than himself but has a big beard. This elf who looks like a young man may be a few hundred years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Clan pointed to the elf girl next to her: "She is Luya." Asa suddenly said that she was the one she saw in the spring water. Elf girl. Now she is looking at herself with an emotional look that the elf should not have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the wooden bench, sitting down on the wooden bench, Elder Clan looked at Asa with a calm look, "You are the first to enter in the last five hundred years." The human beings inside this forest. We never welcome the humble humans, but after all we see that you are helping us to deal with the dark servant in danger of life. And for some other reason we brought you to this. Where humans are involved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa listened quietly to him and said that it was a good misunderstanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That really is the leaf of the world tree. Fortunately, only one was taken away, which means that there are at least two more opportunities. Asa is still quiet. He can see that it is not the thing that he can take away if he is pleading. It is best not to expose it to the situation. He tempted: "How many leaves remain in the world tree?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf girl Luya turned her head away. Although there is no expression on her face, this action has expressed sufficient contempt. Elder Clan’s demeanor and tone are still not so volatile. It is still so gentle and calm: “There is no world tree. The leaves of the world tree are not real leaves. It is the relic left by the god of all things.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree is a kind of leaf that is very powerful. Asa recalled that the expert-level translation of Chris had slammed her mouth and imagined a punch on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you tell me about the cause and effect of this matter?" At this point, Asa also wants to understand everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Clan is silent. The face of the ancient well is still so gentle. He silently looked at Asa with undisguised eyes. It is not because of the scrutiny of the relationship but the hesitation as the distinguished lord is considering using a family tree to show his family. Fortunately, he finally spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our family of elves have lived in this forest since ancient times. It is the source of all the elves of the Big 6 and the guardian of the light. In tens of thousands of years Together with the entire forest, we guard the two gods left by the gods of Mafa, the three world tree leaves and the sun well. According to the legend we have passed down, there is a god at the southwestern edge of the distant 6th. The evil that stays there. When the world begins to chaos, it will be opened and sealed, and everything will go to ruin. Only the power of the Sunwell and the life force of the leaves of the world tree can destroy the evil." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although we never touched the outside world, other elves of the outside world have been reporting to us. We know that the whole world has begun to confuse us." The situation in which the elves and the orcs live in harmony with nature has completely lost their balance. This is all because you humans have forgotten the belief in God and the awe of nature and even come to this sacred forest. Building the city. You also destroyed the ordinary life of the orcs. Now those surviving beasts are about to go crazy with the whole world. The most important thing is that human beings have been completely attracted by the darkness around the evil thing and have produced a death. "Dark power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We took advantage of the golden eclipse ceremony that took place over the forest for a hundred years. At that time, the original constant solar well power would be renewed. Adjusting the volatility We take the most gifted people of the family to accept this power preparation and use it with the leaves of the world tree to fight against the darkness. But unfortunately at that time, it was also the time when Sunwell lost the power to protect this forest. We don’t know Why do dark servants know this? He took this opportunity to destroy our rituals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The final result, you also know the dark servant belt I walked the leaves of a world tree, and the power that fell into the well of the sun well when you were finished in our ceremony was fully automated into your dying body. In the water, the life of the leaves of the world tree is overflowing, so that power transforms and heals your wounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power should have flown into me." In the body." The girl Luya said with her own pearls that were fed with pigs with a little anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for me to fall in, it’s the red robe who pulled you out, and most of the time it’s as good as dealing with the fat pig’s local official. Asa stared at her and glanced at it. Thinking of her standing in the well suddenly felt that it was difficult to imagine how such a beautiful thing would become an ugly dry body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the ceremony was destroyed, it was not completely irreparable. The power of the sun well should not be exhausted but stay in your body. The kind of sacred power that cannot be used by your human filthy body can only be combined with the noble blood of our divine power. We must find a way to take this power out and then the leaves of the remaining two world trees. Fusion is already our only hope against the darkness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude and tone of Elder Clan is so flat and steady from beginning to end but as if The self-righteous temperament that the dwarves said made him have a kind of courtesy of the object, but his words did not hide the contempt for Asa's human identity. "Before you have to stay here. Fighting against darkness and death is also your responsibility as a life-giving person. You should be honored to be a humble human being able to participate in this sacred plan." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
