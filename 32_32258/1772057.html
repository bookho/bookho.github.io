			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun well is in front. There are two shadows in the middle of the moonlight reflected by the well water. Asa knows that it is the leaf of the world tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the Sunwell can shock any creature to give them fear and fear from the soul outside the forest, even if someone is forced to enter the forest with this pressure Hundreds of dead wood guards outside the forest will also have unrelenting attacks, so the elves are not guarded. Moreover, in their great culture, the sun well and the leaf of the world tree were originally inseparable. They never thought about taking the leaves of the world tree from the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa cares about another role of the Sunwell. Under the influence of it, the magic of anyone other than the Elf can not be used in the forest. This is why the red robe people only dare to enter the forest when they are eclipsed. The knife has fallen on the grass outside the forest. Now even the magic can not be used is equal to completely unarmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he must not wait for the golden ring food to hear that the next time is one hundred and thirty years later. No matter from which point of view, today's opportunities are quite good. At least the more than 100 dead wood guards cleared by the red robe have not been added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large area of ​​the surrounding area that was originally a scorched earth has grown out of a tall tree. A few days ago, Asa witnessed Elder Clan with two pieces of world tree leaves holding the water of the sun well and sprinkled it on the ground. New tree buds and grass rushed out of the scorched earth. Listening to Luya said that the burned place and the dead wood guards can be fully restored in one month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the bright moonlight Asa, you can see that there are a lot of dry branches in the saplings that are inserted on the ground. It is the same as malnutrition. But after a month, they will become a huge monster with a height of five or six people who can crush a portrait into a meatloaf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When approaching the Sunwell, he was almost completely surrounded by dead wood guards. I thought that the scene before it was burned down could not help but a cold war suddenly felt that the red robe was very respectable. If it weren't for his fire, he would just sneak up in the middle of the night and only become a croissant or a pile of minced meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa picked up a leaf from the well. He knows that this is a treasure, but he only needs one piece of it. If this kind of thing doesn't need to be carried on his body, he will undoubtedly find trouble for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the moonlight, I can’t see the thrilling color of the original leaf, but it’s just a feeling that green can seem to scatter from above. a breath of life. Asa can see that this is probably not the same as the leaves on the leaves. The entire blade and the underlying petiole are all integrated. Holding something that is said to be a fetish, there are some unexplained excitement in his heart that the finger is actually shaking slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" A bright, light voice like the moonlight rings behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa was like a leopard who was suddenly pierced into an icicle and slammed out and rushed out. The other party did not have the slightest reaction time and was pressed by him. Pour the throat into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver on one side spreads out on the ground and reflects the moonlight in the sky, which makes her Qingyue beauty not smothered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; killed her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time that I’m in the mind of Asa’s mind. The tense atmosphere made him even bleeding and scented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her white neck is under her grip. The touch is delicate and slender and soft, and it can be easily folded into two sections with a little effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her tree house was just in the place where Asa had just passed, and she probably noticed the sound of Asa and followed it. Excessive simplicity made her unsuspecting and did not want to inform other elves. Asa was attracted by the leaves of the world tree and did not notice her close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one else can let other elves know. Elder Clan said that their noble elves were violent and did not want to use them. But this situation is not a last resort but a last resort. The leaves of these two world trees are their only remaining gods and their solar wells in their bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa has seen the elves practice bows. No matter which elf can be used to string two apples together with an arrow shot from a long bow at 100 meters away. If you are alarmed by other elves, even if you are the most agile wild leopard, you will become a hedgehog before you run out of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s other hand held her slender hands together and pressed her foot to the ground and pressed her foot against her body. She struggled hard though her strength and slender limbs were not commensurate but she couldn't move at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her face gradually began to appear in the moonlight, a bleak painful expression, this pain and anger combined to make her face that does not eat human fireworks evolved A vivid and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of both of them is very tight and the body temperature is felt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand on her throat can feel that she is exhaling desperately, but how hard she can't break the suppression on her throat. Even if the muscles of the chest are separated from her chest, she can feel that her heartbeat is getting faster and faster. Asa knows that she will stop for a while after a few twitches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her beautiful face began to distort the heart and the beat has reached the limit. Asa suddenly gave birth to the urge to let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t let go! With her exhalation is definitely a shout that can call all the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her slender body suddenly violently twitched and almost broke away from Asa’s suppression and then softened. Like a device that is too sporty, it suddenly breaks the most important string. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa jumped from her like a power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has completely lost her movements. The living struggling expression just disappeared on her face. The moonlight showed the whiteness on her already white skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa suddenly vomited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. She should not die but may only be shocked. Asa took a long breath and fixed his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of insurance, it should continue to be very positive in the past<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa slammed his head. There should be no need to shock like this. It may take a while to wake up to see her slim body shape will not be very good, let alone she may have been really <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa Pick up the leaves of the world tree on the ground and run towards the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he just ran out of the open space. I heard that Luya’s voice rang from far away. "Everyone is coming out that the human has stole the leaves of the world tree." Her physical condition is obviously much better than that of Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s mood slammed in a complicated way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The depths of the forest have already sounded the unicorns. All the sounds in this quiet forest can be passed very far, including the footsteps of his running. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muscles of the legs have reached the limit so fast that even their balance seems to be lost at any time. Asa desperately flies in the forest. He has entered the outer periphery of the forest and can escape if he has more than two miles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I saw a dead wood guard who was rushing all the way, he lifted a huge foot and stepped on it. Asa didn't circumvent any action that didn't stop or even change himself. He still headed down to the front and rushed to the huge branch that was pressing down to turn him into a muddy mud. He didn't dare to stop the hooves that he could hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Long’. His back clearly felt the dry wind guarding the wind pressure from the pedals and a few splashes of mud hitting his back. His degree is faster than the reaction of these wood squats just enough to rush before he stepped on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Assad is not happy. The moonlight is very bright. He sees very clearly that he has stood in front of a row of dead wood guards. The sound of the hooves in the back is getting clearer and clearer. How fast he has two legs, but four feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dead wood guard in front of the tree slowly raised his hand and bent down towards him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good opportunity. In the rushing run, Asa's knees slammed his hands and held another roll. It just stopped when the huge slap shot was taken. The slap in the face of some of the end of the small branch in front of Asa smashed his face in a burning pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
