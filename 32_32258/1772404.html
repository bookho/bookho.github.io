			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the whirlwind valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little black stars on the altar are constantly humming. The death of the entire 6-year-old condensed in the Shadow Mountain has begun to be slowly activated. The ancient demon who has been sleeping for hundreds of millions of years is exhaling the first breath. The raging black atmosphere of the sea of ​​anger is constantly filled from the wide body of the sword and filled with the surrounding space. The richness is not the breath but the naked death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of the most powerful dragons in the death of the strong can not survive but there are several human figures they stand or sit still as if and The sculpture of the Obsidian Mountain is a seamless one. That is the master of the Devils of the Deva Valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brand in the body gives them the privilege that all creatures in this world have never had to survive in the Star of the Dark Star, but also live in the Shadow Mountain Range, but also Give them the fate they can't escape. And now each of them is here to feel the fate step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is probably no word more than the word 'fate'. It seems that people who are a little smarter and more determined can not care. But only when the irresistible person who perceives the fact that he is overthrowing step by step will truly understand that he is just a small ant ant between heaven and earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone here is a wise wise man who is a top sorcerer. Now I can only wait quietly here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No escape, no matter where and when, as long as this destructive artifact is fully uplifted, the soul of the soul in their body will be at the same time Become an undead creature that is faithful to the king of the dead. In the end, there is a corpse with no self-awareness or a lich who can keep a little thought. No one knows or wants to know, but they know that it is not far away. The gradual volatility and agitation of the atmosphere means that the King of the Dead is moving forward step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They know more clearly than anyone else that the meaning of the Dark Star is better than anyone else to understand that this fate is unstoppable. Just as strong people can't resist the laws of nature, it's not a difference in power but a difference in essence. And maybe they are the strongest group on the 6th. As soon as you get close to the king of the dead, even your self-consciousness will be erased as the undead servant of the king of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vadini is among them. Her corpse-like face is still unhappy and only the green fire in her eyes is constantly flashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no Necromancer to go and spend a lot of time with her. This dark star is no longer meaningful in all the feuds in the gradual strong atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly. The lich turned to look down at the top of the mountain. A figure in the far bottom of the valley is moving. The flame in her eyes flashed and jumped off the platform on the top of the mountain. A pair of wings consisting of pure black magical power and a dead green flame illusioned behind her and flew down his thin, thin body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer on the top of the mountain only gave her a look. Some did not even look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru, who was stalking in the valley, looked up slightly and saw Vedinina fall from the sky with a large group of black and green fog around her body. His front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are you going?" The Lich looked at Sandru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will leave you unrelated to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the dead spirits in this The mages are waiting for the great moments, but you are so curious. I am very curious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my own business. I call you Let go." Shan Delu sighed and drank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is where the gargoyle is placed. Are you going to get a gargoyle?" Vadrina looked at the direction Sandro was going. “Do you still need to use a gargoyle to go far away from your corpse? From your demeanor and spirit, it seems that something has been created to cheer you up?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has nothing to do with you. I told you to let me hear it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vadina did not seem to hear. She was silent. Say: "I heard that I finally had something that made people feel very surprised. You know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I mean you and I have heard a lot of unexpected things since they left here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He actually has a mood to come back Tell you. I am a little surprised."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not monitoring you with the eagle eye. Don't look at me as a guardian in the dark star. Next to the Lich, my strength is far away from both of you. My embarrassment is not difficult for you. It’s just that you can’t help you to go to the whispering forest. Sunwell seems to have some residual effects, even if it doesn’t affect you. It doesn't matter if it affects me. It seems that there is a big turnaround there. Otherwise, you won't be so spirited. Can you tell me if you have trouble?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shandle faintly replied: "There is no turning point. I just went to be a clown with Magnus. They will still be able to make birth and can't do anything."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't do it? What are you doing now?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do what I should do. It's none of your business." Sandruton paused to look at the Lich student with a strange look. "It's that you specifically asked me if I felt some accidents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, things are so frank, I was a little surprised." Lich's words Very hoarse. Her voice has always been hoarse like a creature's voice, but now the hoarseness is not just a voice that can feel the hoarseness of her words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh. You will be surprised. I thought everything was in your grasp of your grasp." Sandro was full of ridicule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not God, although I can grasp the context of fate, but still can't master all the fate in the wheel." The flames in the sorcerer's eyes are weak. Then it seems to be re-ignited with new energy. "But the process is not important after all. The result is the result. You see, as I said, this great moment has finally arrived in the new world and will start because of my promotion..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Win for you. It won't take long for everything that you hate to look down on will be transformed into a powder with your great push... and finally including you is the result you want."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just follow the fate of the trajectory to promote history. But the teacher, why can't you understand that this greatness is still immersed in the humble values ​​of humanity." The voice of the lich The flame in her eyes is no longer fluctuating. She now looks like a statue of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru did not pay any attention to her bypassing Vedina to continue in the original direction. "I am a human being. So I can only do what one can do now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't let you go." Na raised her hand and her blackness and green flames rose into the sky. "Although I don't know what you are going to do, but most of them want to hinder this upcoming great moment as a Necromancer. This is absolutely not allowed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Shandru suddenly turned around and his eyes were all bloodshot looking at Ved Nina: "Do you dare to do it with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am preventing you from making a big mistake." Ved Nina said faintly. The dry body seems to be standing still, it is not easy to shake the shelf with a little impact, but even Sandy looks small and weak like a big ear in front of the magical atmosphere that she swells around her body. . This is no longer a monolithic magic power even if it is a magical transformation of an undead monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru is angry and laughs and laughs like crazy. "Well, you dare to do it with me. Okay, I can't think of it, I can't think of it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know this power this identity of the Necromancer The body still has this great ideal... This is all that the teacher gave me. But now I am not my own will. Is this the black star's will you still can't feel it?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This breath and the flames are so powerful that it is not her strength but the power of the Dark Star. The other point that other Necromancers didn't pay attention to Vadrina was that they didn't have the ability to care. In the present, the physique of the savage Lich is the carrier that can really make the brand of the Dark Star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
