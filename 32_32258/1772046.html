			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After spending a lot of energy from the Wangdu Guards, the terrorist prisoner who had fled for two months was finally captured and will be burned in the square in the center of Wangdu this morning. dead. There are many people in the streets and lanes to celebrate that the king is finally safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa mixed in the crowd of people watching the prisoner was put up by several soldiers from the prisoner to bundle the pillars around the pile of wood . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a dead person. The face of the thin body is scattered and the face that is full of scars and blood is not clear. With the tsunami-like shouts of the mountains, the wood piles ignited a majestic fire. Only a few blinks of effort drowned the entire figure in the flames. The person seemed to have not even had a scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is so efficient that Asa feels better. In a sense, this person can also be considered as a state to cover up a secret that could endanger the country. Dedicating to the country is also a deadly way to die. But this person does not want to die for Asa himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national event is like this. Asa remembered the words of the Duke of Mulak last night. Although there may not be anyone who hates this person and wants him to die, but after a series of intricate but true values, this person must also be burned here as a black carbon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘砰’ The abdominal cavity of the prisoner was blown up by the hot air, and the crowd’s exhilarating screams filled with cruel pleasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the difference is that he is the protagonist in the fire. The sultry heat wave came to the face and Asa suddenly chilled out and crowded out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't know much about national events and doesn't want to care. He is now busy with a small personal matter that is more important to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night he rummaged through the books in the Shudron bookcase and didn't see anything about the 'leaf of the world tree'. It is still only in the second half of the book in which he practiced meditation, there is a page in it, but the page is still the kind of incomprehensible text except for the words of the title, the leaf of the world tree. When I went to ask Sandro in the morning, it was rare to see that Sandru was flustered and said that he was going out of the city. Asking him to panic and doing what he did, he actually said with a grin: "Go to see a girlfriend." Then he ran with a bag of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Asa himself has always felt quite strange. Since childhood, he has heard about the most dangerous places and the most mysterious things on the Big 6 in the old adventurers. Even in the place of the Lizard Marsh, he knew everything about it before he even went in. Even so, he never heard of the ‘whispering tree’ tree, the name of the whispering forest, which has never been heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now that there is only such a clue, it is only going to start. Asa suddenly remembered that there might be some clues in the library at the School of Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to the Magic Academy and walk into the library. Probably still in the morning, there is no one in the library. The huge building is divided into dozens of large rooms. Each room has a ‘geo’ ‘history’ ‘military’ and other words on the door of each room. In each room, there are dozens of long bookshelves that are densely packed with books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa went to the 'plant' classification room to check the catalogue and looked at the flowers straight. It was hard to find an introduction to the 'world tree'. Trees. After a few laps, I had to walk into the room marked with the word "language" and hope to see a dictionary that could find the words on the translation book. But in the face of the tens of thousands of books, he immediately knew that it was impossible. He didn't even know what the words were on the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Asa wandered around the bookshelf and wanted to find someone to ask for it, but I didn’t see one in the room. It was not until the last two bookshelves that Asa finally saw a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is wearing a white robes worn by students in the School of Magic. The very slim figure is facing the Assass on the ground and concentrating on the books. . This kind of game Asa often played with several children before the age of five to see who can stack the book the highest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey." Asa greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person seems to have been so frightened and jumped from the ground and hardened the stack of books. The man turned to Asa and was now a woman’s left eye with a bruised and bruised post. Look carefully at the girl who was saved by the girl who was saved the night before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's you." Asa had some accidents but it was just right. She seemed to be a student here to help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not an administrator?" She breathed a sigh of relief and a confused look. "Who are you? Do you know me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I am a friend of your sister." Asa replied and pulled out the book. "You help me look at it"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Nonsense. My sister doesn't have a friend like you." Her wariness seems to be strong. "The reason for not getting a good point is to wear a good look at least."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa shook her head helplessly and put a mask on her face. Said: "I remember?" She looked scared. Asa took the mask and put it away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it you? The face is just a mask." Christ looked at him and shook his head. "It’s still not a long hair and a slap in the face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not understand what she was saying, she wrote the book and turned it over to the page. She said: "You can help me to see what text is written here can be found here"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She never looked at the book at the glance Shaking his head in contempt: "Do you understand the basic courtesy? Please help people at least first and politely call them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Mluck please help Let me see what is the word that can find the translation tool."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay. Don't see me, I want to thank you for saving me once. Liz is fine. What is your name?" Cris took the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call me Asa," Asa replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The strange name is like a fool." Cris said with a smug look: "I’m lucky, this is the ancient text before the dynasty. I just happened to be an expert in this area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa surprised and said, "That just ask the experts to help me to see what I wrote above. What.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clyce looked at her heart and took the drum. Many of the above vocabulary and grammar are also weird, and she has no intention of learning at all times, only to understand a quarter. However, Haikou has already boasted that it has been called an 'expert'. It’s probably a bit of a reluctance to string together the things you know. She said in a sophisticated tone: "This said that the leaf is a forest that is difficult to open in a forest that is difficult to open? The strange name is more strange than your name."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a whispering sir?" Asked Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clys said in a tone that the expert should have said: "The translation is not accurate. It should be a 'difficult to open forest'. It says that the forest is in the southeast of the empire. The Enna tree on the south side of Licheng is a kind of tree called Karma. It is a kind of leaf with great strength. It is over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? If you are full of such a big page, won't you?" Asked Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clyss said with a sigh of relief: "It’s just because it’s too inconvenient to use nonsense, then you have to abolish it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Asa doubted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is the ability to recognize it yourself. I told you that you don't believe you don't understand it." Chris said in a lesson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but finally knowing where in the hands of someone, Asason sighed. Looking at the old image of Klis, she didn't make her head so exaggerated today. It was only in the robes, and there were no colorful powders on her face. This showed the girl’s beauty and the bruise on her eyes. It looks a bit funny. Asa reached out and touched her head and pinched her face and said, "Thank you for the expert, please ask for sugar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, oh, oh." Screamed and reached out and hit his hand. Asa smiled and turned and walked out of the room. Suddenly, Chris chased him from behind and stopped him. "I helped you. Why are you leaving?" Asa replied: "I didn't say you would ask for sugar later?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You eat it." Chris's language is like a mercenary in a pub, probably to a friend like the little scorpion. "I am bored to talk with me now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
