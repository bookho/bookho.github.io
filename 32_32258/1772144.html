			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Asa woke up, she only felt that there was no sound in the darkness around her eyes, and if it wasn’t, it’s not the smell of the smoked dead. Behind the cold and hard touch he almost thought he was dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But since there is no death, where is this dark and silent place? This stinking smell is no stranger. This time, you can smell this weird taste when fighting with Bimon, but it is not so strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the body can’t move, it still feels very sensitive. The smell of Bimeng is mixed with the smell of excrement and **, and the other strange smell that can't be said makes him unrecognizable. The humidity in the air is very large. It is a piece of chilly rock. It should be a cave in Bibi. It’s just that there is no light shining through it. I don’t know how deep the cave is deep into the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last memory is only to release the knife and slash the knife and release the vitality that can be extracted from the body of the body. The last strength and consciousness in the body was also taken away and nothing was known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How are other people? Vaguely impressed, when all the people seem to have been lying on the ground, are they all dead? I thought that there was a pain in his heart. Did these orcs who were born and died in the Sandefes Mountains die like this for the food of the Mongolian and Grey Beast? But why would you be in a nest of Bimen? Bimon's simple-minded monster has always had no habit of storing food, not to store a living prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Needless to say, rushing away from here is a good place to stand up and observe the surroundings. But there is no power in the body that can be used. The whole body is only as heavy as the acid filled with lead and the broken pain. Even a finger can't move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method he used to kill Bimeng has already come out of the limits of the body and also the limit of magic. Although Sandru showed him the special ability of the knife, this method is theoretically feasible, but it depends on the situation of the object. Even if the ability of this knife is different, and then his magical power is added to the above, but it is a creature with the most vitality on the 6th. If it wasn't for paralysis, let the vitality of Bimeng distort the body and let Bimeng suffer a little injury. Then he couldn't just pull out the knife and it would be more likely that Bimeng would pass the vitality through the knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally using the huge vitality of Mengmen to attack is more of his ability. If the same person is to dance a weapon that is ten times heavier than his own weight, he will slash others. Although he relied on the deep magical roots given by the sun well and the leaves of the world tree, there is still an incomparable fighting spirit. After all, he still swayed the earth-shattering knife, but the body and the magic are almost broken under the limit. Changing to an ordinary person has already died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time you ate was before the morning. The gray beast's meat is extremely tough and difficult to digest. There are even rumors that half of the magicians who entered the Sandefes are killed by this food. Asa had eaten a lot before, but now I feel that my stomach is completely empty, and I am so thirsty that I feel like I have been in this cave for a whole day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try hard to get up a few times. Helpless, the body does not listen to the pain of a little bit of muscles. I want to give myself a reluctant use of a healing spell, but the magical structure in the whole body is like a hammer hammered glass that can never be used even if it is not completely crushed. And after a few failed pains, I just woke up and my consciousness began to blur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed and began a deep meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has inexplicably produced it since he slowly learned more and more about the stories behind this meditation from Sanddros de los A little resentment that can't be said. Not disgusting but afraid. He always felt that this thing would take him to a place he didn't want to go to, so he tried to use less and practice less, especially the deepest meditation. But now meditation in this case may be the only way to give birth to a miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the meditation slowly deepens, the consciousness gradually becomes more and more indifferent and clearer. He saw the scars in his body because of the extreme limits. The muscles and blood vessels broke. There are countless tiny cracks on the bones. The magic of the bones is like a spider web. The whole body can almost be said to be a thousand holes. Under the influence of meditation, those scars began to heal with a very slow degree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is supposed to be a more confusing magical fluctuation in the deep inner mountains of Sandefes. Far more intense and purer than in the valley, like a breeze, smashing through the body and passing through the glass as unimpeded. This fluctuation is very dull, not even that people who are particularly sensitive are not aware of it, but they are everywhere and never stop, just like some of the attributes inherent in this space. This volatility is very turbulent and does not have any attributes or meanings at all. However, if you carefully understand it, you may feel that there is a special atmosphere and rules. It’s just that if this breath is completely uncapable, it can’t be described or even truly understood. Only when you don't care, you can know that this breath is omnipresent, but once you want to concentrate on comprehending the meaning of it, you can't have it right away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa has faced many strong men and stood in the world's top magicians. They can all radiate their own compelling magical atmosphere. There is a dark black magical atmosphere like ink, and there is a cold, dead spirit with a dead atmosphere. There is also a white magic like the sun, and there is a flat but sharp sword and invincibility. Destroy all power and vindictiveness. But these powerful breaths are only a small feeling compared to this chaotic and faint magical fluctuation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When faced with powerful forces, you may feel forced to have fear and reverence. But in the face of this strange fluctuation, it only makes people feel small. This is the smallness that people feel before the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that my own insignificance is just calm. For example, the same fish is calm in the ocean without any boundlessness. In the deep meditation, I felt this strange magical wave. Asa unknowingly fell asleep and fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Sandro or other Necromancers know that someone can fall asleep on the way to practicing the supreme Holy Scriptures in their eyes, I’m afraid to vomit blood. . But Asa not only fell asleep but also slept very hard and had a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his dreams, he seems to be on the endless peak of Mount Sandefes overlooking everything between heaven and earth. The ground is colorless, neither black nor white, nor transparent. It can be seen that it is the earth but cannot distinguish the color. Then the radiant sun scatters the radiant light and falls on the ground. It becomes a vibrant green emerald. The green is slowly starting to flock and gather. Gradually, this vibrant green is becoming more and more active and become a wave of life. The entire ocean of the waves has become a turquoise ocean that dances with vitality and vitality. This leaps more and more fierce and finally became boiling green and deeper and deeper from the beginning of the light green to green and then from green to dark green dark green, some of the most violently beaten places have become black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally all the colors on the ground slowly turned black. The pulsating vitality of the ocean has become a pot of boiling water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The innumerable leaps of black gathered together to become the shape of a sword. Then the weapon, which was darker than the darkness, seemed to be a black hole that swallowed everything, and jumped into the earth and made an indescribable sound. There is no exact definition of this sound, including screams, collapse, decay, tearing, burning... that is the voice of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was silence in the earth that all the blacks have dissipated. Heaven is still heaven and earth. This mountain is still this mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, the same situation reappeared. It is also the green radiance of the sun that causes the earth to fluctuate and then it is completely black and then re-emerged to calm... This kind of scene keeps repeating as if it is a rising sun. Asa repeatedly overlooked all this with the top of the mountain. The heart is a mysterious sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how many times these scenes have been mixed and slowly mixed into a time and space that is blurred in the dream. Just seeing the radiance of green, darkness, life and death, intertwined and rotating, and then the scene of this group of movements melted into their bodies. Asa feels that it is not what is just seen but the life of his own body. All the scenes continue to rotate in their bodies and alternate as if they never end...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long Asa was awakened by a subtle footstep. . He subconsciously sat up on his own and was surprised that the body had actually recovered a lot. Although still very weak, the physical injuries have healed and the flow of magic is completely smooth. It is reasonable to say that even if there is a white magic treatment to be restored to this, it will take a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps are the sound of the thick meat pad falling on the rock and the rush is accompanied by a respite. Is it a very young childhood? Asa had no time to think about it and saw a faint light that was a fire. There are two green eyes next to it, the eyes of the werewolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s excitement and joy are no less than him. Did the werewolf appear here and have already stepped out of the Sandefes Mountains? He wants to talk, but he is already weak enough to control his mouth and tongue. It was already his reflexive use of all the power just sitting up. Although the damage to the body has been restored, all the energy in the body has been cleaned up. He is now unable to support himself with a completely empty cloth pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa only vaguely saw the whole picture of the cave under the light of the torch. This is actually a huge cave with more than 100 meters wide and tens of meters high. It is just a gap in the corner. Not far from here is a pile of hill-like bones. This is indeed a cave in Biman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alkin came over and lifted Asa on the ground and carried him to his back. At this time, there were cluttering footsteps and three werewolves ran in. They walked to the place where Asa had just laid, and carried five pockets. Asa only noticed that it was actually the raw ore that they had collected so hard. There were several nails than Mengmeng. From the huge size, it should be that the two of Gukou were killed by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alkin ran out of Asa and slid his face into the hair on his back and closed his eyes. Even so, when he just walked out of the cave, the sun still stabbed Asa’s eyes with tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he heard the heavy footsteps of other werewolves carrying things back and forth and the gasping of Kodo. Alkin seems to have placed him on a Kodo. When the wolves put all the things on, then the fierce bumps and the clumsy footsteps of the two Kodo beasts, the two beasts began to run hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cool sweet taste in the mouth is diluted honey. The feeling of deliciousness made the taste buds in the mouth and the masseter muscles on both sides start to twitch. According to his previous experience, this is the result of at least four days of not eating or drinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air screamed the eagle. Asa’s heart is amazed and it seems to be in the Sandefes Mountains. But what about these other werewolves? How have those ore mines been sent out yet? The key is that the huge and cumbersome beast of Kodo is simply attracting the big eagle and Bimen’s live bait should never enter the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of honey water on the weak physical strength is that the immediate eyes gradually adapt to the light Asa slowly opened his eyes. It is now possible to see the three eagle eagle with a huge wind blowing down. The majestic body of the Sandefes Mountains still connects the ground and the sky around here or in the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two werewolves on two Kodo animals who together lifted a huge arrow. This kind of thing that requires two wolves to be able to use it barely is that the equipment used for defense on the wall is not so much a smashing arrow. Both the range and the power are enough to deal with this huge raptor. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The werewolf aimed at the two great eagle's coming forces to pull the trigger and the giant arrow that pierced the steel shield screamed and shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large eagle is smashed straight through the chest and abdomen and falls straight from the air. There is also a high agility and reaction to avoid the sorrow and leave a lot of feathers and blood foam turned and rushed into the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drop the guns Altun and the other three werewolves together to pick up the flail and the meteor hammer to guard against the last eagle. But this last eagle looked at the companion's death and injury. It seemed that he had smashed a low-altitude turn and re-raised to follow the injured companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hurry up. After an hour or so, they will bring a group of eagle owls and perhaps Thunderbirds." Asa said to Alkin. "How are other people? What the hell is going on for so many days, why haven’t the original mine been taken away?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured no....problem. Others... They are waiting outside...." The werewolf picked up the whip and slammed it on the head of the Kodo beast to leave a bloodstain. The beast screamed and ran faster. It is still the huge bloodstains and trenches that have turned black in front of the valley mouth of Bimeng. There are still only a few huge skeletons left in the body of Bimeng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, the wolves chose the opportunity to enter the valley. At this time, it was the noon Kedo beast that ran out of the valley smoothly. But Asa’s mood is not easy. Although it seems that it has not become the territory of other Bi Meng, the sound and taste of Kodo is enough to keep Bi Meng in other places. There are no more than two behemoths and other behemoths who will chase these prey without any scruples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
