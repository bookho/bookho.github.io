			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cell is now the real cell of Celeste. Pure steel is used to create a half-meter thick wall. There are countless complicated magical shackles engraved on it. It is all about solid defense. The whole cell is a huge iron box. And the iron of this iron box is a masterpiece made by the famous gnome genius and poor life of six or two hundred years ago. At that time, the three thieves who gathered the highest level of the killer guild gave them a whole day to fail to put the lock. turn on. Any other cell and here is completely unarmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only a few hundred people who can be held here for hundreds of years, but there are no ones who can make the whole big 6 smell the same. head. But their treatment is not comparable to the current Asa because Asa's hands and feet are actually tied to the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bundled with the thickness of the thumb, the twisted synthetic chain is twisted together with several wires containing fine iron fine gold Hiliya silver. At a distance, there will be thin metal spikes protruding into the body of the bonder. The curse and the toxins such as degeneration, defeat, etc. can be injected into the demon. The brilliant magical power can gradually make the magical power of the body gradually. Flow out. This was temporarily produced by several sergeants and skilled craftsmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be held here for a while, Asa tried several methods but even these chains couldn’t get rid of it, let alone run away. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complicated lock was twisted and the sound of the door opened. Two people walked in and were Lancelot and the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot does not see anything unusual on the face of the ancient well. Even if he grabbed Asa, the opponent who has repeatedly broken the big things, his face is still no worries. He placed a large chair in his hand and placed it on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope sat on the chair and was exactly lying on it. Compared to Asa just saw him. He now looks at least twenty years old. Those are clearly organized. It seems that only wrinkles that are crystallized and ideologically crystallized now seem to have nothing but aging and weakness. The head and the beard are still a white snow, but there is no trace of the luster before the original radiant scorpion has been a weak turbidity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot left the cell and closed the door. There are only two Asa and Pope left in this huge iron box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gently coughed two pope's eyes on Asa's face. Asa also quietly looked at the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s completely beyond my expectation... Is that a gift that Moriel sent you? It’s a great gift... I can hardly pick up it. "The Pope's voice is very weak, just like at any time, it may not be able to catch up." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But are you finally picking it up? It’s also my surprise." Asa looked at the Pope’s hand and the ring was still in the Pope’s The hand is still the inconspicuous look that seems to spread the goods everywhere. "What I can't think of is that the ring that I have been holding in my hand can actually summon such a thing. If I know it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know you too Can't use it." The Pope waved his hand. He waved his hand very slowly and his voice was weak, but Asa was unconsciously interrupted by him. Even if the local people are weak again, the majesty and momentum between the gestures are not weak, and they are still the most powerful people on the Big 6. “That is the holy instrument that resonates with the entire Glorious Castle. It contains the hopes and ideas of the faith of countless believers for hundreds of years. Can you understand these things? Can you afford it? Only those who can afford it can qualify. The talent of this thing is the king. So this is called the king's ring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you do for me? Because of the relationship between the dark stars predicted?" Sa said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he has been waiting for the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." The Pope nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I told you very much that you all missed it." Asa smiled a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have been trying to catch me. It is for the power of the sun well and the leaves of the world tree. Unfortunately, what you thought was wrong. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" The Pope had some surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? It seems that you have a lot of gains under Nigan. In fact, I also want to ask you about this. You said..." The Pope sat up straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When listening to Asa’s remarks, the Pope sighed for a long time and lay back on the bench. His face was full of surprise. He closed his eyes. Not moving. He will slowly digest the things that Asa just said. After a long while, he opened his eyes and restored the calmness and said: "It's an interesting story..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a story." Asa faint Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know I know what you mean. I can hear that you are not lying." The Pope nodded slowly. "That is to say, there is no great prophecy in this. You have nothing to do with the huge whirlpool of this Necromancer. This is what you want to tell me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Yes." Asa nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I told you that I caught you not because of that prophecy. I didn't care about those things from the beginning." The Pope said faintly Although the scorpion is listless, it is stable like a rock that has settled in a hundred years. "I want to ask you about the situation in the underground of Nigan is just one of the purposes of my visit here. The most important thing is... I want to come and see you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What?" Asa squinted his eyes. If he could, he still wanted to erect his ears. He suspected that his hearing had something wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't believe that this thing of fate is originally the illusion of the weak to create for himself... but... sometimes a lot of coincidences will let People have the illusion of something like 'destiny'. This feeling is very interesting and interesting... especially when you look at you, it will be more interesting... In fact, we are really related..." The Pope looked like It is like saying to him that he is still muttering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What the hell are you talking about?" asked him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope did not talk half-lie on the chair and quietly looked at Asa, who was nailed to the wall not far away. But his eyes gradually slowly moved away. It seems that through the body of Asa, he saw other places in the distance. His look is very weird. It seems to be recalling, but Asa can't distinguish anything from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time the Pope has been so immersed in the strange state of the gods, Asa did not speak. In this huge iron box, one old and one less look at each other but say nothing. The Pope didn't mean to talk. Asa did not know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope finally sighed and looked back. He raised his voice and shouted. Then Lancelot walked in and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This person must be taken care of and must not let him escape. You know it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It’s your majesty." Lancelot features the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this person's good luck seems to have been better all the time. You should also know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that I also know that I made this trick. This should be something he can't get rid of."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, it can be There is no need to use such a complicated means. There is a simpler, more effective and direct way..." The Pope pointed weakly at the chain that seemed to refer to Asa and seemed to point to other places. "I didn't say that as long as he is still alive, he can break two or three hands and feet..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot did not answer directly but was facing The Pope squatted on one knee and said: "Your Majesty is only guaranteed by the honor of the Cavaliers and will never let him escape. Please rest assured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, since you said so Then I was really relieved." The Pope stood up again and coughed twice, then did not look at Asa and turned to walk outside the door. "The belief and loyalty of the Knights of Talis has undoubtedly brought her back to the position of the Knights of the Temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Lance Lott stood up and followed the pope outside the cell to go out and turned his head to look at Asa with a meaningful look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the slammed iron was re-closed with a little light from a small vent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
