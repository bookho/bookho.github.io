			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt and Hilika are stacked on the ground like four pieces of body rubbish. Although it is the lumbosacral, but the visceral things are still not everywhere everywhere, the priests of the castle are naturally able to see that these two fear knights are very beautiful magic works are well preserved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephen halfway through the ground to play with the four wrecks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Stephen, His Majesty, hopes to see your treatment." An old priest came in and said to Stephen. His attitude is very respectful. This is Mr. Stephen. Although he is not a member of the church, he was already a frequent visitor to the Glorious Castle when he was a pope for more than 20 years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephen stood up and talked with Bishop Inham and then nodded to the priest: No problem, I will inform Magnus to scream. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that Magnus is curious about how I will cure your son. After Stephen's exit, Stephen said to Inham, laughing. "But it's not just that he is curious about myself." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two fear knights made by Shant are really rare works of art...the two little guys were almost bathed by the fluctuations of white magic." Even the magic mark in the brain was washed empty. The part of the transformation is still perfect... If it is used as a material for the human body, it is really a good thing... but you have to know that even if it is Sandro and Shant, it is impossible to complete this transformation. After all, your son is still a living person rather than a zombie that can be manipulated at will. Sandro has made him like that unless he has strong white magic to maintain his vitality to ensure that he can live for a long time, otherwise I can only do my best. And to ensure the perfection of this transformation, the intensity and duration of this white magic, even if Magnus and the three cardinals join forces..." Stephen shrugged his shoulders. "Do you understand what I mean? He certainly will not be willing to have a son in his hand. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inham nodded: "Understand." But you can rest assured that the time is up. These problems can be solved. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Even if your son's body is good, but I am conscious of it... Sander's means are very good. If Aescher is still there, we are two." There is hope for people to join hands but now..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inham smiled: "This is a step for Stephen, you don't have to worry about the way I naturally have a solution. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephen frowned, but it was a smiley look at the Cardinal: "Oh? Your method seems to be a lot of wonderful things... even I can't guess it completely..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Hamm shook his head and smiled a bit. Technology is just a good luck. I have recently got some good opportunities. As long as Stephen can be able to bring the children..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stepne waved his hand and said, "No need to say more. You can rest assured that this is a transaction between you and me. It is my reward for you. You told me a lot about what I always wanted to know. He sighed a long, bitterly. "I don't know if I should tell these things to him. He has been living in the prophecy of Akibad's adults for so many years. He has been guarding that damn without regrets." Authentic entrance. Tell him about these things. I don't know if he would think that I was teaching me a nonsense. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The true clearing of the high is in the heart of the heart rather than in the external facts. He must say this. "Inham smiled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe it is like this." But these things are always just a few people who are easy to do. "At least I can't do it. Otherwise I won't go to the Far East for more than ten years." Stephen shook his head and sighed. "I always wanted to know the truth. I didn't think I was more confused when I knew it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only a remoteness that can give people a sense of security and boundaries. Unreal. When you can keep these things in your hands and see the truth, you will lose their original role."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But can put as much as possible It feels good to hold it in your hand." Inham smiled. Take a half of the scepter from his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Stephen looked at the half-shouldered eyes and smiled. "If it was before, I wouldn't be interested in this thing. But now... it's not quite the same. It doesn't matter if you don't need to be clear and high, you can do something interesting..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
