			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The musculoskeletal of the whole body is still dying. Asa finds himself lying on the altar that was hidden under the treasure of gold coins. Under the body is a complex magical array, the black jewel in the center is exuding the majestic vitality, but the magical array has been stained with blood, by his blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood is left from a wound in his wrist artery, the wound is neat, and it has just been cut shortly. His hand was placed on top of the black gem, the blood was still flowing out, and the black gem was almost completely immersed in the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa suddenly woke up and jumped up, healed the magical power everywhere, and the wound on his wrist immediately stopped bleeding. A few meters away from him, red hair, a woman in a black leather coat is looking at him. The face with a sharp and angular face is now strange and suspicious. It seems that her heart is more suspicious than Asa. More too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? Why can't I feel the brand of the Dark Star from your body? How can you not have the smell of the Dark Star in your blood? How can you In the shadow mountain range?" Morial's voice is rolling, with incomparable surprise and anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stunned at the woman who was fascinated by the Black Dragon. He was shocked and angry, and he still didn’t understand what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you be the person of the Necromancer?" Moriel roared and the cave was shaking. This grand and fascinating voice comes from the body of such a woman, which makes people feel uncomfortable. She seems to be angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not..." Asa shook her head and answered slowly. His eyes have already become red, and he can feel a few hops under the anger of the blood vessels on his head. If he talks about anger, he promises that the anger in his heart is definitely more than the redhead woman in front of him. Be angry a thousand times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter who, after hard work to save the other party, he was almost not angry when he was killed by the other side. He really can’t wait to punch him. This face is smashed in front of me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Asa can hold back, even if he is angry a hundred times, he can only hold back. He is well aware of the strength gap between himself and the dragon that has recovered his strength. Reason makes him know that if this punch is really thrown out, it is definitely his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mollier didn’t talk any more, just looking at Asa with the huge yellow dragon eyes. There is still no murderousness, and some are all kind of special momentum that is emitted from the body from each cell. Any human. As long as it is still human, it is impossible to feel the pressure under such an imposing manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not speak. His whole body is tense, and his body is weak after he loses blood. Even if he is not weak, he does not seem to have any room for resistance. This is just a natural reaction of the body in the face of imposing manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt and Hilika have moved themselves from the sunken rock wall, and the broken body seems to have recovered, just like two The shackled shackles tried to move the body away from the corpses that had been left in the Knights of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, a long sigh erupted from Moriel’s nose. Her expression is a bit strange, and the imposing manner is also reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Asa faintly and said, "Okay, let's relax, although you have the leaves of the world tree and the meditation of Archibald. The most important thing is that there is no brand of black star in the body. It is useless to kill you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No use?" Asa stunned, he didn't understand What does it mean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's talk about it, humans. Let me talk about how you came from this dedicated channel of the Necromancer, and since you are not How can the people of the Necromancer Association have these two necromancers? There seems to be a lot of things that are unexpected to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although still I don't know what is going on and it is getting more and more confused, although I still feel very angry. But Asa did not feel relieved. At least Morley seems to have no intention of owning his own life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shadow Mountain Range is like a huge net, the length of the battle stretches across the earth, there is almost no life in this network, all the vitality They are all swallowed up by the silence and darkness in this net. Any animal that succumbs to it here, the result of the animal, can only be killed in this breath.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of this mountain range. A very high solitary peak rises straight into the end. The peaks of dozens of miles have risen above the summit and it is just a platform of tens of meters square. At the center of the platform, a black mist is surrounded by an ancient altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless temperament unique to the Shadow Mountain Range is already as strong as the essence on the platform of the top of the mountain. It is a breath of death, a black breath. The fog on the altar is the one with the strongest, purest and most concise atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that the atmosphere of the mist is filled into the mountains, but the atmosphere of the whole mountain is automatically gathered here, and then exudes, Repeatedly and repeatedly. This peak is the axis of the huge net of the entire mountain range. The black mist is the one at the center of the axis. Essence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in this place where the deadliest and strongest, an old man is standing on the platform and staring at the black mist. The old man is very old, squatting on his back, and the wrinkles on his face are as if the ugly face is wrinkled and pieced together, and it is very thin. Even this standing is not very stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ragged robes blew in the mountain wind, and it seems that even his people could be blown out by the hurricane at this peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the strongest beast. In this rich death, it is not reliable for a long time, but such a thin and aging old man is in the face of such a strong dark atmosphere. The breath that annihilates all vitality seems to be the water in front of the fish in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Shante, how do you think of this place?" Another old man appeared on the edge of the platform. This old man does not look very old, his robes are very neat, and the spirit gives a feeling that this person can be sober at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher did not answer, still silently watching the black mist on the altar. After a long while, he slowly asked: "Stephen, how many times have you not come here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About twenty years. Since the mountains Drew broke the hilt and I looked at it once.” Stephen thought and answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shante said faintly: "I have not come up for more than 50 years. Since I came here more than 50 years ago, I have accepted the brand of the Dark Star to die. After the Master of the Spirit Master, I never looked at it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did the teacher come here today?" Stephen asked, he also found this The words and voices of the old man seem to be somewhat different from each other. "Your body..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The kid helped me to heal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That kid..." First, a slight glimpse, then the color of surprise passed over Stephen's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's that..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. I learned the death magic with Sandru. Vadene always wanted to pull the kid who came to the guild. Not long ago, the kid came to me. It was Ai Grenair who directed him to come. He wanted him to go. The president can only go the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color of surprise on Stephen's face is heavier. Since Shante has left the gate of the guardian, it means that he really passed. "Oh? Then... did you really let him in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The kid picked up the hilt of the Dark Star in front of me." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no expression on Shante’s face, the voice is very light, and it seems like the pile of ashes is blowing in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephan still heard it clearly, but this time his face was no longer surprised, just staying sighed, then sighed and looked at the center of the altar A group of black fog did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of everyone else, it’s just a dark mist, and in their eyes, as a dead spirit accepted by the Dark Star, they can watch It is very clear that the group in the middle of the fog is a dark sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black. It is black. There are no adjectives other than black accidents that can describe this sword. This is a sword that condenses all the darkness of all the blacks in the world. It’s just that this sword does not have a hilt now, but the blade is solitary on the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
