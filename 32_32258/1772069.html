			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloogan is not called ‘Berugan’ and is called ‘adult’, but his name is called Bolugan. He seems to be born with this material. In the past, Bracada was just a small station on the border and had been a large-scale town under his administration for several years. He also became a town manager from a small official who was almost as big as a cashmere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brugan is annoyed now. He was sitting on the big chair with his hands on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief’s disguised caravan has been out for a month. The adults of Porugan stood in front of the checkpoint and watched them look at the appearance of Asa and Otaru dressed as businessmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brakada has to travel west for about 20 days to reach the western country through the wild highlands, but this is only the narrowest section of the southern tip of the highlands. . There is a large tract of land surrounded by the northern lizard swamp and the Sandefes. It’s just that there are no resources and vestiges worth exploring. There is a wasteland scattered with trees and hills and beasts. After a few years ago, the army of the Empire swept the orc tribes and basically no one had ever been involved. If the orc really wants to build a city-state, then the biggest possibility is there. In terms of time, they should have arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the situation there? Is it really a more rational country? So what kind of attitude will the orcs have to the empire that has been sweeping them all the time? He hopes that Asa will be able to come back soon. Although it is unlikely, the news that I hope to bring back will turn a corner for the upcoming war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corridors are coming to the footsteps. There should be several people who can only hear the sound of a footstep because someone is yelling. This voice only covers all the footsteps in my own prestige atmosphere. The pace is very loud and it is a very heavy and steady muffled sound from the footsteps that can be heard by the huge physique and momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloogan adults sighed and they should come back just because they didn’t expect it to be so fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was pushed open or the two doors that had been knocked open just turned on and immediately hit a huge body on the wall. It appeared in the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone doesn't know how to write the word WITTMANN, just look at this person and you will immediately become unsuccessful. This person seems to be transformed from the concept of ‘powerful’ to the top of the head to the heel and every part is full of the mighty and fierce momentum of the military soldiers. A golden head overflowed from the helmet and mixed with the same golden beard. The traces of the vicissitudes of the face and the knives were mixed together and it was difficult to separate each other as if it were a war rather than a time to remind the person. Taller than the average person, a large body with a shoulder wide and a shoulder wearing a modified steel armor only protects the important parts of the body from completely exposed rock-like muscles. There are two double-edged axe that are difficult to carry on the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adults of Bolugan waved to the people who followed several city halls to let them go out. The man was slamming in and they didn't stop. Bolugan stood up and nodded and said, "Hello General Sanders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not good." General Sanders stared straight at Bolu Dry adults. "I rushed over from the southern border of two thousand miles and killed ten fast horses. It was very tired and I was very upset so I was not good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where are your troops? Do you want to take a break first?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general looks really tired but even the tired lion is full of domineering and arrogant. "I have told you: I am not good. It means that you don't want to talk about those nonsense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polugan nodded from him ten years ago When I started to take over the post here, I was always in a position to deal with the generals who were not very good at playing. I was familiar with the general's temper. Under this circumstance, it is best to do what he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know why I am so anxious to come over?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't know."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I heard some strange rumors about the wild land in the west, I heard that there is a city-state in which an orc is being built."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know that the captain Sanders of the Paladins recruited mercenaries in your city six months ago?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then do you know why he is going to recruit mercenaries?" The general kept asking every question he said, his voice was even lower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." Polupan seems to only say these words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you heard about any news of him and his troops later?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No?" The general's two flame-shaped eyebrows burned a sound in the middle like a beast humming. "So, do you know what the troops are doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "That was the head of the Paladin and I secretly appointed him to go to the wasteland in the west to investigate the movements of the orcs. But I did not receive any of them in the past six months. Now I heard that the orcs have been established on the high ground. A city-state." The general's voice sounded like a lion roaring. "In the last letter I received, I only said that you refused to lend your soldiers to him and he had to recruit mercenaries here. And such a group disappeared around your town and you didn't know anything. The general stared at the face of Bolugan’s adult and asked a word. "You explain to me what is going on here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greats of Bolugan took a deep breath and explained it slowly and orderly: "Sands Chief Didn't tell me what he was going to do. He just wanted me to give him the escort in the city but he didn't have the relevant documents so I didn't hand him the troops. He brought the soldiers and recruited him. The army gathered together and they entered the depths of the wild highlands. It was too far away and there was no connection with us. I thought that they later returned to the empire from other places, so they didn't care. As for the orc who established the city, I did. I heard that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general stared at the Bolugans for a moment and asked: "Because there is no such instrument, you will not give the troops to him." You should know that the rank of the Paladin team leader is much higher than you and what is more important than the military mission that is safe for the country?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Porugan The adult said: "No matter what task he said to perform. The formalities are only private requests. I can't just hand over the troops to others because of the height of the official position. I have to maintain the local law and order. I am the local official of this town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bang of the axe that was still hanging on the waist of the general has been slammed on the desk and the table made of good wood has collapsed. "You are a fart!" The general seemed to use his voice to tear the dwarf in front of him. "If we are not on the front line, we are the ones who are playing with the power of the dog officers. The people on the borders of these soldiers will not be able to go smoothly to the western business roads without the invaders of the orcs." Do you know that the glory and wealth of these people are exchanged for the lives of our soldiers? But it is because these dog officers who only know the power to obstruct me will be tied to the damn south and cannot come to him. Instead of recruiting some mercenaries to scout the results, but for half a year, the orcs will not establish a city-state next to our empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The axe is just cut The center of the desk is smashed, but the entire table is smashed at the bottom of the table. It seems that this is just the arrangement of the flour. Bolugan looked at the axe in front of his nose. As soon as the point of the thing moved forward and moved a foot, he mixed it with the wood chips on the ground. The sweat had already flowed along the chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general stared at him murderous and grief in his eyes and turned and finally returned to the depths of the blind. He slowly retracted his axe and hung it back to his waist. He took a piece of official document from his arms and threw it on the face of Bolugan. "This is the official document you want. Now the empire has begun to enter the front line of the war. All the affairs are handled by me. The trade with the West immediately interrupts the use of Bracada as a military stronghold. You are no longer the governor of this town." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The special envoy of the Duke of Mulak has gone to the city-state to inquire about the news. If they bring back the news, they may not have to go to war." Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I never repeat my order." The general's eyes were shaking and his patience had reached its limit. "The last time I told you that I was in a bad mood. I was going to roll."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general still stood in the middle of the house like a statue of a stone. In the corridor, the footsteps of the adults of Bolugan became more and more distant and then he heard the voice of other staff members of the city hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general walked slowly into the chair and sat down to bury his face in his hands. Long-distance travel and large fluctuations in emotions made him seem to be ten years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything started today when the emperor changed his prime to the prime minister. After the new emperor ascended the throne, it was said that the West had already decided not to send another army to station. The southern countries were eager to move all the troops to the south. Because there is no border with other countries, there is no need to leave troops. The escort will be fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he received this order, he knew that this was the meaning of the new prime minister. Many of their families have long been coveted by the road to the Western countries. They have been indifferent to each other and often have a strict investigation of their caravans. Of course they will not let themselves continue to guard there. . However, it does not matter that he has always been not interested in politics. Since the sacred purpose is to transfer the army to the south, he will do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The son of the captain of the Paladin in the Holy Knights six months ago brought a secret letter from the head of Roland, saying that there is an orc in the wilderness of the western border. The activity asked him to investigate. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But because of the deterioration of relations with several countries in the South, there is a possibility that the war court will have an order not to allow any troops to be removed. He wrote to the court several times to ask for additional funds to allocate troops to the West. There is no echo in it. Needless to say, some people are making ghosts, which makes him hate those politicians. But no matter how the fire is, he is a soldier who can't move without a command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paladin is the most elite of the empire. Only through the simultaneous consent of both the emperor and the church can it be dispatched. Therefore, the head of Roland can only send people to investigate in private, but not even those who are inspected have no sound training. They can’t find out what the result is. After all, it’s too big and too big and too dangerous. There must be a considerable number of troops to really implement. Comprehensive reconnaissance. The pilgrim with the Erni family in the middle of the DPRK has been trying to get the army, so he has been working hard on political hand to deal with military leaders like him and Roland. The news of the orc is only that Roland has learned from the path that there is no basis. If they arbitrarily mobilize the troops to open the matter, it is easy for the ticket holder to grasp the handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he did not believe in the actions of the orcs who had been killed by him, he also knew that Roland was not a big man. So he quietly transferred some soldiers from his own troops to take his son to the west to pick up some local troops to scout. However, this trip is actually like a stone sinking in the sea for half a year. He was naturally responsible for guarding the frontiers. He naturally did not dare to leave his job. He constantly tried to find out and had no results. Finally, Roland finally got the exact evidence and reported it to the court. Then a paper of the apostasy said that the orcs in the Western Highlands had established a The city-state wanted him to go to the West immediately after the troops were transferred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he received the news, he knew that his son had died in the hands of the orcs. That was his youngest and last son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the orcs will be killed no matter what the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the testimony that he had sweared more than twenty years ago that he had meditation on the gods to make this oath. He didn't ask for anything this time. He thought that even the devil would be an assistant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news of the war was like a torrential rain in midsummer, and it was covered in the head of the residents of Bracada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But people quickly adapted from shock and incredulity and began to pack things away from this place. The short stay in this place for a few years is not enough to give them a feeling of remembrance. It was only three days that the original prosperity scene disappeared from the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloogan adults stood on the corner of the street and watched people leave the bag with their bags. This is the last group of residents to leave. The gates of the pubs everywhere were open and empty, leaving some tables and chairs and furniture and the windows of the room on the garbage floor being blown by the wind and swaying occasionally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first troops have reached the sword and the spear armor shines everywhere and the fatigue of the army is not able to conceal the hustle and bustle of this man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it going to fight?" Drilled a man in a robe from the corner of several houses and walked to the street next to the Polugans. Asked on the light. “When I first came here a few days ago, I saw that I was going to fight.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
