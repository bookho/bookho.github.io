			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tamik Knight did not take the thing that Asa threw out, and the breath of the thing was filled with the breath of the whole forest. Recognize the direction, and just on the way to send the magic array, but it seems to be instinctive disgust, and also consider whether he is capable of picking up the kind of thing that can be exhaled by himself. The Tamek Knight runs straight to the direction. Transfer the magic array. Billion has not forgotten that the Pope’s command is the leaf of the world tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange noises coming from behind and the slight trembles on the ground, Tamik Knight knows that this is definitely the body of Asa that drives the war. . However, it seems that the speed of the sound is not fast, and the Tamik Knight can have enough time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the Tamik Knight has returned to the vicinity of the transfer magic circle. He has seen a huge iceberg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most central is the unmovable female elf, surrounded by the green light of the world tree leaves around her body. The distance from the sound behind him was still a little far away, enough for him to take out the leaves of the world tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neighborhood is very quiet, and I don’t see Talis and my own figure. The elf captives are still totally unconscious. There seems to be no change here. Only the body of the kid named Abin was still lying there quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the Tali line killing the Templar, or is the Templar killed Talis? Can't it be the same? Why are you missing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound behind is close, the Tamik Knight has no time to explore the details, he leaps high by the momentum of the front, The long fangs of the fangs made a scream, and the black knives skyrocketed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowly, the Tammy Knight’s deep and indifferent, such as the autumn wind and autumn water, completely turned into a wild storm, and the black knife is no longer The rapid and silent electricity, but the power of infinity is the mine that can destroy the earth. To get rid of this magical ice does not require very high skills, just need to go all out to hit hard. He raised his knife and kneel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a loud noise, and the entire forest shook. The black thunder is on top of this huge iceberg. Numerous large and small pieces of ice were flying, and a huge crack used to wear the iceberg from top to bottom. Just a second blow, you can break it and take out the leaf of the world tree inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the Tamik Knight has not had time to make such a final blow, he did not expect that he would have been ambushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When being attacked, he was on the verge of a full blow. A sword light punctures out from the shadow of a big tree, like a silent lightning bolting into his vest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the sound of this sword is not big, but the Tamik Knight is still aware, after all, the level of the person who stabbed this sword has not reached his kind You can put the murderousness to the point where it is fully converged when you start the game. Even in the moment before the sword is released, there is already a murderous leak. However, at this time, the Tamika Knights had gathered all the vindictiveness and strength of the knife, and he even found out that there was no way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Tamik Knight did not investigate too carefully, this person was able to reveal his presence at the time of the shot, indicating that the hidden lurking is already Very good. And the better is the timing of this shot, even if the Tamik Knight found it. This has just released all the vindictiveness and strength of the body can no longer go to parry, he only had time to reluctantly turn to take a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight has no more unnecessary drink this time, her eyes are red, and the light is completely filled with the anger of revenge and the bloodthirsty violent It is more like a cultist who believes in demons than a knight who serves the light. But her hand is extremely stable. Jianguang is also concise and sharp. The timing of this sword's stability is just right. The perfection of a mainland warrior's first disciple is revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without grudges, the gray magical leather armor is completely unable to withstand the long sword that shimmers white magic and grudges. The long sword pierced the chest from the front heart of the Knights of Tamik as unimpeded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamik Knight spurted a large mouthful of blood. The blood splatters into the ice and instantly condenses into a red crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I die? How could you die in the hands of this idiot woman? How could she sneak attack? What does she believe in the Knights? How could she have such patience and heart calculations to count herself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think you will wait here to attack me..." Tamik Knight turned hard and looked at the knight standing in front of him. His dull face is unbelievable. He didn't know that Talis might have been the only enemy. He just didn't think of such an impulsive temptation. The sense of justice seems to have filled his mind into a woody person who can make such an effective sneak attack and assassination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that even if I catch up with you, the commission may have already been made. I am not very useful. But whether you win or lose, you must I am going back here, so I am waiting here. I am not your opponent in frontal battle, of course I only have a sneak attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis is coldly Looking at the predecessors who fell to the ground, the face and voice are as strong and arduous. "I also know that this opportunity is not very big, but it is already the biggest opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surprise on the face of Tamik Knight did not decrease. Lancelot is indeed a genius of martial arts, genius, these assassinations and hidden secrets he is also proficient, and also taught his only disciple, these judgments on the battlefield must be clear to every knight. But knowing, being clear and using it is totally different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becoming a choice and decision or to take action, all need is enough inner strength, otherwise they will only be lost by their own impulses. Not long ago, this childish impulse was ridiculous in a woman, and she was able to make such a rational judgment. The timing of the assassination was also a veteran who had grasped for many years. The Tamek Knight was really skeptical. What made her have Such consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What you have done is not qualified enough to be a Knight of the Temple. This is to judge you by justice."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the words of Talis, there was a sneer in the face of Tamik’s knight. He spoke, and the blood spilled out of his mouth, and he tried to spit out a word from the blood. "Then please tell the Pope to everything that happened here today. Remember to bring the leaves of the world tree and a good boy. I want to be, he is the biggest justice in the mainland..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound and the thought fade out together, and the fear of the most natural source of life, just like the little thing that was thrown out by Asa, is full of consciousness. And too. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original murder is such a feeling...Tamik Knight finally flashed such a thought in his mind, head down and fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis looked at Tamik’s body, and his last sentence made his original perseverance look a little distracted and flustered. When she just put down the body of Abin, and set off to catch up with Tamik and Asa, she felt the strange darkness of the night in the forest. She understood that this should be in Asa. The thing on the body has been taken out. She vaguely saw the small parcel of the Asa collection. Later, when the Tamik Knight tortured the elf, she knew that the thing in the parcel was Asa from the King of Einfast. Bring out, always collect things, and most of them are the things that give off that huge breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa was just a slap in the shadow of the Tamika Knight, she saw it very clearly, she understood that Asa is already an absolute disadvantage. Now that such a thing that he has personally collected is taken out, the meaning of the representative is very simple and clear. That is, he is also dead like Yabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dead, no longer. Just after the death of Abin, the stunned consciousness has once again hit a heavier impact. Suddenly countless pictures flew in her mind, Abin’s, Asa’s, their own, blended together, broken Cracked, flesh and blood, and died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge, unbelievable grief and anger suddenly used to wear Talis’s whole body, she could almost hear her soul in this power Under the impact of the shock is the wailing, deformation. The concepts of justice and light, which have always supported her feelings and the world of faith, have not played a role. In the face of this huge feeling, the collapse and disappearance disappeared, and she trembled all over her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to kill him, I want to kill him, I, sure, kill him! Talis could hear that her voice was not screaming in her own heart. Hey, she also opened her mouth, but she couldn’t make any screams, only tears fell down on big and big. And she feels that her expression is not crying, but rather almost madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
