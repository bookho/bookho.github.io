			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give you thirty seconds of cast time to show me the art of casting the so-called human caster."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mollier looked at the lich's eyes not as if looking at the ants but originally looking at the ants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, this is what you said." The laughter of the Lich is even harder to listen to ten times. The Necromancers behind her quickly spread their positions and began to recite the curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a time when the duel is more suitable for a duel and occasions, not to mention the conditions for playing with children. Lancelot and Rolander wanted to go up and stop persuading Moriel but they didn't dare to feel that they were just a fist, whether they were persuading or arbitrarily. All they can do now is to retreat into the remaining coalition forces and lead others back together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mollier can be despised by others who can despise or say that others must not despise. These are the top master-level magicians and even any one of them can use the magic of thirty seconds to turn the rest of the coalition into ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spells of several other Necromancers sang each other in a strange rhythm like the background music for the main melody. The main melody is that the lich is hard to hear. Not like the sound of sound. The sorrowful sound of the broken smashed and broken smashed from Ved Nina’s mouth continued to sing her like a singer who sings in love and sings her arms to face the darkest darkness of the group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strange and ugly mantra ensemble keeps rolling in the air and the black vortex whirls and resonates with each other and then returns to the ugly ugly horror song. On her body, she gradually condensed the darkness of the darkness that is almost indistinguishable from the position of the king of the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the same as the king of the Necromancer. This black is not only black but can't be blackened and swallowed everything. It also seems to be a living demon rising and agitating and turning into a huge black ball hanging over the heads of Morrill and Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless undead bones that have been scattered on the ground have re-bounced at this time and overlapped like countless ants, melting like a wax and then re-condensing. It’s just that the re-condensed bones are a lot smaller. The remnants of the dead spirits that have been swept by Gru have all re-condensed, but they have only gathered more than a dozen huge dragons. But if you look closely, you can see that the body of these dragons is no longer a bone, but a crystal-like jade, but it is a sacred body. This is no longer a dragon but a further dragon of ghosts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen ghosts of dragons are flying up and around the dark black ball slowly falling. Although slow, all the space under the ball has been covered by this sphere. The figures of Moriel and Gru seem to be only two insignificant points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How about this song of the Necromancer? I know that all the magic nowadays probably won’t help you. I am not interested in using the current magic system to go with an ancient giant. Longbi spells dragon magic. But don't you forget that we are all the kings of the dead spirit? The power of the thirty seconds of the song of the dead soul has summoned the power of the king of the dead. A sinister dragon is not inferior to the power of life. Even if you used to be the strongest of the Black Dragons, can you still compete with the great dark stars..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The black and black spheres around the body echo the lich as the ambassador of this black world. But her pride has only lasted for a few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two shivering sounds in the two earth-shattering sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Grou’s long whistle is already a huge unbreakable weapon, it seems that the darkness is torn apart. The sound of Morrill is a boiling explosion. The sea that is raging in the sky has drowned everything here. There was no light around Moriel's body, but it looked more dazzling than the gleaming Gru. Her body was so small, but this rush seemed to sag all over the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Gru's shouting is like an invincible sword, Moriel's voice is an endless and unstoppable sea that is boiling and exploding. This sharp sharpness is a grandiose and unparalleled mutual complement each other. It is completely compatible with each other. It seems that these two figures are originally one. The huge black in the bang was actually shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most shocking thing for the lich is not the loud noise but the smashing of the black ball. The tiny body of Moriel rushed into the darkness that seemed to devour everything, and the darkness shattered silently. Several masters can be said that the joint curse used by the great master's magician was actually broken by this person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shock is not just the spirit of several Necromancers, including Vedena, shaking at the same time and then slowly collapsed. Vad Nina's lich body is like a piece of biscuit that has been stepped on and shattered. The same is true of several other Necromancers. This is the reversal of the Dark Star. Their consciousness and body have long been associated with the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the darkness between the blink of an eye and the ghostly dragon are all smashed and the pieces are not left behind. Only two figures landed slowly from midair. Gru's vindictive light is already weak. Many of Moriel still have no light on them, but they are still more dazzling than anything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your body has fully recovered?" Gru looked at Molier and asked. It’s not easy to crush all these ghosts on his body. But in any case, even if it is an ancient dragon, it seems that he is still so strong and invincible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah. There are no such good feelings for tens of thousands of years." Moriel's laughter rolled back in the darkness. "It took these days that the two necromancers finally managed to succeed in the last half of the real meditation. The two men used their lives to unlock the seal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean that both people...?" Vidnina's voice came and gone from her broken body. Only the body that she collapsed can slowly condense several other necromancers that have become the dust of the land. Even if they are the servants of the Necromancer, they can't stand it. If it isn't the Lich's soul, there is a sense of self-awareness. There is a master's standard. She can only be like them now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not guess the purpose of Sandro’s departure but she did not catch up. First, she really did not have the confidence to deal with both Sandru and Ai Ruiruil in the case of leaving Deva. The second is that she understands that even if Sander really can give up the seal, the seal is really not completely relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seal is needed to completely practice the real meditation of the person to crack but Sandro or any of the Necromancers did not put the real meditation Practice is over. And the life of Moriel in the seal has already been spent almost so she is not too worried. But now it seems that the black dragon princess's physical and stateful fighting power seems to be better than when he faced Akibad five hundred years ago. It wasn't until this time that she knew that it was not only Sandro but also Agriel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are two very interesting people for two people. Half a day ago, the two of them together condensed more than ten real meditations on my seal magic array. All the magic and vitality of the sky collided with each other and finally broke the ball of the seal made by Chen Kibad with my blood and soul. It is the complete crack that all the forces are returned to me. And I have been nursed for so many years, I want to be now. The power is enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you take them to experiment. How much difference do you have to try and the strength of that guy?" Gru asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Moriel sighed. Looking at the darkest black head of the group, he sighed. Her flaming long-slung stunned look even though it was a shameful look. "Unfortunately, I am too disappointed. As I have felt before, such a guy can actually become the king of the dead. It is simply an insult to this artifact."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It is impossible, but the power of the great King of the Necromancer, no matter how powerful you are, cannot compete with this power.” Vadina was lying on the ground and wailing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid. Can't you feel it? The power of this dark star is too weak. I already had it when the hilt was picked up. It feels like the whole big 6 veins have been shrouded in this dark breath as the Elven King picked up the Dark Star. But it seems that the size of the force is too far because the carrier is too weak. It's like a cub just born. It's not a good idea. It's more suitable for a guy who doesn't even save himself. What do you want to know about the king of the dead? You know that the elf king at that time is not dark. The power of the stars is not under me. The difference between the power of the nibble holding the black-skinned hilt is like an elephant and an ant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Unfortunately, I was not able to do anything at the time. The seal and the wounds of the last battle have made me unable to bear. I originally thought that I was only waiting quietly in the underground to confess and Chen Jibad’s agreement. I can’t do it, but I don’t think about it. At this time, there will be a Necromancer to unlock the seal and come to the two acting presidents. They should have been the servants of the king of the dead, and the half-dead will never exist but use them. The life is to wake me up." Moriel sighed with a long sigh. "They have taught me these things over the past few days. Apart from Akibad, these monkeys are not useless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
