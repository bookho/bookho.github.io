			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the discussion of the ministers, they gradually began to unite in the direction of wishing to trade with Oufu. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several finance ministers who have roughly calculated the possible losses of the war with Oufu and the benefits of accepting the conditions of Oufu and continuing to trade. Comparing this loss and loss to each other is immediately a small commotion. The eyes of several ministers are all the golden light of Huang Chengcheng. If it weren't for Her Majesty and the bishops who were still sitting on it, I am afraid they will soon be unable to sign a permanent peace treaty with Oufu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Catherine listened quietly to the discussions of the ministers. Then turned to look at the face of the Chamber of Commerce, still with the smile of the person asked: "Luther Chamber of Commerce. You should be the most familiar with the orcs in Europe, I want to hear your opinion. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Ma Rongrong." The chairman of the Chamber of Commerce took a step forward. This is the purpose of his coming here. The thousand gold coins of Cedros are of course beautiful, but further, the biggest loss after the trade with Oufu is the Chamber of Commerce of Erasia. Since Oufu has already opened the door with a big stroke, the messenger seems to be a waste. Then the next step is to rely on his own efforts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Her Majesty is now taking the initiative to ask and he is not sure how to find an opportunity to speak. If you can really restore the relationship between the two countries by yourself, it will be a step in the way. The Chamber of Commerce said with a sincere spirit in a sincere tone: "The grassroots can use the head to guarantee that the recent births will not be the responsibility of Oufu."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" The Queen’s brows looked a curiosity. "What do you say is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude of Her Majesty’s wife made the voice of the Chamber of Commerce more powerful. He said: "No matter how Oufu first There is no motive for taking the initiative to do these things. The original sinister and unpretentious highland since the establishment of Oufu has now become a broad road for merchants to gather. Oufu also relies on these to be able to reach the scale of today and the economy of Oufucheng is almost entirely dependent on Trade to maintain. The relationship with the countries around the Highlands is especially important for such a city. Even a slightly minded person knows that they will never be willing to take the initiative to deal with the country." The Chamber of Commerce looked around The ministers around. "The adults who know the country's politics at a high level must be more clear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The biggest doubts of the adults are that the nature of the orcs is difficult. Occasionally, the animal will be so great that they will do things that hurt the world. But the grass people and the Lord of the City of Oufu, Mr. Cedros, have long known each other and the name of Mr. Cedros is probably unknown. It’s obvious that since the saga can lead the orcs to build a city of this size out of thin wilderness, can the orcs under their control be bad? As for the orcs who have been to Oufu, they know that they are actually It's not much different from ordinary people. Even if a wild beast like a wolf is domesticated into a dog, it can be completely safe with humans. Why don't we believe that those who are closer to the wolf than we can communicate with us in language? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The adults also know that the loss of our chambers during the various tragedies that occurred during this time was the biggest. There are more than a dozen merchants who have died under the fangs of the mad orcs. The appeasement of the family members to redeploy the loss of the manpower goods, etc., all of us have a headache. And there are two or three grassroots who have died for decades. Friend...." Luther Chamber of Commerce found two drops of old tears under the eyes to properly use it at this time. But he immediately turned grief and indignation into strength and raised his voice. "But despite this, the grass-roots still insist on calming the hearts of the people in the Chamber of Commerce to keep everyone's confidence in Oufu. Now, when you ask the grass-roots people, the grass-roots will be daring to talk about the other reasons behind the tragedy that happened some time ago. The adults do not need to push the responsibility to Oufu first. You must not interrupt the trade with Oufu because of the waste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncertain the attention of Her Majesty the Queen and the Ministers The force has always been on the body of the Chamber of Commerce and has more and more confidence. The expressions are getting more and more vivid, and the sounds are getting more and more stunned and more and more convincing. I have fully demonstrated the professional eloquence that I have accumulated in my life. "Please sire and the adults believe that the vision of an old businessman who has been raging in the past few decades has indeed been trustworthy. But the most important grass people think that the figures are more convincing. Fighting with Oufu and with Oufu The gains and losses between the two trades have just been calculated by the adults. You must be more impressed by the people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many ministers nodded in agreement The atmosphere has taken a step closer to the direction that the president of the Chamber of Commerce hopes. The old president of the Chamber of Commerce actually had a blush that only young people had. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president of the Chamber of Commerce has made a completely restorative expression and movement. "I don't want everyone. I went there when I was in the grass. When I was there, there was no such thing as a house. So at night I was sleeping in a cave with two werewolves and an ogre. Know that the orcs are not talking at the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you not afraid at all?" The minister continued to ask in surprise. "Know that the ogre, a monster that attacks the village to hunt people for food when food is scarce."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president of the business thought about it and bowed his head and sighed "In fact, I still have a little worry, so I didn't sleep well at night. But I am not worried about being killed and eaten...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you What are you worried about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president of the business wrinkled his face with a dilemma. "No....I am worried....It’s not convenient to say..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several ministers frowned and asked: "What are you worried about? But it doesn't matter. Let Let's take a look at the meaning of the orcs who are invited by the Queen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of the Chamber of Commerce said with a red face: "Because the cannibal next to me The devil is a female and she doesn't wear any clothes....so I am worried...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'噗哧' Ministers are desperately trying to laugh a few I got a red face. A military minister bowed his head and said to his peers: "It turns out that he is not afraid of being eaten and is afraid of being forced to eat. If he really eats that... this old man is probably the first person in ancient and modern times."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know if he can eat it and watch the old man's fear of being afraid of falling into the drowning..." The whisper responded. Then the two laughed and blushed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laughter around him is still the same as when he first came in, but the heart of the Chamber of Commerce is already a paradise for heaven. He feels that he seems to be only one step away from success. Of course, on the surface he is still embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appropriate clown is a good means of communication when appropriate. People are often more accustomed to people who are not ridiculous. It is easier to accept that person and his opinions and opinions. The president of the business is very satisfied with his superb performance. He couldn't help but turn his head and glanced at the heart of Bolugan, who had been stupidly standing next to him. It is also the meaning of the clown and the dwarf that are completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female officer next to Queen Catherine seems to think that this statement is a bit awkward and means that I want to swear. But the Queen gently raised her hand. The female officer retired.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen sat on the throne and looked at the ministers and chambers of commerce underneath with kindness and majesty. There is also a smile on her face, but it is completely different from the self-satisfied expression of the people below. It was a kind of gaze that looked like a hostess looking at a group of pets. Although kind and friendly, it is definitely not on the same level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning of the Chamber of Commerce, the Queen has never spoken or spoken. She didn't seem to be in a hurry and didn't seem to care about what they were talking about but what other things were waiting for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord said. The greed for money is evil." A voice sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sudden sound is heavy and solemnly echoing in the space of the main hall, like a background note with incomparable power, instantly condensing the relaxed atmosphere in the hall. . All the sneer and whispers disappeared immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Esser, who has not spoken or expressed his attitude, has finally spoken. The expressions and moods of all the ministers immediately sank down not only with the status of the adult master and the meaning of this sentence as if the voice itself contained the power of the monk. As if he had opened the air here, it was filled with dignified and solemn taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The innocent believers killed by the orcs, how many gold coins are their lives? How many gold coins are the statues of the desecrated Lord? The sacred priesthood How many gold coins are the people worth?" The voice of the bishop is not high, but the power is becoming more and more grand and even makes people feel impulsive. "And how many gold coins are there in the words of the Pope? Do you have a gold coin price for your faith in God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
