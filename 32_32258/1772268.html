			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slang on the edge of the sorcerer from the Tower of the Tooth is still hesitating on the edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are almost no fighting ideas for them. Although many people are resentful of stabbing the grandeur of the Granden Tower, they never thought about it. Directly rushing in to kill each other and take advantage of them. They are not robbers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The momentum is rushing to the original, just want to rely on the lineup of hundreds of senior magicians to scare the other side to force the elves to apologize and surrender the healable It’s just the thing that is the main character of the tower. So when they saw that Master Eden was directly from a high altitude, it was a legendary singular singularity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But immediately they were even more surprised that this was enough to destroy an army's *though the leaves of the forest did not blow up. Only a few * divisions can feel the magical power of the forest in the forest weakened. Then a thunderous bomb from Master Eden finally provoked screams and wail in the depths of the forest. It’s just a little strange that another thunder bomb is falling in the forest not far from them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do? How does Master Eden get started directly? Are we going up too?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp What is the Lord Adenta doing? At the beginning, do you want to use these * skills to flatten the forests of these elves? What is the magic shield? Even the stars can be resisted? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, don't panic for the time being. "Speaking is a fire department* dressed in a red robe. He looked at the air magician floating above the woods with some doubts and looked at the forest again. "I think we should talk to the elves first." Just now. Although I have not been in contact with the elves, they should be a calm and elegant race..." He touched his large white beard and said it was peculiar to the elderly. "Or we will send someone first... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the 'houting' of this fire department*'s upper body suddenly disappeared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; From the waist above the teacher's chest to the heavy face, the snowy white beard stroking the beard's hand and the second half of the words are all gone. Only the flesh and blood fragments of the sky splashed onto the surrounding magician. The half waist still stands After a while, some blood was splattered and it fell softly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body with two tall qi elements behind him also opened a big and big The holes are so big that even the magic structures are completely collapsed. The unique self-repair of the gas elements cannot be carried out and then the two cloud-shaped giants dissipate.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Oga! "The surrounding magicians screamed in unison and were completely stunned by this eccentric scene.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone is careful. It seems to be an archer. "A mage who blessed the higher eagle eye saw that it was a green light from the forest that flashed silently and then everything under this green light track was broken. Although he could hardly believe that there was What archers can shoot two elements of giants with one arrow, but this is obviously not the destructive power of magic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These genie git. Everyone is going to add protective magic to themselves. "A wood-based teacher raised his hand and quickly swung a large piece of crystal ice wall and immediately appeared in front of all the magicians. The ice wall used by the professional water system is not only wide enough to cover everyone but also thick. Needless to say, it is a bow and arrow. I am afraid that even the warrior's heavy hammer is difficult to break.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green light is once again invisible to the naked eye from the forest. The water system that opened a round hole in the ice wall, the teacher, didn’t even slam a hole in the chest. The hole was so big that he almost took his body from the chest. It was split into two pieces. He looked at his already lost chest with an incredulous expression and fell to the ground.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same fall also stood in the same The other two magicians on the line, one half of the body, smashed into a scream of eccentricity. The twisted and fell to the ground. The other person’s luck was only wiped over the shoulders and arms. Half shoulder image It was bitten off by the beast. It fell to the ground because of the huge pain. The sound of the call made other magicians shudder.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that everything on this green light trail becomes as fragile as the virtual image of smoke. Everyone can see that no matter what kind of protective magic is under the attack, it is the paper under the gun.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice blasts thunder and blasting giant rock scattered area explosions... There are even two fire bombs and chain lightning. The crazy elements of magical fluctuations are filled with this area. The dozens of magicians here are the top elemental mage. The white thunder ball is stripped from the ground and flies out in the upper half of the air. The magical rock that explodes in the air condenses into a huge explosion of huge flames that burst into numerous magical ice thorns. The most destructive elemental magic Like a huge wave of colorful waves, rushing toward the forest in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explosive sound puncture sounds the sound of the flame rising, the sound of the sound of a hundred meters of woods between the eyes of the eye became a magical purgatory violent sea Everything that destroys everything in this space is smashed. The original thick trees were smashed by the electric coke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelene carrying the long black bow in her hand and crawling and slamming back and forth, back to the back is the piece that can pull hundreds of her to the smallest pieces Magic purgatory. Her luck is quite good. If it wasn't for a thundering bomb, the blast of the blast would just take her off the run. She could fly her into a coke after a huge amount of heat. Even so, her head was half-burned and almost burned. Her face was full of gray soil. The original appearance of the body was now a smashing escape from the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that two arrows can only shoot two arrows in a short time. This is the limit of her now vindictiveness. But shooting two arrows solved more than three * divisions and then saw the whole body and retired Kailin was very satisfied with her judgment. She can see that the target was the highest among these magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become first. There are also thieves who smash the king first These two are the fighting principles that she has always believed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few steps in the depths of the forest, I saw the other elf archers waiting in front. Kelly directed the elf archers to spread out and climb the dead wood guards gathered around. "Everyone is careful that these guys are all very high-level magicians. Don't approach them easily. Use the dead wood guards as a cover to take time and use the bow and arrow to shoot as much as possible to delay their progress and let Yangjing slowly recover."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than ten seconds, the purgatory magical storm finally dissipated the 100-meter radius of the place and even a piece of wood residue could not be left. If the destructive power of this small area alone is not even comparable to the curse of these dozens of high-level magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These idiots want their bloody debts to pay!" Looking at the bodies of the three disabled divisions on the ground, all the magicians have been completely irritated. These are not only in the tower of the tooth, but even on the big 6 is definitely one of the few top elemental magicians, but here they are inexplicably changed into bodies without even seeing the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A variety of elemental shields begin to flash on the magician's body with the spells of the various divisions* to summon the huge fire element earth element water Elements such as the various elements of the giant summoned out a circle of rigorous guards around the magicians to the vastness of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen the green light that even the ice wall can’t resist. No one would think that it’s a good way to take the air element. These elements* The giants that are summoned by themselves are also enough to level the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the top of the head of the gas element, Aiden’s head pours a bottle of extremely precious auxiliary healing power. The eyes closed slightly and meditated. Some of the magical power that is too much loss. Looking at the magical bombardment light below, he smiled with satisfaction and thought that the fire that had been thought to take some trouble could not be ignited so quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves in Tula have long been frightened by the attack of the church and the Necromancer, so they must fight back after their own shots, as long as this war is burning I am afraid that there is no water that can be extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Shusheng came to the forest below to fly dozens of white Pegasus figures. These rare creatures are spread out with a few meters of white giant wings and one or two elves on each wing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for death." Aiden showed a smile like a skate. Turning heads to the back of several gas system * said: "You have solved these guys as the core of our work. We joined forces and used the last star to fly down enough to flatten the bottom."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certain part of the forest on the ground is banging loudly with flames and heat waves rising from the sky and a forest of nearly 100 meters in a circle under the magic of magic. The strength of these dozens of divisions is not the resistance of the dead wood guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
