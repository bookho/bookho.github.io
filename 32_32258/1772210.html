			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, a large team of Griffin Knights left the camp of the army and took off to the northeast to go to the two strongest griffins and carried two Knights of the Temple. Flying far in the forefront. This gryphon army has nearly half of the remaining gryphon troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coalition forces last night did not receive the night attack that the Knights of the Temple were scrupulous, but the investigation team sent out was like a sinking sea and no body. These scouting soldiers are all one of the best in the field and have received the special training in the field of wild field reconnaissance and combat. But the results of this action prove that no matter how training humans are always unable to be as smart as beasts, especially people. Trained beasts are shoulder to shoulder. The orcs seem to be expanding as soon as they gain the advantage of the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time the orcs have achieved a seemingly insignificant advantage, but they have not alerted the soldiers of the coalition forces but have even aroused their fighting spirit. . The cautious practices of the Knights of the Temple have made them feel extremely impatient. This is one of the reasons why the two Knights of the Temple decided to attack in person. Any impulse and fighting spirit will become a problem if it is suppressed for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shines from the distant horizon and the golden light is filled with wasteland. In front of it is a large forest. This woodland is the most abundant place on the wild land. Although it is not as dense and dense as a tropical forest, it is flourishing. The Griffin troops are far from the coalition's brigade. Now there is no trace of blood and blood in the sun-filled wilderness. But the two Knights of the Temple did not dare to make the slightest impression that they knew that the murder was hidden in the dry air at any time. Although the dawn should be the most tired of flying the whole night, but the mentality of caution is already early. They have a brain in their heads. This is not excessive caution. But they know that it is necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sharp break in the air that suddenly pierced the quietness of the early morning wasteland. Two huge smashing arrows suddenly shot from the bottom of a forest, the target is the forefront. Two Knights of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Below?" Both Knights of the Temple are a glimpse. Welsh Kay with the naked eye to buckle the arrow and put on the gold bow on the hand to pull the string loose hand. In this short moment, an arrow was shot and the arrow below hit the arrow and collided and fell apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adriek’s hand is a huge gun with a length of five meters. Even the strongest griffin is very difficult to fly. But he is in his hands as if he is carrying a dead branch. This amazingly long gun was not used to attack but to defend him. He only shook his hand and shook his hand. The tip of the gun just picked it up on the flying arrow. The arrow that was originally enough to pierce the gryphon fell diagonally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Wyverns with the flying branches and leaves slamming from the woods, they did not want to attack the two solitary lions Instead, he nicknamed the whole east. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They have been hidden in the woods? It seems that they are not acting at night. It seems that these two-legged dragons are only aimed at the daytime griffin knight. Then kill it last night. The reconnaissance squad is the other orcs? It seems that perhaps the preparation for this attack is quite adequate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lizard's eyesight is very good should see us It’s not ordinary gryphon knights. And they should have been forced to touch us with the above commands.” Wellske slammed on an arrow and pulled a full bow with a white stalk with a sharp slap. Going through the air. His arrow, which was purely armed, was faster and more profitable than the arrow that the car shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wyvern is still more than a mile away from him and the head of this flying animal is not too big. If you look at it from the ordinary person's eyes Looking outside the place is not much bigger than the sesame seeds. But this arrow is going straight to the head of the Wyvern. impartial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foot of the Wyvern’s dragon suddenly jumped up in a dark and sharp figure. The dark piece seemed to be a shield. This figure just stopped in front of the head of the Wyvern's dragon, and the sound of a metal impact came from far away. The Wyvern was still flying in front of the Ming Dynasty. This arrow was actually blocked by this figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reaction and arm strength of the lizard is really good." Wellskey’s eyes jumped and jumped and took an arrow and shot it. This arrow is directed at the wings that the Wyvern is agitating and is not the flesh behind it. The lizard man is only on the back of the Wyvern. Even if you want to block it, you can't stop it, and the two-legged dragon that is broken by one wing is no different from the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the bang, the arrow was actually blocked. A lizard grabbed the tail of another lizard with a shield and smashed it out. The length of the two lizards was just enough to pick up the arrow that could not be stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wellskey didn't speak, but just took a deep breath of anger and flashed on him. He took the arrow and bowed again. This time his bow is no longer a pull or a loose, but slowly pulls the right arm that is already thick and somewhat disproportionate. It is even bigger and amazing. And the sculpture of the blood vessels like a granite sculpture until the whole golden bow was turned into a perfect arc, he suddenly let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the two arrows are all electric, then this arrow is the thundering roar of the white light wrapped in the white dragon. This arrow does not specifically target which part is the same as the power and the destructive power represented by this power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fierce scream of the two-legged dragon is only half-sounding in the flesh and blood. The huge body is almost divided by the arrow from the end. How to look at half a section is not like the visceral bone of the huge blood trough that is caused by the arrow. Muscles and spurted blood fill the surrounding space. This huge sky king was actually shot by an arrow and scattered like a pile of broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loud cheers and shouts burst out from the mouths of the gryphon knights behind them, killing such a huge monster with destructive power and still The distance beyond this is much more imaginary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Wellscai’s face is more heavy, not just because he shot the last arrow of the three arrows or hit the whole hand and hit a Wyvern. It was because he saw that all the figures above him and he were about to shoot when he and the arrow were about to shoot the Wyvern. This is undoubtedly the right choice because this arrow is not just aimed at the Wyvern. More aimed at the above orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any of the two flying dragons are invaluable weapons and wealth for Oufu, but this is only half the blink of an eye. Reasonable judgment knows that in any case, it can't stop such an earth-shattering arrow and immediately abandon the dragon to jump. This shows that it is not just the outstanding body and reaction that the orcs have. It is the mind and judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The height of the flying dragon is not too high. It is the height of the woods that is nearly 100 meters. It is not a problem for the lizards. Wellske looked at the figure that was hidden in the bushes and hesitated. Turning his head to Edric said: "This can't be just an ordinary orc. It seems to be an elite arrangement. How? Continue to chase it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Adriatic’s voice said: “Are you afraid that there is a trap waiting for us as Javier’s kid is saying?” The gryphon’s large army is behind us and then behind the tens of thousands of troops, even if it is a trap. We have no reason to retreat. And even if Gru personally came to me, I don't believe that we can't deal with it even if we can't deal with it. It’s not a problem to get away from the whole body. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilska didn't speak, just raised the gold giant bow in his hand and put an arrow on the other long-legged dragon.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost like the previous one, Wellske’s arrow was blocked by the orc on the Wyvern. Until he gathered his temper to come out The arrow that went to let the orcs above escape and fled the two-legged dragon. But the orcs on the two-legged dragon also seized this time and shot a lion's arrow. A gryphon knight was smashed into the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two consecutive arrows are such a slap in the face of the all-powerful blow. Wellskey is also slightly tired. At this time, Edric suddenly screamed: "Be careful. Sure enough. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the full force of Wellskey, the light is in no way inferior to the rushing from below. It is a spear. The surrounding white scent of light twitched the branches and leaves of the trees near the air spear track and was excited to burst into a green ripple in the sky. This spear is directed at Wellske.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sound of Adriek, the huge gun with five meters of work blocked the spear. The spear swung in an arc after the collision with the gun. The temperament of the Knights of the Temple is also fleeting. The vindictiveness of Edric is also permeated on the weapon. He is evenly divided: "Is it not Gru?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion's scream under the scream of Adriatic screamed down and turned down. The aftermath of this impact was just for the Knights of the Temple. It’s nothing, but the Griffin can’t stand it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “One or two squads followed my three-four squad to give welsh escorts. "Adriatic screamed and slammed the crumbling griffin in the air and added a feather drop to the woods. Since he felt that it was not Gru, it was necessary to take the initiative. As long as it was not Gru, he came to him." Believe that the two Knights of the Temple have absolute certainty to deal with any enemy of Oufu, and there are hundreds of Griffin Knights.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wellske frowned at the forest below and tried to find the figure that had just thrown a spear. From the point of the spear strength and vindictiveness, although it is certainly not Gru, it is still a rare strong opponent. Although he could not suddenly wake up from the dense foliage, he shouted to the gryphon knights who protected his surroundings. "All of them are scattered away from me and keep at least 50 meters apart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Griffin Knights are at a loss. But before they even had time to respond to the Order of the Knights of the Temple, a dazzling white ball of light in the forest below the tree had already flown toward the dense group of lions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a thundering bomb? Is it Cedros?" Wellscay licked his eyes and could see the jump on the ball of light. The electric light kept on, so he was surprised that he thought that the attack in this case must be the kind of green fireball containing the toxins of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilska lightningly pulls out a tiny crystal from the back and breaks the magic arrow and shoots it on the bow. This kind of advanced magic can't be considered for the Knights of the Temple. The moment when the crystal arrow hits the thunderball, it completely decomposes and cleans up this group of electro-optic light with great destructive power. And just the next moment, Wellske has already shot a shot to shoot the position of this thunderous bomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a flaming crystal arrow that just burst into the woods and burst into a fierce flame. Welsh Kay looked at the piece of magical flame that was blown out. On the hand, the golden giant bow has been full of strings and put on the arrow. He did not really see where the figure of the thunder bomb was released, but he used this flame burst arrow to force the person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the two figures fled in the flames. But Wellske was a glimpse because it was not the figure of Cedros that he expected, but two young people. One man and one woman and both of them are still full of white magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I took a shot of Willske’s arrow and shot it. Whether it is an orc or a person, no matter what magic they have, it is an enemy that appears and attacks at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This arrow is not the same as the one that shot the two-legged dragons, but it is still as fast as the power but the young man below A long sword can block this arrow. Although this person was also shocked by the tremendous power of this arrow, the sword was also released. But after all, it was blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Griffin Knights in the Middle East battle mage also out of the figure of these two people, suddenly dozens of fireballs, ice arrows and lightning are shooting at two. Because this distance is too far. There is also the ability of the combat mage to cast spells and the relationship between the full-time magicians can not accurately hit the target two people in this rain magic attack is awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilska saw the white magic of the two men’s hearts, and his eyes naturally showed that the strength of a man and a woman is still Far from being able to sneak out the high-order magic of thunderous bombs, there is no doubt that it is a reel. So ordered to the surrounding Griffin Knight: "Go to the living."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team of lions and knights heard the words immediately swarming down and the war mage also stopped. attack. Willske's eyes are really what he wants to see in the woods below. Unknowingly, there was a scent of corpse that was sent to the nose. Wellskai suddenly stunned and looked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a big black dot above the sky above it and this black dot is falling down with countless tiny black raindrops from the Temple Knight just noticed The black little has already landed on the top of the head and the stench has become extremely incomprehensible. This black rain curtain covers at least a few hundred meters of space, covering most of the Griffin knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mage Force Purification is used. Everyone is hiding in the woods and trying not to be drenched by the dead spirits." All the Griffin troops drunk him. It only needs to be able to tell from the smell that these black raindrops are what the black spots above the sky are all in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original attack that has been born in the woods is to attract everyone’s attention to the person’s rise from other places and then fly here to make opportunity. This is undoubtedly a very reasonable and ingenious trap not only to anticipate that they will take the initiative to deal with the two-legged flying dragons and will not hesitate to bring them to this place at the cost of two two-legged dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I still can’t see how the next trap will be, but at least Wellskey has now found a chance to be above such a high altitude. That is simply preparing a live target for him. He raised his bow and screamed: "Looking for death." The full force of the vindictive spirit has already left the string. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
