			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really not an emptiness. All the souls of all his souls have all the power of a knife that has broken into the other's body. He can clearly feel his strength and his spirit. How does his soul go to cut off the clavicle in this body? Cut the ribs and break the muscles and open the internal organs. The thorns are like a broken bamboo and then drawn from the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the destruction of the body, everything is smashed under this knife, and the gray armor of the body of the Necromancer is so strong that it is so strong. The muscles of the muscles are still so secretive and functional. It is like a frosty disintegration in front of his fighting scent and power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the knife but the fact that he himself condenses everything he has into an unprecedented condensed point and slashes into the body of the King of the Dead. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what strength, as long as it can be condensed to the highest is the strongest and clearest. Everything seems to be unstoppable in front of him in this unprecedented clearest and most cohesive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind this way? Asa knows that everything has been destroyed under all of this, no matter what the body is, it has been split into two. But Asa did not have the slightest excitement. Because the king of the dead spirit did not have any dodge and parry, so he stood still and waited for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the King of Necronomics suddenly reached out and shook hands with Asa’s hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a very strange touch, although it’s cold but not stiff and even softer. No hostility is like a friend's handshake. This touch not only stays on the skin but also extends into the deepest part of the body spirit. It is not the hand that feels like a soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you have been waiting for a long time, I know that you will come." Although the body of the King of the Dead has indeed been separated, it has indeed been destroyed. Asa can even clearly feel that the body of the King of the Dead is indeed 'dead' but there is a hollow voice that sounds directly in the depths of Asa's mind. "I also know that you will definitely do this. You must do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it you?" Asa was completely shocked. It’s not just the sound but also the myriad of image ideas. I don't know because this hand is still because he has condensed all the spirit and soul of his knife. His soul seems to be connected with the soul of the king of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Descartes Valley is desperately struggling... The hard choices and golden dreams of Wang Duzhong... put all beliefs and lives on the bet... dim The living anatomy in the hut... the bet transformation in the Glorious Castle and the seemingly summoned. It’s the darkest hilt that is the ultimate meaning of his life. It’s like the ultimate illusion of his life...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that the accumulated memories of these long pains have accumulated and accumulated together and their own thoughts spread and infect each other. Just in a blink of an eye. He can hardly tell who he is, whether he is going to die to destroy the dark star, or the young man who has been struggling but only deeper and deeper in darkness and despair. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just the thoughts and memories of Rhodes. More darker, more bloody, sharper, more intense, and the images and thoughts are coming in. It is not the kind of hollow hole from the Dark Star that seems to have other souls in this body. A fierce and violent cruelty is like an animal-like instinct that is filled with all the fierce and violent temperament of the world. But the animal nature of any animal can't have such a violent temper. The animal nature that is mutated in human nature is more than any animal nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another soul figure that is sharper, more lonely, and more distorted than Rhodehart in the infinitely struggling soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sense of the soul, Asa can see a lot of memories he is familiar with. This soul is so strong and hateful to him that he is so strong but biased. This life trajectory is inextricably intertwined. He even has a feeling that this is his other self. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is different from Rhode Hart that these two souls are not complete. This is the soul of two people who have indeed been 'dead'. It was too close to the movement of the Black Star to retain it with this body. The king of the Necromancer can be said to be Rhodehart and the integration of the three people's consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being abandoned, being angered, being killed, being abandoned, being used to be strong, unwilling to struggle, to take off everything, to win, to feel that the pain will no longer be compensated in the wailing of others, to be satisfied in the worship of others... and then to all of this Everything is handed over to others to let others repeat it... The dark bloody animal nature of the whole look is accumulated by countless other things. He clearly feels this dark and broken. Under the soul, all are struggling with loneliness and suffering when the environment is created by the distortion of the world by other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the birth of a person, crying and crying out the first sound, it is destined to smelt each other in the huge melting pot of the earth...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrow and despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the only emotion that remains in his own consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory of the four people are all glued together and entangled in countless messy pieces of separation and scattered only one feeling is getting clearer and clearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incapable of emptiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You may not feel it before but now you should know that we are here because of fate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still a hollow voice. But Asa now understands why the void is because the world is empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn’t matter anymore **It doesn’t matter if you lose everything, it’s so meaningless and it’s futile to end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel it to me." Asa replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can indeed feel the order in which he is now faintly aware of the whole world. It is a kind of thing that is all about the concept of all things. No good, no bad, no light, no darkness, a machine that is so vast and extremely precise, no emotion, no bias, no connection, no connection to the world, nothing to break away from the order of this bondage or that is the meaning of the world itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't understand it. This is originally a state that people can't understand. Just like an ant can't understand the operation of the stars and understand their position in the animal world. This is just a memory from the body of the Necromancer and this memory is only from the precipitation in the Dark Star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dark Star is originally the condensation of the world's breath. It naturally attracts the process of everything in the world. Before he was born or before Rodhart was born before his birth, Klauvis was destined to go to the present step, no matter what the process is already doomed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa didn’t just hear this saying once, but he can resist it, but he can resist it. But this time it can’t be because he knows it. I personally felt it from the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that is born, whether it is his or Rhodes's or two other broken dark souls or all the horrors of this world. All the sins of loneliness, all the struggles, in fact, how small and small between the running of the world is like a tiny dust is worthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the end point of our end. After walking so far, I finally got here." The sound of the hole in Rhodes began to be out of shape because his body has begun. collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assa has already divided his body into two, and then the body on both sides of his body began to scatter and become a small part of the body. Now it is already started. Scattered to the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, all of my things are given to me by you. I am giving you too. It’s time for me to return to you." The King of Spirit is also the last sentence of Rhodehart. Then he uses the hand that is about to collapse completely to put the handle of the Dark Star into Asa's left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the King of the Dead has become a fragment of the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body that lost the body also completely dissipated, but the memory of the other two souls is all in the consciousness of Asa no longer separate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this is the end." Asa murmured. The familiar atmosphere of the Dark Star is raging and the boundless darkness seems to be able to devour everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
