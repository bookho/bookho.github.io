Originally, according to the first impulse after getting the news at the time, he was about to fly away and went out to the Magic Academy, but after all, he still refused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old ministers, including Rhodes Hart, looked at the Cardinal with curiosity. They didn’t understand what kind of things would make them calm and calm. Bishop Wei was so surprised that he was out of control. But the bishop did not care about the eyes of the people around him. He is now only staring at the pastor from the magic school. Under the leadership of the swordsman, the priest crossed the blockade of the Paladin's swordsmen and came to the outside of the temple to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking clearly what kind of person broke into the cellar under the cathedral? What was the situation at the time?" The Cardinal asked urgently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pastor replied: "The man who returned to the bishop seemed to be a young man with a mask. He first hijacked the Ryan gods and got the cathedral. The key to the mantle in the middle of the earth then entered the cellar. Once he entered, he blocked the entrance to the tunnel with a strange magical ban. Ryan’s great priest wanted to break down and pursue it, but he couldn’t take the magical ban. Later, it’s not long before it came. After a big shock, I saw that the man ran out from inside. Although we had already arranged the man outside, but it was still surrounded by this person. Ryan’s great sergeant blocked it and was seriously injured by this magic... that magic... ...it seems to be a dead magic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that this person took something away? What kind of thing? Where did he go to the ground?" The cloth bishop asked sharply. His face has begun to show a near hysterical anxiety. There is also a slight tremor. This expression is only heard by the most infatuated man who hears his lover. It is not only anxiety that the most loving mother will see when her son is about to die. There is also panic and despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the people around are even more strange. They don’t understand how such expressions will appear in such a person as Bishop Jiawei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The villain did not see this person. But Ryan’s great priest asked me to report to the bishop, ask the bishop to return to the magic school as soon as possible. He has an important thing. I want to tell the bishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Javey sighed heavily and turned to the ministers and said, "I'm sorry. Here is the answer to Rhodehart. The adults and the people have been negotiating." The voice has not yet fallen. He has turned and walked out of the hall to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Cardinal flies away from the ground, everyone is a bit embarrassed. Or Rod Hart was the first to return to normal. He waved his hand to the priest who was still here. "Well, there is nothing left for you to quit here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this pastor did not move. Instead, standing on the spot and looking at the back of the cardinal disappeared. This was said slowly: "But the villain brought a good medicine to treat the Queen. This adult can ask the Queen to use it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The shape of the cardinal is like a thunder, and it’s like a fire. It’s just a short time to get to the palace gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his heart, there are also fires and thunders, and there is still a fierce fire. He knew very well how important the thing buried in the dungeon was if it was really obtained by that person. The consequences are absolutely unimaginable. He always thought that the person didn't know that even if he knew that he didn't dare to touch the ineligible to touch the thing, but how to know that his own time had given the other party such an opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What power struggles and conspiracy, the tyranny of the king, is completely a dispensable puppet show in the contrast of a series of things that the thing is associated with. So as soon as he heard the news, he should immediately concentrate all his thoughts and spirits on it and drop Rodhart and the ministers who are about to fall into control. Although the opinions of the things are gone, there may be some clues in the mouth of Ryan’s great god. Even if there is a small chance of being small, he can't let go of the possibility of recovering even if it is a little bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just rushed out of the palace gate and he grabbed a guardian’s Mazema and rushed to the Magic Academy. The white magic of the whiplash in the hand and the healing and recovery of physical strength is constantly being sent. The horse took the sorrow of the road and the distance to the usual level on the avenue of Wangdu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Do you have the medicine to treat the Queen's Majesty?" Everyone is a stunned look at the faces of the great ministers. Only Rhodehart was a glimpse of his eyes, and his eyes, which had been faint and showed no dew, suddenly emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is not going to be used by the Queen?" The old Marquis of Minsk was excited and his voice shook with his expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." The priest nodded and walked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait for a stop." A big drink burst from the mouth of Rhode Hart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ministers looked at Rhode Hart. He has already pulled the sword in his hand and pointed to the pastor and said, "Who made you come? You are not a magician. Even Ryan’s great priest does not know what the Queen’s birth is likely to give you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ministers are all following. They didn't think about this matter. The great priest did not know and would not doubt the identity of the pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light in the eyes of Rhodehart is brighter and brighter than the sword light in his hand. If it weren't for the pastor's body and that person's far-reaching relationship, he would almost think that this is the one they have been worried about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This priest’s body is not high, and even some small and small gestures are indeed an ordinary person’s movement without any abnormality. Even the Bishop Jiawei did not see the slightest The same. His face is also a very flat face. It belongs to the ordinary priest who can't be ordinary in the magic school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ministers also looked at the pastor with all sorts of doubts. Among them, the prime minister’s eyes are the strangest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ordinary priest does not seem to be afraid of the sword in front of him. It is still so plain and faint: "Ryan's great priest does not know, but Bishop Ronis knows. So he only has the medicine to cure the Queen's Majesty. It can come in handy when necessary."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt shouted to the swordsmen of the Paladins in the distance outside the temple: "Send a team to the Magic Academy to recover Master Jawi." I have noticed a little abnormal turn around and watched the pastor scream: "Nonsense. If Bishop Ronis really knows why he didn't treat the Queen early. Who is it that lets you send false information to lead Bishop Jiawei? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pastor looked at Rhodehart without hesitation and said slowly: "That was because Bishop Ronis was not completely sure before and could not think of it." Her Majesty the Queen will be exploited and reserved by others... In fact, it is not a nonsense. It doesn't matter if the Queen can get down. That is the most important thing. Do you say it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt’s hands The jump. He almost wanted to go up to the sword and first smash the priest's foot and then slowly ask, just by those words, he can be sure that the priest is at least that person. But although he doesn't seem to care about this person anyway, it seems that he is a forceless hand. But out of an intuition. He didn't dare to shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person's appearance looks no matter how ordinary. Unremarkable. But in such a situation, it is absolutely uncommon to maintain such indifferent calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor had a slight indifference in his eyes but made Rhodehart somewhat strangely chilly. He looked at the ministers around him and said, "If you don't believe me, you can let me know. The medicine left by Bishop Ronis will definitely be a problem for the adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, what medicine is coming out soon." The old Marquis of Minsk was eager to wave. In their eyes, this pastor does not matter if his identity is somewhat suspicious. After all, this is nothing in the environment surrounded by the Paladin. But if you can really heal the Queen. Even a one percent chance is naturally impossible to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. But this medicine must be made effective for me to use under the Queen." The pastor replied to the Queen who went straight to the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait"" Rodhart stepped forward and the sword was only three feet away from the priest's chest. "This person's suspicious personality must not allow him to approach his majesty at random. Maybe he is the spies sent by the mastermind." He raised his voice and shouted. "Come on. Bring this person down..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let him try. Anyway, His Majesty is already like this." A voice is a prime minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The identity of this person is unknown..." Rhodehart will have to say it again, but this time he is now the pastor's footsteps and does not stop but continues to the bed. The Queen walked down and he didn't even care about Rhodes's sword pointing at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
