			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the whisper of the whispering of a huge ancient tree in the tree hole, dozens of huge fireflies and soft light on the wall have just temporarily opened up the meeting The hall shines brightly. In addition to the elders of the Elves who are still in the King of Einfast, the Elder elders gathered here. In addition, there are three outsiders who are also in Asa Ayimei and the Adelaide master who came with Aimei on the Pegasus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am only apologizing for the loss caused by this misunderstanding and conflict to the whispering of the singer on behalf of the Tower of Tooth." Master Adelaide is facing Lucia. The elders bowed. She was covered in a blue-blue mage robes, and her head was covered with a soft glow of huge fireflies. Some of the smoky faces of the face were now full of seriousness and apologetic curly red rolls scattered on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Meimei, who is curiously looking around from time to time, looks forward to watching the fireflies on the walls of the tables and chairs transformed by natural magic, but always worried. . Yabin has not come back to the elves to visit and did not find the body Asa knows that it was probably taken away by the Tamika Knights. There is Talis in his life is worry-free, but Ai Meimei is in a burning heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Audley’s master is apologetically apologizing, but no one elf elder, including Luya’s face, looks good and there are many standing next to it. The elf face has an angry color. The half-small whisper of this battle was razed by the magicians. The geniuses were killed and injured by hundreds of people. The dead wood guards the loss-bearing husband. It is countless that the flies and horses are all in the army and even the eggs of the three wars are used. Even when it was in the forests of Tulain, it was only like this against Nigel’s army attack. I am afraid that this kind of thing can not be solved with a ‘misunderstanding’ to clarify an apology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magicians have all left and left only a mess. They also have dozens of casualties and all of them are *master-level elites. The same is terrible. The guilty master, Eden, couldn’t even leave a whole body, but he didn’t have to die. The two elements of the tower that were later brought to the end of the tower were loaded with the mage who were eliminated by the control of mental magic. All the magicians under the card were shocked. I only went back in vain. Only Master Aidelide stayed to apologize to the elves and discuss other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s just a woman and it doesn’t look too old. But no elder elders dare to look down on this man who seems to have no hands. When she rescued dozens of magicians on the ground, she used her own power to create a round ice wall that was strong and strong enough to be blocked by the impact of hundreds of dead wood guards. This ice wall is as high as tens of meters like an airless magician over a huge unparalleled bucket. This summons the venting elements into it and loads the magician below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to stay here is the courage and tolerance that people have to admire. The well water in the Sun Well has recovered a small half. Even if her magic power is high, the elves really want to do it, and I am afraid there is nothing left to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the face is hard to read. But the elf elders still accepted this apology after all. Luya really knows the identity of Master Eden’s necromancer. And things have already been born, and everyone is also dead and wounded. Now that the other party has already admitted the mistake, it is impossible to revenge with the tower of the tooth. The nature of the elves does not like unnecessary fighting and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although all this is the ghost of the Necromancer, the responsibility of our Tower of Teeth does not evade. As an apology, I am the tower of the water." The identity of the Tata Lord assures you that there will be no need to help the whispering of the whisper in the future. Although we open the tower of our teeth, we will not deny it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to this Commitment to Luya and the expression of several elders eased. If you really have such a group of allies. The whispering of the forest is neither worrying about security or strength. The horrible elemental magic that left them in the battle was deep enough. The elders exchanged a look with each other and several of them nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the elves are interested in elemental magic, we also welcome elves' friends to learn from the Tower of the Tooth. We must be able to give each other."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence makes the elder elders’ face fade again. Luya’s eyes are even brighter. Although all the magics are recorded according to the elves’ classics, they are actually from the ancient elves but inherited. Today, tens of thousands of years away from the fighting and killing elves, in addition to natural magic, elemental magic is almost never used, but it is human beings. And because the races do not interact with each other, there is no way for the elves to learn. And this proposal by Master Aidelide is undoubtedly a good opportunity to break this deadlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the elves' elders' faces and look at a lot of Aideli's masters. Then they said, "Just... there is a need for the help of Elder Luya. I don't know if I can do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Luya nodded: "Good. Since the Tower of Tooth can give us so much help, what you have to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Tower of the Earth The grandden tower owner was not known by Aiden and his acquaintance to use any method to make a serious injury. Even I can only see that it seems to be caused by a very unique curse. Now I have fallen into a deep coma... I don't know. Can Elder Luya be treated with the leaves of the world tree..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." All elders of the Elf family stood up at the same time and looked alert. increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? We are not asking for the leaves of the world tree, as long as Elder Luya uses the power of the leaves of the world tree to use the spell." Adelaide Master One The face is puzzled. "The rumored natural magic spells in the spells are even worse than the white magic. I have heard about the spells used by the elders of the war. I think it seems that only this kind of life magic can save the grandmaster. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two elders who coughed up. The elders also sat down. They also knew that their reaction seemed to be too radical and they all looked at Lucia. Luya clicked on it: "Then please bring the whispering singer to the Granden Tower. I try my best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aidley hastened Said: "But the Granden Tower is really unable to move now, or the life is worrying. I am afraid that you will ask Master Luya to go there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luya immediately nodded and said, "Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several elder elders have a sigh of relief. Although it has been closer to the alliance with the Tower of the Tooth, it seems that it is indeed dangerous to let the leaves of the world tree out of the whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't want Adelaide to stay here, watch the scenery of the whispering forest..." Asa, who had never been open, said suddenly. "I will first go to the Grandeur of the Grandeur to go to the Granden Tower and say it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Adelie seems to have a slight accident and could not help but see Asa At a glance, there was a flash of light in the pair of autumn waters. Then she sighed and said, "If you don't worry, I can stay here as a hostage. I will go back after you have healed Master Grandon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very understanding." Asa smiled and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To each other." The female mage also returned to Asa, a very charming smile, and blinked at him with a single eye. It was very smart and powerful. The ripples bounced on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without our elves, there is no such dirty habit of human beings." Luya is a direct wave. "I am going."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elder Luya, your kindness and trust in me is enough to win the respect of the Tower of the Tooth" Look at Luya. "Would it be too late to let us out now. I have a few reels of the tower of the tooth tower that I have left behind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't want to take the first step, we will come." Asa grabbed the Luya opening and said, "Well, I am waiting for you at the Tower of the Tooth." Adelaide Master looked at Asa and smiled. nod. Take out two transfer reels and put them on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true that she should be left hostage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait until Adelaide and After Ayi Mei left the other elder elders and negotiated, Asa only frowned and said to Luya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we and the Tower of Tooth really can solve this misunderstanding and become friends, how can we do the seizure of others as hostages?" Luya said . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled and said: "Do you know that if you open the distance and face the battle, this woman may be more difficult to deal with than the old ghosts flying around." As long as she is without her, I can guarantee your safety in the Tower of Tooth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But she doesn't look like a bad person and Ai Meimei is her I’m a disciple. If she’s really malicious, it won’t stop the fight.” Luya seemed to pinch her little fist with great confidence. "I believe she is a good person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
