			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-level mages in the Glorious Castle are not as good as the Tower of the Tooth but less than any other place. In a short period of time, there have been a dozen of squadrons at the edge of the square, and the thunder bombs, the fire, the giant rock, and so on, have been bombarded in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter whether the orc is strong enough to be under high-level magic, it’s always ** even the toughness of the bulls and vitality can’t resist the thunder bomb. But the orcs did not retreat. They came here not even to fight but to vent the mad revenge of anger and animalism. They began to scream against the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder bombs and fires are intertwined with hot and explosive fire nets, constantly screaming loud bangs and writhing orcs' limbs flying around but no orcs The slightest ambiguity was smashed into the formation of the swordsmen. In particular, the Orcs are driving the bulls. In addition to the direct hits of high-level magic, even the giants of the Master's summoning can't resist any obstacles in front of them, whether they are people or buildings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a small half-corpse of the beasts scattered all over the square into the buildings and lanes of the Glorious Castle. In the vast glory of the castle, the priests and swordsmen are tens of thousands of people, but the beasts are thousands but the body is much more flexible than the human swordsman, and there is almost madness and anger even if they are on the number. Far from the disadvantages, it does not fall into the wind. The battle that was originally only around the square has spread completely to the entire Glorious Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole glorious castle has already boiled, even though the light rain of the Purdue beings is still screaming at the screams of the swordsmen and pastors, it is still ringing everywhere. Even under the heavy weapons of the orcs, the curse of these restoration systems is not great. The intent of the orcs without any strategy and tactics is almost entirely based on instinctive killing impulses and anger as the most primitive beasts everywhere to see and kill. The Glorious Castle is full of chaos in the chaos of chaos and chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, no one naturally notices the movement of a person, no matter who this person is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was always a mess in the glorious castle showroom that has always been heavily guarded. There are some precious things like the treasures of the past Pope's relics. In addition to the magical array of protection, there are usually strict security guards. But now there are several priests who have rushed in to get some of the magic items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want to do for a few adults? This is mostly the relics of the Pope." The swordsman responsible for the guards stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you not hear the outside voice?" A priest shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside is the shock of the trotters and the screams of the swordsmen. There are a few bulls that have already rushed to the vicinity. There is also an old man who is rampaging everywhere. Swordsmen and priests are completely powerless and there are no high-level wizards. Only these things placed in the showroom are high-level magic props. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary people are fragile in front of the huge size and strength of the bulls. Even if the healing power of Purdue beings can heal a fatal wound, the swordsmen are usually The process of being completely deformed before the bull's head was broken or broken under the hoof of the hoof was not directly dead or crunchy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall of one of the showrooms suddenly shattered and a huge barbarian nearly three meters high appeared in front of everyone. There are several swords and lances on the cow and a few magical wounds. The half-orc animal trainer on the back of the cow has long stumbled on the back of the cow and did not move a long sword in his green ugly head. But in this case, there is no difference in the direction of the animal trainer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mouthful of concentrated acid gas in the mouth of a cow immediately sprayed two or three swordsmen on the sulfuric acid gas, which immediately corroded the ** The Purdue beings immediately repaired the wounds but the gas left on the body continued to corrode and healed and then eroded, causing the two swordsmen to scream on the ground. The bulls rushed to the remaining few people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several squadrons flew across the ground and flew away. Several altars for the items were smashed together with the protective magic array of the entire showroom. These magical arrays are mostly of the type of vigilance and magical protection that can't do anything under the power of the bull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many cows turned to another direction and saw that the two priests and the altar behind them would be smashed into a shadow and swept into the room. Before the bulls, they reached for a shot just on the forehead of the bull. Then the huge body of the bull was soft and fell to the ground like a drained pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enlai is just too late to be in trouble." The Cardinal seems to be relieved. He walked behind the priest and took a half of the scepter from the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...what do you do with this? The situation outside is very tight. You still have to go to the square to help, or it’s too late..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, ah, it’s too late to get there." Bishop Hamm walked with his scepter. The head of the two singers who screamed and screamed and flew out. Everyone else is still ignorant of what happened. With the hand of Bishop Hamm in the void, a few times, with some black lines flying in his hands, dancing around him, the other gods and swordsmen’s bodies are all like the building blocks. Blood is splashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head did not look back because Hamm was flying away with a scepter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope has been carried back to the room of the Temple of Light, and the Templars are kept outside. Only the Adelaide is in front of the Pope’s bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope’s breath is very weak and looks very old and very old. The original spirit of self-satisfaction is extraordinary. The old man seems to be alive after using the ring for the second time. A few hundred years old, who spent every bit of life's essence and vitality clean, only the last dying dying person. And the white magic that once was so majestic in his body is not exhausted, but because the body itself is exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adela and the other two cardinals also tried to treat but did not have any effect, even if Purdue had no effect on the pope's body for the rest of his life. Needless to say other white magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summon Guardian Angels Purdue beings This magical consumption of magical power is not vitality but life. It is something that no magic can recover. The use of two consecutive uses, even with the help of the King's Ring and the Glorious Castle, should be very astounding and the Pope's age itself is not small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty...Your Majesty..." Adela whispered but the Pope did not respond and Adela smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot and the other three Knights of the Temple together to fight against Gru on the square, and others put the spirit in this Riots and battles. After the pope fainted, Bishop Adela as the confidant of His Majesty the Pope naturally became the only person who could now be with the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you finally having today?" Adela looked at the bed, the pope smiled very brightly and very happy, but there was a kind of awkward taste in your eyes. I don't know how long I have waited for this day? Do you know how long I have endured this stinky old man? Finally let me wait until today... hahahahahaha..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the suppressed laughter, Ade stretches his hand to pull the Pope's fist. He saw very clearly that the king's ring in the air after the fall of the Pope in the Temple of Light also fell. It was already a semi-conscious comrade who could reach out and hold the ring in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope’s fist is very tight and people are very surprised. This is why the elderly who are dying and dying will have such great strength. Adela took a few strokes and failed to pull the pope's fist open. He slammed his feet in a hurry. Even if the pope was really dead, he couldn't use the knife to cut the pope's hand and let others, especially Lancelot. It’s got it when it’s over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when Adela wanted to find something small, when the crowbar, the pope on the bed suddenly opened his eyes and said, "You are too Let me down..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adra became completely as stunned as the clay sculpture, and the horrified eyes almost fell out and his The feet began to fight and kept shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing the words, the Pope coughed and tried to breathe a little deeper and suck more air, but it seems that even the strength of this has not been the words just now. He has already exhausted his accumulated strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tremors of the legs have spread to the whole body, Adela, like the sifting, watching the pope with two eyes on the bed. Although he just said it was smug, but under the years of the old man's accumulation, he was almost scared that even other ideas were gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are all kinds of explosions outside and the sound of killing is getting louder and louder. Adela's body is shaking more and more. The panic in the eye is getting heavier and heavier. The more the Pope is still struggling to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
