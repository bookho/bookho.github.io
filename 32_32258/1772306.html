			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the oath of the Tauren priest swayed in the hall, and it was as long as it was, it was very powerful and very helpful. But when the high priest returned to the table, Lancelot shook his head faintly and said, "Tima high priest, this vow is probably enough."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high priest's brows without eyebrows wrinkled together, and the two flames in the eyelids also thrived. Tima hadn't spoken yet. The dozens of Tauren guards at the entrance of the palace had already screamed and rushed in with a double-sided axe with one person high. From the time these seven people entered the hall, their eyes and attention did not leave. Like the Knights of the Temple, they have a lot of fire and killing in their hearts. Such suspicion is not just a disrespect for the horned devil, but also an insult to the high priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't believe in the vows of the gods? What do you want to do with these faded monkeys? You think we will be as accustomed to betrayal as you are. Nothing is clear?" Basile was screaming. The harpy does not believe in the Tauren sect, but the respect for the gods that they believe in is universal for all Asians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tauren who rushed over has already turned a big axe, the huge body of nearly three meters and the huge double-sided axe collided with a rhinoceros. Still more fierce. But the seven Knights of the Temple in front of the table are still sitting, and they are not moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough." The voice of Tima's high priest sounded like a loud drum. The footsteps of the Tauren Warriors stopped immediately. The high priest looked at the Knights of the Temple. They did not move. He also knew that as soon as someone moved, there might be someone who died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay. I understand." Tema's high priest waved at the guards of the two Tauren. "Go and bring my two sons." Soon after, the two and a half big calf heads were brought to the main hall. The height similar to humans shows that the two little bulls are still far from adulthood, and even those who don't know the characteristics of the Tauren can see that this should be a twin twin brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my two sons, the only two sons. I can send them to Celeste as a guarantee of our covenant vows." The voice of the priest is getting more and more heavy and heavier. "How, Lancelot Paladin, you feel that this guarantee should be enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot’s vision in the two little Tauren I glanced over it, seemingly hesitating, and finally nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, that's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After writing a letter, Lancelot handed the letter to the pope and two special delivery scrolls from Celeste to the two little Tauren. Then the two sons of the Tima High Priest used the transfer reel and disappeared from the main hall. Watching the two sons dissipate, the expression on the face of Tima's high priest was twitching, and he snorted heavily and sat down in Shiqi. The head of the Tauren guarding the palace had a low screaming in the throat. The emotions of these monsters are not positive at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of the Knights of the Temple is a lot easier. no doubt. This means that they really have the upper hand. But only Lancelot still seems to be unhappy, looking at the Tauren High Priest who seems to be extremely depressed. "If this is the case. We can also feel your sincerity. Then please tell the plan of your plan." And the details." Nigan has a magical array. Ai's mother-in-law actually has a scroll, but Asa can't use it. He is not a visitor to the underground world, and even if he is alone, he has no confidence in finding a place to go in a totally unfamiliar environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the magical array is in the center of the Tauren’s territory, where numerous labyrinths of criss-crossings allow any alien creature to starve to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And along with him, Ai Mei and Talis, Asa can not use this way. Fortunately, he was psychologically prepared for the long-distance brigade, and several of the scrolls that were searched from the Tower of the Tooth were summed up by the high-level elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Calendo Basin to Niegen, it is almost in the middle of the mainland, even if it is a temperamental way to summon this luxury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will take another twenty or thirty days to arrive. Fortunately, the scrolls are enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning of Asa was to ask Ai Meimei to go to Elasia, but Ai Meimei insisted on following him and Talis. And Ai’s mother-in-law actually agreed with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa shook her head: "Since the trouble is not small, I can't even let Ayi Mei go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai Mei also said very firmly: "I am now Only Talis sister and you two relatives, and I have to go with you for the big troubles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final insistence on Ai Mei under. Asa also had to let her sit on the gas. Since taking Talis as her sister, this little girl has finally recovered some anger and vitality. Talis’s face was not always good, since she heard the words of her mother-in-law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must know what is going on? Well, I tell you, 20 years ago, Magnus, who was still a cardinal, hired me to kill. Deken. Then he took the opportunity to sit on the throne of the pope. I am certainly used to commemorate this half of the scepter. I have to admit that he is the most difficult person to kill. I also killed it before I accepted the employment. The last one.” Ai’s mother-in-law looked at the female knight who would never give up knowing the truth, faintly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Impossible. How can you kill Deken? He is.....but...?" Talis It was said that this truth was shocked by this truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The killing and the frontal battle are two different things. Doesn’t Lancelot’s kid teach you this truth? And it’s not just me, Magnus. The guy certainly helped a lot. The guy seemed to have some thoughts of falling out of the way, but fortunately it just seemed to have this idea, or the Pope today should be Ronis or Ismail." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is how much Lancelot should know, although he was not a church person at the time, you can go back and ask him. But I advise you not to Ask Magnus himself, otherwise I promise that he will destroy your mouth, and maybe even give me your head to show his apologies and sincerity to me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible, such a thing..... How can such a person be a pope? How can he sit in such a high position?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be scared by this little thing, there are more complicated reasons why I don't have to talk to you more. The more the place is, the more complicated it is, the more complicated it is. The more complicated it is, the more dirty it is. You know more about it. The position of Celeste and the Pope is so high, of course, it can’t climb up with ordinary means. Compared with the Glorious Castle, the toilet in the inferior hotel seems to be cleaner." Ai's mother-in-law paused and added a smile. Patching the spirit of Talis’s imminent collapse, she also fainted with Asa’s head. "But your teacher, Lancelot is really a good guy. Such a good man, still a good man, is rare. But unfortunately, when I look at it, it is still a small hair, and my temper is also rushed. I missed the opportunity to pursue me. , huh, huh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was the previous Talis, this was enough for her to desperately smoke the sword, but she is now at least able to endure These sounds are completely different from what they know, because everything that happened during this time made her know that these may indeed be true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But knowing that it is to know, tolerate is to endure, to accept recognition from the heart, this is certainly not a short-term thing. The air elements summoned can only last for half a day. Fly every day until after the evening. Asa three people will camp on the ground, eat the wild game to eat next to the ditch fire, and wait until dawn to start. Although no movement is required above the gas element. But when it comes to the wind that is flying, it will be exhausting for a whole day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This world.....how can this be the case? Even the highest incarnation of the mainland, the pope is like that, then... "Justice? Light? Is there anything else?" These two or three days, the young goddess of the Knights muttered this sentence, and the look was uncertain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found out now that you are really like a friend of mine....a former friend? "One night, Asa once again heard Talis, if she didn't know whether she was complaining or talking to herself, said.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your friend? I am like? "Talis is stunned. She is in this state of mind all day long.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it’s like, at least this confused time. The words are the same. "Asa smiled. "It was the captain of the Paladin who sold us in the King of Einfast. He is my friend, a good friend of mine before. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
