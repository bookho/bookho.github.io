"Be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two white figures flashed from the shades of the trees on both sides, and the two swords were rolled up to the two. Jianguang is so hot, round and bright as electricity. This is a sword light that takes at least 20 years to smear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis spins and twists his sword. Although not as old as spicy, it is more rounded and brighter than the two swords. The light of the sword shines from the waist and actually sets up two swords at the same time. Two shots in one after the other, just a sword, blocked the two swords that came at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her sword certainly hasn’t been immersed in twenty years of hard work, but she has the talent to practice hard. Maybe 6 is the best teacher. Many times it is more useful than what you are immersed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis is a long-handed sword with two auxiliary white magic lights on his body. Although her gaze is looking at the two sneak attackers on the left and right, the voice is already somewhat proud: "This time, I remind you that you are also blocking a sword for you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; However, she immediately saw that Asa, who had jumped with him, did not land but rushed toward the depths of the forest like a broken Thunder. It wasn't that he was moving, but someone was chasing a gray figure behind him and a black fangs knife and Asa's knife in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'锵' A huge long, piercing gold and iron symphony with Asa and the man’s body shape even covered up in the distance The deafening explosion. The moment when the two men’s weapons intersected, there was no slightest sound. Instead, they came together to make a loud noise like thousands of people fighting each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the leaps in the air, Asa did not see the two swordsmen who were on both sides of the flame magic trap. He did not go to see. Pay attention. He didn't dare to pay attention. Because at the same moment he got up, it was impossible to pay attention to the murder of other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of this breath is completely without any signs as if it were naturally produced from the air. This breath is not strong, not like the murderousness of other people, so the claws are completely unpretentious and even peaceful. **The bare land expresses the simple meaning of this breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of letting people die. A calm and simple nature can't resist telling people that life is just that, after all, it means that it is impossible to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This breath appears so suddenly and naturally. If it’s not that Asa completely mixes the perception of meditation, it’s completely undetectable. If this is not the singularity beside the Sunwell. The volatility gave him more power and perception that he would definitely be late if he could feel it, then the knife would split him silently from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his knife in midair and just blocked the silent blow from behind. I also saw this sneak attacker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sinister middle-aged man. Even if it’s such a sneak attack, the expression and look on this person’s face are almost dull nature. Just doing the same thing as usual. This expression and the calmness of the knives that emerged from this knife, but the naked murderousness is a natural part of the life that has been seen as a natural part of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only such a person can kill such a horrible knife from behind. It is not until the knife is released that it will be noticed because the knife itself brings out the murderous and imposing manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man has a sharp, long, knife-like knife on his back. This knife is completely contrary to his people. It seems that the words "killing" and "dead" are directly created in the roar of countless souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is good at holding this knife. It does not mean that it is completely parried. The dark long knife trembled desperately to break through his resistance and he was desperately resisting. The two knives are intertwined. But they crush each other at a very fast frequency and degree. Rub the chop. The vindictiveness and the murderousness and the momentum also collide with each other through the two knives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person was completely suppressed by the slap in the back. The skill and momentum of this knives have completely integrated with this person's mental and soul. Although they are not horrified, they are not able to resist. Asa only feels that his defense line may be broken at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foot of the retreat finally landed, but the person still continued to retreat from this block or did not completely block the muscles of the knife and the hand and the vindictiveness in the hand, and may not be at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa suddenly puts a large group of dark green flames out of the knife with one hand and presses the body's body to the deodorant and decay of the past. The breath is as good as the color of the dead green, and it is known that this is not an ordinary flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is betting that this person will not fight with him. Even if this person can make this knife seriously injured or even killed him, this group of flames will burn on him and the result of this flame mixed by the necromantic magic will definitely not be as much as the knife. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, even if Asa himself had let go of defense and resistance, but this person did not dare to continue to work, he could only kick his feet and squat. On the chest of Sa, the relay flew back and forth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slap of blood spurting out of Asa feels that this foot does not seem to lie on his chest but directly into the heart, liver, spleen, lungs and kidneys Pressing it almost made him spit out his heart and lungs with this blood. But with this blood spurting out the dead green flame in his hand, it was wrapped in a fireball and shot out with the figure that the man flew back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This blood has not been sprayed, he has his hands and even two or four green fireballs whistling like a beaded screaming from his hands. The curve orientation and time difference hit this person. The air suddenly heated up and it was still the kind of hot and dead scent that burned the rotten corpses so that people could not wait to cut their noses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the sneak attacker’s face was a little surprised. This is no longer a fireball but more like a small meteor shower. Even a level-high magician can't seem to shoot like a dart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a black long fangs knife that ran straight through the middle of the fireball. The fireball did not explode but was like a fruit being chained to the knife. The long knife that he continued to retire from the black kept spearing out that the fireball that had been swirling was actually stabbed on the knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireball on the fixed knife has been mixed into a huge green flame group. The expression of this person is also somewhat dignified and difficult. He took a knife from the fireball and took out two pairs of knives and feet. One after the other, a screaming low-like drink, and the next black brilliance flashed through the green dead fireball from which the black slash was broken. The knife light also came straight to Asa here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sideways, let the big tree behind him make an unpleasant snoring and the knives that are pulled out by this knife are divided into two pieces. This set of action-packed movements is so natural that it can even prevent Asa from continuing to pursue the peak of martial arts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireball broke into two halves without exploding but still did not disappear and the two green flames fell. The man’s hand flashed two white radiances of green flames and the ray of light shone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed with a sigh of relief to cure the magic just to circulate in the body and replied all the injuries. Although the fluctuation of the sun well is still weak, it still has a lot of excitement for his magical power. The two opened the distance and he took a serious look at the sneak attacker's heart. If this is not a whisper, it is not next to the Sunwell. He may have died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person has not attacked but is looking at Asa. It seems that this sneak attack did not surprise him. He scratched Asa again and again with a wood-like look. He said, "Is you killing Ashur?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa's face Still with a mask, but the previous fight, especially the nectar of the dead spirit fireball is almost his identity. The story of the use of Necromancer by the assassin who stabbed Achill’s bishop has already been circulated in Celeste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Asked Asa. This person just used white magic but can pierce the fireball containing the magic of the dead spirit and then split it together. Even if this person’s martial arts is high and vindictive, it is impossible to do it alone. The only possibility is that The black long knife is also attached to the dead magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tamik is a Talis Knight." The two sneak attackers over there said. The two men were recognized by each other after being attacked by Talis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come you are here?" Talis walked over and looked at the sneak attacker. Although few people in Celeste know this mysterious knight, Talis, as a disciple of Lancelot, is one of the knights who know him at least. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
