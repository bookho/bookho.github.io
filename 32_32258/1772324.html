			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only effect of the subtle space lock reel is to prohibit all transfer magic in the surrounding space for a period of time. In such an environment, in such a situation, the intention of the Tauren priest is no longer necessary. Lancelot only felt that his heart was starting to cool. It’s not just him who knows how to keep a trick in the back, or that it’s not just the Pope’s. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not think of such a possibility, but in addition to the Tema high priest, there is really no one in the Tauren who deserves the fear of the Knights of the Temple. The Tauren, a man of poor spiritual culture, can never have the ability to make such high-level magical items. Be aware that even Celeste does not have the top-of-the-line reel of the gravity field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to say, these scrolls, or the traps behind them, are not just the Tauren meaning... but now it’s not going to delve into this problem, because no matter What is the answer, it does not make sense to the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really want to thank the Knights of the Temple for helping us solve the biggest problem of Morial. But the Thamma priest is confessed, Moriel as Nigan The greatest existence in the past 100 years, how should the Lord bury the burial. Although I don’t know where there are two Knights of the Temple, I can’t kill you. I believe that the Tima priest will be very happy.” The priest finally spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in the passage outside the cave, on the edge of the gravity field. Being able to speak such a fluent human language, I can see that his status is not low, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mind is definitely the leader of these monsters that are not so good. . Otherwise, you will never wait until this forced situation reveals <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at a few who are not opponents are trying to stand firm, the Tauren priest reveals a triumph that other races are hard to imitate<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color, a sn sound, the light in the huge bull's eye. Every Knight of the Temple here has at least a hundred Taurens on his hands,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paladin Lancelot is a wicked in Ninegan for more than a decade. The same legend as dreams. Killing them is not just a sense of accomplishment and revenge, but also a great capital for the promotion of status in the family.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot did not speak. He is also speechless. He only felt that blood flowing in the blood vessels was not blood, but mercury, and the heart was almost broken to maintain the body's functioning. The full force of the Holy Cross sword is to exhaust his power, and the center of gravity of this gravity field seems to be around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few sounds, the three Knights of the Morrison Knights struggled to move toward the cave, and every step of the steel boots stepped on the rock. It will cause the rock to split, and even the back is half-bumped. It should have been a light and agile raccoon. It seems to be the old man carrying a cow on his back. Although the Glorious Battlegear launched the Heavenly Blessing attached to it, the weight of the Battlegear can also kill a cow in this case. Their vindictiveness and strength have already been consumed almost when they first joined Moriel. The injuries on their bodies are also quite heavy. Although there are white magic treatments, the vindictiveness and physical strength consumed cannot be restored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rocky ground began to smash under great gravity, the cave was shaking, and rocks were falling down the cave. A small group of rocks hit a knight. In the splash of the cracked stone, the Knights of the Temple were almost beaten to the ground by this stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the top of the head. Maybe the head of this shrine knight can't keep it. In the case of gravity anomaly, the fall from the heights is far more lethal than the magic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilska raised his gold bow in his hand and opened the bowstring to catch an arrow. This was originally because he didn't know how many times he did it, but now he seems to be struggling to do it. His bow and muscles and blood vessels on his arms seemed to stretch out the skin, and the sweat on his forehead ran down like a race. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Devil's Arrow is shot with all the remnants of the Knights of the Temple, bringing out the wind like tearing dozens of layers of thick kraft paper. In the air that has become thicker by the gravity field, the arrow that should have been like a thunderbolt lightning does not appear to be fast now, and it seems that there is still some off-track fall. The Tauren priest was hiding in a wolf, and the broken magic shot made a loud noise on the rock wall behind him. The whole rock wall spanned a large piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the other three Knights of the Temple had waved a white light to the Tauren priest in the dodge, but the body of the fire element moved, and the three white lights shone like the cow into the sea. I have disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple are very ugly, this originally used to deal with the undead biology light archery is now the only white magic that can play a role. In terms of their powerful combat power, they are dedicated to assist. The white magic that was dispelled was originally the most suitable for the Knights of the Temple, but this is gravity, not a curse, white magic is good at dispelling, and blessings can't play any role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple are not all knights. They are the top battle teams in the mainland, and naturally there are magicians who are good at attacking magic. This time I came to Nigan and there were two magicians. But the black dragon itself is almost immune to the magic of all elements, and their role here is limited, and more importantly, they all perform the secret tasks of other popes. Now the absence of these two people has become their deadly place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tauren priest reveals a half head behind the fire element, revealing a sly smile with his good head, and he holds three scrolls in his hand. A wand. If it is in peacetime, even if he has these reels, he can't hit an opponent like the Knights of the Temple, but now, the five people in the gravity field are just his live targets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is Lancelot or the Knights of the Temple, there is only a sense of despair in their minds. Because they all guessed what the scrolls were in the hands of the Niu Tau Sacrifice, and they knew that there was no way to resist the dodge under such circumstances. From these scrolls, this is really not just a trap for the Tauren. There are definitely other people involved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the person who intervenes is not the design of the traps, but the choice of these scrolls is seamless, not only makes them unaware, fully integrated into the shadow of their own actions In the middle, and once this shows the true face, it has not left them a little chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this dragon, the five top human warriors, under the magic scroll, is just the lamb to be slaughtered in front of this Tauren. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, there was a sudden noise coming from the passage to the outside, and there was a huge footstep that was unique to the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reinforcement? What happened to the Tima High Priest? How come there will be reinforcements coming here?" The Tauren priest twisted and looked, seeing A black elf's unit, the foremost war culmination is carrying the singular knight to rush here. The keen knights also saw the bullhead priest, shouting and charging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Niutou priest is somewhat surprised, but not too flustered. The scroll in the hand that was supposed to be against Lancelot was only sent directly to the black elves in the ramp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dazzling ball of light was sent from the hands of the priests of the head of the ox, and the incomparable heat wave ushered in the reinforcements of the black elves. The foremost knight of the knight was only able to make a scream of sorrow, and it became dark under the extreme heat of the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s all the way to the corner of the ramp, the light ball of the top magic of this fire is completely dissipated. The enchanting knights that had been in full swing had all become a sacred body, and the charred smell of the flesh filled the martyrdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the noise in the channel is only getting bigger and bigger. More features Black Elf soldiers and knights rushed into the priest's gaze from the corner. The corpse of the ground did not let them have the slightest hesitation, still shouting and rushing here. From the growing sound of the passage, the black elf soldiers behind will only be more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Niutou priest was slightly confused. This time he rushed to launch two other reels, and two thunder bombs hit the top of the passage. In the bang, the top of the channel completely collapsed. A large piece of rock fell down and piled up the passage, and all the black elf reinforcements were resisted, but this blockage was obviously impossible to maintain for too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tauren priest looked back and watched the Knights of the Knights who were still struggling in the gravity field, although the three most powerful reels have been consumed. But there is also a lightning wand and two fire elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The element giant consisting of pure fire elements does not have weight. This is the only object that can move in this gravity anomaly area. A giant of fire elements drifted toward the nearest knight, while the Tauren priest, who was still hiding behind a fire element, waved his hand and the white lightning flashed from the top of the wand to a knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
