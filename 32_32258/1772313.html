			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of the skin, the hair, the temperature, the smell in the nose, the taste in the mouth, all these bang in his mind The brain exploded. All the oppressive gloom and darkness are gone, and the vitality and vitality are all replaced by madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis was surprised at the beginning, and then desperately wanted to break free. But Asa's hand was very hard, and she seemed to want to crush her hard, she couldn't break free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment she was overwhelmed by him, the hand around her waist actually came to her chest, and she could feel the palm of her hand through the leather armor. The squeeze from the upload, a strange scent of numbness felt across the body. After a moment of powerlessness, she was ashamed and angry, and all the strengths were made into a fist and hit the head of Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this fist was directly held by Asa. He now has a beast-like whisper in his throat. His mind is temporarily lost. The instinct of the battle is still there, especially for the impulsiveness of his current impulsiveness. As a life, all the activities are the most lively, the most energetic, the most fascinating, the most fascinating, and the ones that forget the death are the impulses now. This is a rush.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The impulse to be able to continue, this impulse is the purest release of life itself. He pressed on her body. The hand in her chest grabbed the leather arm and pulled it hard. The leather armor, together with all the clothes inside, was pulled apart. The chest was pulled out under the smashed corset. He held it and felt his blood rushing. In burning for Asa, this is the greatest instinct and impulse to forget to die, he has been completely immersed in it; but for Talis, this is an unprecedented fear. She never thought that she would have such an encounter. The chest was cold, and then there was a warm and violent touch. She was horrified and the other hand madly inserted into Asa’s eyes. Both vindictiveness and magical light are flashing. In this case, she has no way of distinguishing whether she should be struggling or fighting or killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hand was still caught by Asa without looking at it, and then her hands were held together by one hand and pressed together. Above the top of the head. Asa single-handedly ripped off her clothes, and the naked skin was stuck together, and both of them trembled at the same time. Feeling the temperature and heat from the skin, Talis is in fear. But her biggest fear is not the fear of itself. But fear<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;herself. She felt that there was something in her heart that seemed to be moving around. To be entangled with the touch of this body, she has become soft and hot. So she is even more terrified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of fear, she is struggling even if she has been unable to struggle with soft hair. But she immediately felt his legs merged into his legs, spread open, and posted up. Even if she is separated from each other, she can feel the strange heat. Immediately the hand slid down from behind her back. The body where I passed was all soft and crisp, and then it felt a little pause in her waist because of the obstacles of her underwear, and then she got into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange and irresistible impact finally broke through Talis’s thinking and will, and she screamed insanely. The sharpness of the voice has never been heard by herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the very beginning, she closed her mouth tightly and tried not to say anything. One is because she has to resist his mouth, and the other is that she still remembers how far Ai Mei is sleeping. But at this time she had forgotten everything. She instinctively felt that she was about to collapse at once, and screamed with all the lasting struggles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screams echoed in this huge cave and spread out far. Asa’s ear was almost at her mouth, which almost passed the sound of the eardrum, and the tingling of the sound that almost penetrated the eardrum stopped his movements. The consciousness is also awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action was stopped, the sharp tingling in the eardrum immediately turned into a real sting, and it was painful. Talis bite Asa’s ear. The call just now is not the voice of the knight. This action is not the action of the knight, this is the voice and movement of the woman. This kind of tingling is just a part of Asa's waking up. It has already filled every part of his body with desires and it can't be dispelled. But immediately, I felt like this. Asa jumped up. The nature that can be more intense than this tangible impulse is only the same sense of crisis. Asa didn't just jump up on her own, but also took Talis up from the ground and jumped away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
