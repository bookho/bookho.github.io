			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of Ronis was assassinated by the Duke to lead the School of Magic and the Paladins to join forces to kill the Master of the Spirit. The murderer of the murderer arrested the Minister of Finance and informed the nation that it would annihilate the Lord... The series of explosive incidents rumored to sway around the radiant earthquake around the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rumor that the flight is spread is the wanted order and the Duke’s notice that these things will reach the town and will immediately make the place boil. Not only the adventurers, the thieves, the mercenaries, but also the excitement of these things. The ordinary people are also passionate and devout believers. Because of the murder of Bishop Ronis, they also cried and painted the portraits on Zhang Tong’s orders. One day can avenge the respected bishop. And rumors have also spawned dozens of different versions in the word of mouth to discuss the speech in the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Water Town is a remote town in the eastern part of the Empire. When it was swept by the shock wave of this news, it was almost shaken with other places. In addition to the pub becoming the most lively place, the town hall was also very busy. It is not only necessary to deal with the adventurers who come to ask for new news or announcements. Because the wanted order is official, it must be searched in the town. The bones of the mayor were falling apart one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The search came back to his chair. The mayor finally sighed and turned to the police and complained: "I don't know why I have to search this way." Will the pagan criminals be stupid enough to be sent to the door?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the Sheriff did not answer or even did not hear it. The muscles on the face seem to be out of control. The mouth is stretched at least to fit into the fist of your fist, and then the eyeball will fall out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor looked strangely along his line of sight and was now entering the door of the town hall. Then his own facial expression immediately went out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is not just swaying and arrogant. He rampaged and pushed all the people in front of him to the front of the local officials. He screamed and asked: "Are you a local official here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person’s eyes are all bloodshot facial features, all distorted by emotional excitement Deformation, anger, anger and fierceness are all on his face. But the reason he was watched was not because of his expression but because of his appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the emotion is distorted, his face can be recognized at a glance. Because this is the face that they just went to the streets to search for the value of 5,000 gold coins that no one knows no one is familiar with the face that no one is always worried about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you the biggest official here?" This is now recognized as the most wicked and most ridiculous wanted man who patted the local official's table and was already roaring. He is the same as the governor of justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sheriff who has responded has pulled out the sound of the sword’s original drink because it is too excited to become a woman-like scream: "Where are you~~~ ~ Grab him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you the mayor?" Ten minutes later. Already covered in blood, he slammed his desk and kicked his desk to the corner of the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes..." The mayor has already urinated his pants. The wounded almost filled the ground in the town hall. The buzz of hundreds of people at the same time seems to be a chorus of eccentricity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wanted to grab the mayor. The mayor awakened to the wicked guy in front of him who was the Necromancer who thought that he would soon become a skeleton or zombie. Immediately lost control together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this person just shouted at him: "You go to the king to give me a message. Pass to the Duke of Mulak." The voice of this wanted man because Angry and hoarse like a beast. "You told him to be careful. If he wants me, I will come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are wounded people walking around the town hall, Asa only feels the liver and gallbladder Blood is boiling like boiling. There are always three figures in his mind floating in the Ronald Bishop Sandro. The background is the Duke's smile and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today he passed the town and saw his wanted order in the pub. He also knew that the death of Bishop Ronis was suddenly struck by lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Ronis. Although Asa does not agree with his approach and even hates it, Asa knows that the most respectable veteran of the whole empire is actually very concerned that he cares for him. He can even say that many of his efforts are for himself. And such an old man actually died inexplicably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't have to think much about how this is going on. The Duke’s notice has already explained everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of the Duke’s notice is equally obvious: come back soon. Either you die or she dies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looks to the west. It is the direction of the king. The sunset is red. It seems that the Duke's smile is so amiable and a bit bloody and cruel. As if laughing and saying to him: Come over soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Duke has already notified the country, if he does not appear at that time, he will definitely burn the cockroach. He must go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far from the town hall is already a black and crushed figure. Almost everyone in the town has begun to come around. Someone recognized him from the mask he had taken into the town hall, and the news immediately spread in the town with the limits of the human leg. The adventurous mercenaries followed and the few mercenary gangs that first rushed to the town hall climbed out and the people behind them had to stand up. But the courage of people has grown with the increase in the number of people gathered. Until then the townspeople also came with a hoe knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thousands of people who saw him coming out of the town hall gathered early and yelled at him with a shouting scream. Asa jumped on the roof of the street and leaped westward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wangdu Dangdang smiled happily when he heard Asa’s message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke carefully asked about the time and place where the person appeared. Even the expression and movement of the person were asked in great detail. Then he nodded with satisfaction. He knows that his trap has actually produced results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the most effective trap? That is the trap that the other party knows that this is a trap and has to be drilled inside. The Duke has always been a master of traps because he will use humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he does not seem to realize that the more in-depth study of this kind of thing, the more ingenious it is, the lesser it is. This point reached a new height after he decided to continue to move toward the topless peak of power and use his daughter as a bait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, after making this decision, he was sad and depressed for a while but only for a while. The rational judgment of the situation and the relationship has masked this weak emotion without much effort. However, just because this kind of weak things are getting less and less, he can think more rationally and more rationally and without scruples. It is like a machine with incomparable precision. A machine that goes to action for power. Even he himself has to admit that he has indeed stood tall in terms of using the means to play with power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a height that you don’t know how to look back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke used his precise thinking to think about it for a moment. The boring message that was specifically sent out by people is just the name of the wild beast in desperation. Expressing the desperate anger in a snack. Objectively, it will not have any effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who sent the letter has sent the message but the person has not appeared yet. There are only two possibilities. One is to find a rescuer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This possibility is minimal. It is necessary to know that this kid is now a common wanted criminal of the church and the empire. No matter who the great man is, he will never dare to help. That is undoubtedly a sign that it is related to the killing of Bishop Ronis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second possibility that this person is now in the king but is lurking and not afraid to come out and wait for action. I think that the Duke immediately ordered the Wangdu Guards to be on standby at all times. Also, please ask the Paladin to send the guards of the prison three times more.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kid will definitely vote for himself. The duke is very confident. Those who are bound by emotions and who are driven by their own impulses are simply synonymous with stupidity and can't escape their own layouts with fine and rational arrangements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prison of the Wangdu Guards is the prison that the Duke ordered special attention. Nearly a thousand elite soldiers have been hoarded outside. There are also many people in the middle of the Paladin and the magician of the Magic Academy. As long as the one of the wanted criminals, the leader of the Paladin, who was personally led by the head of the group, can arrive within ten minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell the truth, this kind of earth-shattering practice is not in line with the Duke’s style. But he can't take care of it now. He must kill the kid as soon as possible. Because there are other things next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke put Clavis and Otaru together. These two are extremely important hostages. Naturally, we must concentrate together to prevent any mistakes. The reason for this is that the Duke pays attention to the father who escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell the truth, the Duke had to express his admiration for the ruined son who had always looked down on himself because of the Marquis of Ham. He can run away immediately after he finishes, but he can't help but say that he is superb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to complete the value of his use. The assassination of the bishop of the Lord will definitely destroy his mouth. After killing his mouth, his son could not escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather, after he ran away, the Duke would not have to start with Clause in order to be able to have capital. So it is a wise choice to escape at the first time. He is a smart person. So be prepared to take care of him and take his son away with whatever means he did not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Duke did not care too much about the Marquis’s at least the first time he was busy dealing with Asa. Because the Marquis are obviously just a little clever. Look at the sloppy look of the ruined family, although there is a clever mind that can see his intentions, but it is a waste of such good minds and talents in the sensual dog and what kind of shit art on the female color, and finally have to be themselves I have to hold it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being emotionally entangled that is stupid and those fancy little cleverness is simply incorrigible than stupidity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real big wisdom is to use it to decide to give up everything else that hinders everything. Focus all your energy on your goals and use them all. Everything is used to finally reach the peak of success. Just like yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the Duke’s feelings like a long-lost pride in the chest. He stood at the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wangdu’s brightly lit terraces are all available here. The Duke reached out and grasped the scenery. The hands that were covered with blue veins and honed and hard-working traces were so powerful and so strong. As if all this bustling, he can shake hands. Of course, there are countless stupid people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the king. The two people who were once the Duke’s closest in the heavily guarded dungeon are now completely opposite to the Duke’s mood. They don't just see any prosperous and vitality and even have the right to hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conditions in the dungeon are not bad even better than ordinary hotels. These two are even special prisoners but their status is still special. And the Duke did not mean to abuse them. He hopes that both of them will live well, at least when they are still useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no guard in the dungeon. The words spoken by the two men are likely to be highly confidential. The Duke did not want to send out the meals and sent them to the nephew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis has basically saved his life with the efforts of the pastors of the School of Magic. But his spirit has almost collapsed. When he was a little better, he ran to the steel fence all day and screamed to see the Duke of Mulak screaming to the scorpion and couldn't make all the food he had thrown around. It is a pity that the Duke of the two prisoners has already issued a ban, no matter how he barked, he did not respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After no longer shouting, Clauvis is watching his own hands that have been completely abolished, crying and laughing, sometimes using his teeth to bite that hand. I was so bloody that everything in my cell was smashed. Sometimes I took my own wall and hit the wall, but I never committed suicide. For a while, Xiaoyan suspected that he was completely insane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hysterical clamor, Crowes suddenly quieted down. He only muttered in a cry: "It turns out that the only use value I have for him is this life." Then he shrank into the corner and fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days of Otaru in the dungeon are much quieter and smoother. Of course, this quietness is only relative to the case of Clauses. After all, she was imprisoned by her father as a bait to lure her beloved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey. Can you hear me talking?" One day, Kravis spoke. Although it is a weak voice, it is no longer a screaming scream but a speech to others. There is no third person in this dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small but slightly surprised but still faintly replied: "Listen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two The cell of the person is diagonally opposite. As long as they do not look at each other deliberately, they can only hear each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you so calm? Do you think he will come to save you?" Crowvis asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small a little more surprised that Klauvis should not participate in the Duke’s action and spend most of his time in drowsiness. She couldn't help but ask: "You know why I was locked up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard the soldiers on the way to the Ducal Palace and on the way to here. Some of the conversations that Bishop Ronis was assassinated wanted the bastard... I probably guess what is going on. I have always known the Duke adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh You must also why he caught you up." Xiao Xiao replied faintly. She has never felt good about this person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if you don't know it can probably be guessed now. I know that my father went to see the Duke and then the bishop was stabbed." Clausis The voice has always been with a cry of nothing. "Then do you know that the two of us should be dead? Since the Duke adults can safely shut up the two of us who know so many people, it will never let us live and talk."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why are you still so calm? Prepare every day. Fantasy him to save you Then the two of you, like the male and female protagonists in the story, joined forces to escape from birth and go flying high? Ha ha... Haha..." Clavis should be laughing but the voice is actually crying. It turned out that he was paying attention to the movements of these days. "Do you think he will come to save you? I know that I am still dead? Is he so stupid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;小懿 silently muttered as if Saying to himself: "I hope he doesn't be so stupid. But... if he really comes, at least I have to find a way to let him leave safely. Do my best."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, haha..." Clavis was crying again. "Since the Dukes are so arranged, they will never give you any chance to struggle. As long as the bastard saves you and is caught, you are really on the same fate."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that you really know him." Xiao Yan’s voice has always been so flat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understanding...I understand of course. I have been with him for so long...hehe....I also know that he is very kind to me. He actually I didn’t cut my tongue and the ribs of my hands and feet, so I could wait here to die...hehe.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;小懿 did not answer. Klauvis did not ask for a while and then resumed silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days of silence, Clovis suddenly asked: "Do you know how many days are left from the time the Duke gave the bastard? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thirteen days." Xiao Xiao answered. She remembers it very clearly every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thirteen days. Hehe. You wait slowly. See if he is an idiot or believe that he will come. You are an idiot."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small does not answer what is still doing what to do. Clovis is no longer snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second day, Clauses made another noise: "There are twelve days left. The idiot still doesn't appear....not maybe it has already appeared, but already Was killed by the soldiers outside. Hahahahaha... really stupid..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;小懿 ignored him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are eleven days left... The idiot must have been caught by the Duke. Haha. The duke of the hated bastard will not It’s so cheap to kill him. It’s going to be a slap in the face. It must be a very enjoyable thing. This kind of thing would have been hand-made by me, hehehehe... but it’s not working now. It seems that the idiot first put I also have his foresight when I get disabled. Hahaha... Hey, are you listening?...I will give you a voice... Are you dead?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are nine days left. This number is unlucky. Have you heard it? You idiot woman who believes in idiots... Did you hear it. Haha..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" There are still eight days left...." Clovis reported the date every day and often said that he didn't care what the little priests ignored. Xiao Xiao did not care about him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Seven days... Maybe someone will come to arrest you, the Duke will kill you personally? Hehe...the Duke’s adult breaks himself The daughter can also kill without hesitation. All actions are so rational and so efficient. It’s my idol. Hahaha....”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Day...." "Five days..." "Four days..." "Feed the stupid woman. There are three days left..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't you remind me today? There is still the last day of tomorrow." Xiao Yan suddenly spoke first. Maybe these days have been harassed by him. Maybe there are things in my heart that are making her uncomfortable looking for someone to talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm tired and don't want to say anything more." Clovis's tone has been steady and not as mad as before. In fact, the more he seemed to be calmer and later, he didn’t even open his mouth yesterday. "And I was thinking about things in the past few days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?" Xiao Yan now feels something in his heart. I really want to talk to people. Even this is the most hated person she thinks is in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis actually sighed: "I am only now. I am too much worse than you. You and I know that I am dying but you still So calm down to prepare for things that are only one in ten thousand possible. And I am almost crazy. Even now. I dare to face reality and expect a miracle... I understand now what my father said. In a word, the higher the climb, the more he slams, the more painful he will be. The more I wake up. I am completely awake now. It’s strange that I am the one who hates my father the most, but the person I miss the most is him...” At the beginning, it was said that it was probably that all the things in my heart had been gone out. "Actually, I was recognized as the most outstanding genius in my family. But because my father's relationship is being squeezed by others, I may not even be qualified as a family member. I am not willing to work harder." Work hard, I swear to myself, I must be outstanding. I must have the greatest power. I must stand at the top of this world. I want to be the strongest in this world. Finally, I will be inherited by the leader of Roland as a disciple. I am very happy with the position of the head of the Paladin. At this time I met the Duke of Mulak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Duke is so strong The cleverness of such a power to fight for power is so brilliant. He is a person who can stand on the top of the world. He is completely my idol and my life goal. So I am determined to follow the Duke adults. Be sure to become the Duke. The same person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I became the deputy of the Duke, I was so happy. I felt like I was standing in the world. At the top. I regard him as a god. His command is even greater than my own will. Hey. It’s strange to say. I admire him because he uses people, including myself, when I have no value. Throw me away like a rag... Why do you still feel that I hate it? No snoring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. Just surprised and surprised." Xiao Yan’s voice did bring some unexpected taste in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you surprised?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amazed that you were also a person." A touch of tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably because of the death, but it seems that you will be faster than me. You will die tomorrow." Clovis’s voice is smaller than Even more timid, although there are feelings but not life, it seems that there is a taste of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Yen. Probably."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really thought he would come to save you. Unfortunately, even if he wants to come, the sooner the better. The more the outside is, the stricter the outside. If it is in the court, it will come to die with you. So he hasn’t come until now and can only explain that he is not "It will come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s best if you don’t come." Xiao Yan said that this sentence is a bit sorrowful and sorrowful. The corner of the eye is already wet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
