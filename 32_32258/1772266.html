			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whispered forest is located on the side of the Sunwell. There is a huge tree that is so big that it is almost unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only a few shallow layers in the bottom of the tree. The well water and the boundless power contained in it are used as nutrients to feed this huge tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the branches of each piece of the growing tree are growing like snails slowly and become thicker and larger. However, the degree of this in the trees seems to be not as slow as can be described, even if it can not be said that it can be said that it is somewhat strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the growth of the whole day. The war tree seedlings that were originally reduced to only a larger tree size have become the diameter foot. There are huge trees in half a mile. But it still doesn't end and it takes about a whole day for the Elven War Tree to grow completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day, the power of the Sunwell will be restored and combined with the power of the ancient trees of the war. Even if you face any of the forces on this big 6 It is possible to show that the weak elves also have the capital to negotiate with any force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whispering of the singer is now almost completely changed. The elves have almost moved the entire forest in Tula. Although there is no way for the tree house to move, the magic of the magical native sacred elf mage in this element is almost doubled. However, almost one day later, according to the pattern of Tula, a huge settlement was opened in the whispering forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These work is carried out by several other elder elders. Luya looked at the old trees above the war and was so busy that she couldn’t help but smile and smile. The star bursts like a moon. Her smile is not like a flower, no matter what kind of flower, it is impossible to show the half-point style of her smile. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whispering genie of the whispering tens of thousands of years is the only one in which she lived alone. The quaint and stiff elf culture was already in the fire. Disappeared in the middle. The elves that are now re-emerging here are the strongest. Although they have lost the ancient rigid traditions, they have exchanged new words and hopes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Machine must be such a change, even if you see such a change, you will be happy to accept Luya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if I’m going out in the world for a while. Her current mentality has been more keen on how to better control the hand on the ground. The female prime minister she saw in Wang Du was actually the one who made him a nightmare. This is what she heard in the story she heard on the journey. He has already gone to rescue her in tens of thousands of troops. No one knows the story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The savvy and sturdy look and temperament of the female prime minister made her feel a little envious of her envy and jealousy. It seems to be a child in front of such a human woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure to be mature enough to be strong enough. After she left the king, she kept saying to herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why she stopped the two Pegasus knights to go to the Tower of the Tooth after seeing Abin and Ayimei. Elves are actually far more powerful than humans, but very few people in the family practice elemental magic. There has never been a magical learning condition in this area. And if it has a good relationship with the Tower of Teeth, it seems to be beneficial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elder Luya. There is a strong elemental fluctuation in the south that is approaching here. Very strong magical fluctuations seem to be more than the last three necromancers Be strong.” The Elf Patrol on a tall branch whispered that there was a magical array under him for scouting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What" Luya stunned. She immediately asked loudly: "Can the magical array of the atmosphere be activated now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be used only once. It seems to be used at this time. Delay the length of the birth." The two elves on the other side replied. Even the ancient trees of war have not yet grown. But some special magic arrays and functions on the old trees are already available. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Open it anyway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
