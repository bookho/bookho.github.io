			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good news." Stephen smiled. He stood up and walked over to the bed and reached out and swept over Javia's head with a black and white magical scent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A long gasping sound came from Javey’s throat and his closed eyes slowly opened. He twisted his neck and looked around and fell to the face of both Hamm and Stephen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Even the city and the calm of Bishop Hamm were shocked. This is definitely not a move that has a mind that has been chaotic as a mess, and that look is less likely to be a mind with no thinking ability and no spirit. He stumbled to the bed and reached out and grabbed Javy's wrist with a cold, non-pulsating touch instead of the magical force flowing in the body. This is not the human body is completely different from the body of the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the physical side, you are absolutely assured that all of my choices were made by Shant’s elaborate ancestors and even the internal organs were used. Many of the secrets I have learned from the East can't be better than me if I personally come. I now say that your son's body is the strongest of the 6 big ones. This is the crystallization of the highest magical skills. "Stephen pointed to the corners of the body, the various muscles of the bone marrow and the internal organs were completely decomposed to the tiniest level. Like a bunch of the most brilliant butchers, only the two heads are still intact. Out of the original owner's appearance. The fierce face of Hilika and the look of Rhodes Hart are now lying quietly on the ground like the heads of two sculptures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?" Inham looked at Javey. At this moment, his expression is different from that of the past. No matter what the bishop's Necromancer, and so on, the breath of the mantra, the man who is behind the scenes, and the black-handedness of the dark hand, can't feel a little bit from him. There is no difference in the number of fathers in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know what kind of mood I saw on the side of him. Stephen couldn’t help but smile a little. This is also different from the smile he has just hung on his face. The same is true from the heart. But this smile did not bring much goodwill in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javie just nodded and did not speak. Even this is enough for a son who can understand and nod to be satisfied with Ham. It’s just that Jia Wei’s eyes still reveal confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephen regained that very ordinary smile and shrugged his shoulders and said: "A little bit short of regrets. These two Necromancers have no voice to your son's original It was also unusable by Sandro, so he can't talk now and then go up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did his mind recover?" Hamm turned and asked if this was his biggest concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephen smiled lightly: "The power of Purdue sentient beings is really out of my expectation plus the white magic in his own body. I think A way to use the power of the Necromancer to deliberately eroded his spirit and the brain to induce the power of the Purdue beings to attack. Sandru's technique I am still familiar with his skill in the operation of the body, I can't match it but the spirit and the brain. The ministry is worse, at least I can make up for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That can be..." Inham slowly nodded. The reason why White Magic's treatment is ineffective against Jarvis's injury is that from a certain point of view, he is not hurt but is distorted by Sand's uncomfortable technique. If there is a person who is familiar with Sandru's technique and can be similar to Sandru in the control of magic, then he can use the miraculous healing power of Purdue. This seems to be the only way to not use the leaves of the world tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I have to apologize to you. This method is very risky. Once the Pudong sentients stop on my way, it may be irreparable. I didn't have time to find it. You discuss that I think you should have remedy measures and take a chance to try your luck." Stephen seems to be embarrassed. "I'm sorry to have disrupted your plan. In fact, should you have a better way to restore his mind? I am advocating this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stephen Teacher, I really want to thank you." Inham slammed to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is there a little bit of a sequela..." Stephen hesitated and said slowly. "You know the effect of mana erosion... Although there are Pudu sentients to make up for it, he may have some influence on the memory of the past... Of course, I promise that he will be absolutely awake as usual."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephen nodded and smiled and said: "There is a very interesting religion in the Far East. There are some sayings that people's troubles are actually remembering too many things and forgetting to let go of real peace and happiness."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, maybe." Because Hamm nodded and looked at Javey. Jia Wei still lying in bed just looking at the two with a confused look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is still very weak now, but as long as he has enough magic power, he will recover soon. It is not just the Necromancer that uses the Purdue. After the transformation, you need a huge white magic to drive the body. After all, the body of the Necromancer itself is driven by the mind of a normal person. It is no longer possible to use only the magic of the dead spirit. You can find a pastor and a priest to put their magic power. It’s all right to deliver to your son.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a bit embarrassing to say that I’m arrogant about myself. Stephen thought about it and said, “Well... if you’re not at ease You can wait a little while to see how he is recovering. Until you are sure that there is no problem, it is not too late to give it to me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No need." Because Hamm put his hand into his arms and took out a scepter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephen’s expression has not changed but the eyes are already in the light. There is a clear crack in the center of the cane. It can be seen that the two halves are temporarily together. Stephen recognized it very much. This is what he always wanted. The faint volatility that emerged after the two pieces were closed could not be derived from anything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Hamm handed out the scepter and took it back. It seems that he is not completely relieved and asks again: "Stephan teacher... you are sure. He is completely Okay? What will happen in the future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Absolutely not. You can rest assured." Stephen smiled confidently but he didn't Seeing that since Hamm had taken out the scepter, his eyes had been stuck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you said this. Then I can rest assured." Inham nodded and smiled and handed the handle to Stephen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephan reached out and took the scepter. His hand was actually shaking like a boy who touched the lover for the first time. "Unfortunately, the king's ring has already fallen in Magnus's hand and has been shared by the ruined family for four times. I am afraid that it has already consumed up the power. Otherwise, the two treasures of the 6th strongman of the year can be In my hand, I reunited into one..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His words came to a sudden stop here. His hand is still shaking and the more he is shaking, the more his body is shaking his face. His other hand was steep but a black magical wave converges on the edge of the palm of his hand and traverses his right hand holding the scepter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?" Because of the slightly surprised color on Ham's face, his hands were out of control and the extremely clever force shield blocked Stephen's left hand. Stephen's hand was in the air, but the knife-like black breath on his hand flew out and still slammed into his right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white light of a purifying operation flashed from the hand of Hamm and collided with this black gas, but was immediately smashed by the black gas. Because Hamm kept playing with both hands. A group of white light illuminates between the two at a dense frequency, and finally dispels the black breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, because Hamm’s hand has let go of the handlestick, the only one holding the cane is only Stephen’s hand, but he is desperately trying to break it. This only holds the hand of the scepter and Hamm tries to stop him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Stephen screamed. His original, slim and elegant look is now completely distorted. Now all is fear and anger. The murderous and intertwined ray of light seems to be a full-fledged scholar's eyes now like a wolf desperately struggling in the trap. It’s not his hands but the whole body that is now flashing black. The black magic wave that wraps around him has turned into dozens of dark blades that are intertwined with his core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Hamm has already flew back and picked up the bed, Javy has rolled over and has already reached the corner of the basement and pushed the bed In the presence of both of them, he seems to be not enough. The wreckage of the two dead spirit knights piled up in the corners all flew over and fell into the bed and instantly pieced together into a weird shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a huge squeaking noise in the entire basement. Not all of the things within a few tens of meters of the basement are all cut like cheese by the black blade-shaped magic flying blades. The buildings above all become pieces and collapse. The dusty bricks and tiles splashed into the ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
