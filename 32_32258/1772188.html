			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't want to die, come over and help stop the two churches. You can still get it." Asa shouted to the Hilton in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hilton three heard the words immediately. Druid also turned into a werewolf again. Although Lancelot had said that he was not interested in them, it was just a talk. Moreover, the guy dressed behind the cardinal may be the one who really has the authority. For the church, both the Druids and the Black Elves are absolute pagans, and most of the Neil's black elves are more evil than the Orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Boss, you have been pretending to be really high. I said that even if the Paladin is not able to put you down, it is a pity. I didn’t take the opportunity to kill one.” Hilton held two fists and waved a few sacred warriors to the opposite templar. This is a simple-minded guy who heard Asa’s greeting and immediately came over and certainly didn’t think about anything. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled a bit, but in fact, the sword of Lancelot was sent to the body after the sword's vindictive mixed magic, but his body could not move at all. The mind and senses are not damaged. He also wanted to use meditation to crack this kind of cockroaches. Unfortunately, the power of this vindictiveness is not only clever but also powerful and powerful. He can't dispel it with all the power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But until the Lancelot trio began to fight against Cedrus, there was a feeling of not knowing where to come from. The feeling is very strange, very slight, very lively and very familiar. It is followed by the body immediately resonating with this feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not where you have feelings and changes, but every subtle place in your body has that kind of vitality. Like an invisible tree, the buds are growing in each of his cells. The power of the mix of vindictiveness and magic that originally occupied the body is rapidly disappearing. That is not dispelling but assimilation. Those who lived in the body absorbed Lancelot's vindictiveness and magical powers, and his body immediately restored his freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change is only born in his own body. The outsider can't see the difference at all and no one will notice him lying on the ground. So he had a chance to repel him in the absence of Christine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone will stop and listen to me." This voice shouted for the third time. Asa glanced at the original elf elder Lloyd. He was next to Luya, who was holding the leaves of the world tree, and the female elf patrol carrying the black longbow. The three men led the elves to have been surrounded by a group of people who were in full swing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, nothing for the Knights of the Shrine and the Cardinals is more valuable than removing or grabbing the opposite. After all, it seems that the advantages of their side are obvious. So they didn't mean to stop. And Cedrus hasn’t relaxed his ear to listen to anyone’s words. At this time, the eagles of the elder elders seemed to be exceptionally weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s completely unresponsive, Lloyd’s face doesn’t seem to be flustered or overwhelmed, and his eyes are constantly moving between the two sides. The female patrol next to him whispered. On the other hand, Luya looked at the anxious look on their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s eyes fell on the leaves of the world tree in her hand, and he understood that he had just let him out of Lancelot’s armpits. The feeling is coming from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adra stood up and wiped the sweat from the forehead. Even with his large white magic level, he spent a lot of effort with several Templars to control the injuries on Edric. He looked at the situation on both sides and smiled coldly. Even he can see that the fighting power of both Sedros and Gru has been almost exhausted, although he also hurts one of the Knights of the Temple. Lancelot also took a lot of effort, but after all, there are two Shrine Knights. More important is to have yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of cardinal in combat is absolutely beyond doubt. But just a few rounds are too fast. And he hasn't put his spirit into battle yet. First, a fire wall splits the line of sight and then the rabbits are smashed and the shadows are suddenly mixed. The time is just a few blinks. And now he is already guarded by the whole world, even if he only relies on paralysis, it is enough to easily control the situation. He did not mourn the curse, a white light, flowing in his fingers like mercury, and the white magic that has been gathering for a long time is coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s just a short breather, it’s enough to restore a little magic to the level of the Sedros magician. He looked intently at the same white magical glow in Adela's palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
