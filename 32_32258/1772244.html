			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you waiting for?" "What are you going to do?" The ministers looked at Asa and screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said it is someone who can explain the vernacular to me. Please rest assured that it will not be delayed for a long time." Asa replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone dares not move. The man’s two hands are still placed on the neck of the prime minister and the queen, and the strength of his presence and the two large living beings are shields in front of him. No one can take the prime minister and the queen from his hand. Save it. Although the ministers did not know why this person had hijacked the prime ministers and queens who had been helping him, but knew that they could not be harmed anyway. Even the slightest may not work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt and Javey are all aware. Both of them know that in fact, Asa can never hurt the two of them but they still can't move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if they do know it, they can’t show it. After all, it's not that they can do exactly what they want. The rest of the people here are loyal empire ministers. They can command the Paladins and do not mean that the Paladin is the machine in their hands. These people are under the command and control of them because they are the two of them. They are the cardinal of the people of Zemin. They are also the loyal and loyal members of the Paladin. If they show that this identity is completely unknown. The influence of attempting this identity is completely absent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Asa did the reason. Nature is also directed at them. I have to say that this method seems very weird but it is very real and effective. This is indeed the most effective way in such a situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think you will use this method... I have to admit that you seem to be smarter than I imagined." Bishop Javey slowly said that his eyes are coming. The colder and even the unconscious cold light. Although the situation is still under control, he vaguely feels a strange taste of a derailed taste. These tastes made his nerves suddenly start to get nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it smarter?" Asa looked at Bishop Javey and smiled and said: "Do you think everything is in your hands? I tell you The bureau has broken." He turned to look at the ministers and said with a smile: "Please rest assured that as long as you don't mess up. The prime minister and the queen will not have anything. I just want everyone to wait for a long time." Maybe at any time, I guarantee that the Queen and the prime minister will be safe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people standing around the cardinal felt the air in his body cold. Cold shrinking seems to have a myriad of sharp ice needles scattered from his body in the surrounding air to puncture and kill each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait? Waiting for someone? Rescue? Impossible." Jia Wei smiled, but this smile was a bit hard and sharp. He took a lot of effort to suppress his almost explosive pressure. The smile on the opposite side of the face made him look extremely uncomfortable. He feels that the confidence of the other person's expression of self-confidence is above all the ground in his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The results of people who think they are in their own hands are usually not good. Have you forgotten?" Asa replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes and hands of Bishop Jia Wei twitched nervously. He felt a long-lost violent impulse to hit in his chest. I can’t wait to rush to the top and punch the arrogant face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was shocked. This impulse seems to be the time when he was the same identity. Since having the current identity and name, he has already abandoned all of the previous ones, but now it has appeared again. And all this is because of this person in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A larger, more turbulent anger and murderousness suddenly swept. Almost impossible for him to control himself. This is the hysterical killing after feeling the horror and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have not been completely defeated by me? How come now again here? Still laughing at me with such a self-confident look? Why do I still have the impulse to suppress before? Is it because I seem to feel that you are standing on top of me again? It’s absolutely impossible not to do this kind of thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I thought that I had already passed the previous realm and indefinitely despised my former self, I suddenly seemed to be going back to the prototype and returning to the contempt. The horror and anger that comes out of the state is even more unstoppable than when he is faced with any new environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhodeh whispered his head and replied softly: "What if he really used them as shields? Even if we decided that he didn't dare, the other captains didn't think so. If my teacher is here, they will listen to the order." But now they will have concerns in this situation...not necessarily able to command..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are always a few hands-on. He can let go of both of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If this is true, regardless of their lives and deaths, but even if we succeed, the ministers will be wary of us. And the suspicion. The key is that if the people of these Paladins have doubts, then our advantage will be completely gone... Anyway, you said that Sandru is already dead and my teacher is unknown, but it should not come back in a short time. It’s not as good as us...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Give me it right away.” Jarvie’s voice and expression are out of control at the same time, an impulse that has never been seen before. It is floating up. This voice and expression are not aimed at Rhodes Hart but a sudden explosion and venting, so others have seen and heard it. The swordsmen and ministers around him were surprised to see him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rod gave the special first look at him more amazed. Then slowly resumed the usual stability and did not say anything but just slowly nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong? Bishops, do you want them to be forced to shoot? Do you care about the safety of the prime minister and the queen?" Asa also saw Jawi. He was somewhat surprised by the anger that was almost out of control on his face. This does not seem to be the style that this person should have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know if you will hurt them." Jarvi took a long sword from the swordsman next to him and pointed to Asa. The white light on the sword is not heavy again. It is only a short period of time that has almost completely recovered. He laughed. As the dam intercepted the Yangtze River, the sword was accumulating in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to spell even if it does make his identity hurt. But the other party has to let go and have to take care of the lives of both of them. Even if this situation is chaotic, at least it can keep the situation intact. To ensure that this situation is still intact, it has not been broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the surrounding ministers all started to scream: "The bishop is not good, please stop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp A&#;&nbsp;Asa frowns at the horrible cardinal frowning and said, "How do you know that I will not hurt them? Don't you know that I am the Big Six first wanted criminal? That murder is like a devil?" Or do you know something that you don't know about it? Or you are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No language to answer. The answer to him was the sword in the hands of the cardinal. The sword instantly became the Asa Thorn that stood in front of the white light that converges on the Yangtze River and the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If purely technical. Demeanor and spirit. This sword is naturally not as good as the sword that the Cardinal had just rushed into, because the sword was the same person, but the mentality of this person has completely changed. But the violent murderousness and killings contained in this sword make this sword more difficult to resist than the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the goal is only Asa, but the sword’s murderous murder is already in the past, no matter what the front is, whether it is the mountain or the wall, as long as it is in this sword The trajectory is also in the killing of this sword. And the little sisters and queens in front of Asa are naturally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time, when the swordsman was just out, there were also four swordsmen who pierced half from different angles in the four different directions. On the way, the confluence hit the sword of Bishop Jiawei. A sword-shaped blade slammed into each other in a very short space and then stopped the five swords together. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These four swordsmanships, although there is no such thing as a singer in the hands of the cardinal, they are still impeccable. The four swords were matched just right, so the sword of the Cardinal was stopped without any damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four swords are the captains of the four Paladins. The purpose of their swords is naturally obvious. Before the sword of the Cardinal, the spirit and murderousness of the sorcerer and the ‘salvation’ concept are unrelated. Although they are nominally subject to the command of Bishop Javey and Rodhart, the object of total loyal obedience is only the head of Roland. And they are all clear-minded people who know the sharpness at this juncture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
