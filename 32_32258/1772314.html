			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the high platform of a rock wall on the edge of the city, the thick and thick voice of the Tauren is singing in a strange tone, screaming in the air. The screams of screams can't cover up this strange singing. On the contrary, it seems that it is equipped with the most suitable background music. This is the song of hell, calling the song of hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tima High priest held his hands high, like a singer in a historical poetry, sings in a singer and sings with a sharp voice. The huge and unparalleled elements fluctuate in a specific way with his prayers, and the resonance acts in the direction of his hands, the top of this huge cave space. The eternal rock top began to lava under the undulations of massive elements and fire elements, and then collapsed by itself to become a deadly fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not seen in any conventional magic books or records. In the end, it seems that it is just using the earth fire magic to slowly heat up a group of areas, soften and soften The surface layer, it seems that it is not a magic, the effect is another matter. This is not a comprehensive curse of meteor fire in the fire system, but if it is only about destructive power and damage, this spell is not weaker than the legendary spell. The elf city in the square is gradually becoming a ruin in the constant impact of the explosion. The Black Elf Warrior and the Archer are rushing here. However, around the high platform, the Tauren warriors emerged from the channel alongside the tide. In all directions, the eyes of the evil eye and the harpy are also constantly floating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top dark elf warriors have already rushed to the high platform, but none of them can climb the high platform. The evil eyes floating in the air burned the most cutting-edge fighters into coke from the light in the center of their own eyes. The hens are not eager to attack, but they are circling around the high platform. Once the black elves that have leaked from the evil eye are approaching, they immediately embrace like a large group of flies. Even if the combat power of these warriors is usually not weak, under the siege of dozens of hens, only the pieces of broken meat are broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black elf archers have only shot a few eagle owls in sporadic arrows, and there are dozens of Tauren warriors around the Tima priest as guards. . Those rock-solid muscles are more effective than any shield, and the toxins and curses on the arrows do not work at all under the magical purification of the Tauren Sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sneak attack that has already been planned. Even the terrain is early in the arrangement. The high platform was originally used by the black elf's own scouts, but now I don't know when it became the place where the Tamar priest was cast. And the Tauren and the eagle are everywhere. Evil eyes are also well-organized, even more efficient than against the army of Elazia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of family is the git, patrol of the squad? Even so many Taurens can't find it? I want to use them all as a sacrifice. Product." Cuihana mother is still screaming. Looking at the emerging army, she already understood what was going on, but she still couldn't believe it and didn't want to believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The savage monsters of the Tauren have been unwilling to succumb to the underworld, and are overridden by any other race in the eyes of these legendary abyss demon monsters. It is not tolerated at the top of the head. The kind of spurred factor has been rooted in the beliefs and barren culture of these monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, although there is no fixed order in the Nigan, the law of the strong is universal in all places, although the strength of the black elves themselves It is not enough to completely overwhelm other races, but unlike the tauren's vain belief, the beliefs of the black elves are more real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shadow of the Dragon Maratha is indeed the same as all other demon demons, there is no real world and there is no real miracle available. But one of her children, the great Moriel, did exist in Nigan. Enshrined and worshipped by the black elves. It is by relying on the power of this spokesperson of the gods that the black elves have always faintly occupied the dominance of Nigen. The small friction between races is common in the underground world of Nigan, but no one race dares to fight all-out with the Black Elves. Only the eye-devils of the early days, this kind of Nigan aboriginal monster like the cave man challenged the authority of the black elf. But then the evil eye tyrant smouldering under the anger of Moriel, and the battle between the two monsters extended the space of the underground world of Nigan,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp So far, I can see the traces of the expansion of the underground world of Nigan in many places. In this huge battle, even the entire eye-devil tribe was cleared and almost destroyed, leaving only some low-level evil eyes to survive. This is a perfect example, and the Tauren and other races are savage and untamed in the face of strength and self-knowledge. Even in the past few decades, a tall priest appeared in the Tauren, and the original scattered tribes were unified and governed in a well-organized manner. The strength has already fainted the trend of the black elves, but they did not dare to It has changed, even more than ever, to maintain tolerance for the Black Elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
