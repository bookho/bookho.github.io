			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This robes was given to him by Sandro. It was dirty and smelly. It was originally thrown there to cover the body and actually asked him to use half a year of work to mortgage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asaben thought that Sandro was just not talking about it. But he never cares what he wears. As long as he is not cold, he can't see what color it is, but the robes he has never put on his body. Fortunately, he did not change it. He now knows that this robes actually only makes half a year of hard work and it is really profitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he just fired a fireball at his waist, he was already ready to be injured. But the fireball blasted the clothes without any damage. He immediately knew why he was not hurt when he suffered the magic outside the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dragon spit out the green inflammation, he had put his hands and feet into the robes as much as possible. It is also the same as when I was outside the forest. I felt the devastating magical power around me, but I was not hurt. I just fell from the tall shoulders of the tree and was buried in the ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the ugly laughter of the red robe, he raised his head slightly from the ashes and saw that the red robe was walking towards the spring. He can see that the three leaves in the spring are what they have been looking for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly jumped out to grab the leaves and escape? Absolutely not waiting for him to run out of this open scorched earth, a ball of light will blow up on his back. The only way to do this now is to have a preemptive person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red robes have already killed all the instinctive tree-man elves. Now, just rush out and kill the red robes in the pool of water. It is. He also saw that the magic just made the red robe people consume a lot. If you want to deal with the red robe, now is the best chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knife fell on the grass outside the forest. Asa saw the corner of a unicorn on the ground. The green fire even put all the bones of the unicorn. It was made into ashes but this corner was not damaged by the slightest. So he jumped out of the ashes and grabbed the corner and rushed toward the red robe. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the red robe saw Asa’s lively jump out of the ashes, he was even shocked when the cavalry saw the body standing up. But his eyes immediately fell on the robes of Asa's body and he immediately understood what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he shouted: "Wait a minute"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is never willing to wait Something. This robes are flames that can withstand magic and may even be able to withstand other magic but this is still a very soft robes and it is impossible to get rid of it. He just saw how the ball of the red robe was smashing the smashing of a huge tree. It was not even necessary to hit him directly. It would be enough to blast him apart. He can't wait for the red robe to accumulate magic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red robe man’s movements are not fast, but he barely escaped Asa’s first attack, but his mouth was squatting down to the sharp corner. The skin next to the mouth fell off but did not bleed to reveal only the dark teeth and bones inside, as well as some dry muscles attached to the grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa has been a little panicked. The first time he didn’t penetrate the other’s head, as long as the red robe is left with magical power, the time is now enough for him to come together. It is. Asa is not your death, but the power of my death is desperate to use all the power to rush into the arms of the red robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You listen to me" Red robes are back. Even when he spoke, the teeth under the face did not move directly from the throat. He is very flustered. The golden light in the spring has become more and more lively. The elf girl standing in it is like a gold-painted artwork. If you don’t go, you can’t catch up. The red robes forcefully squeeze their voices out of their throats: “I am”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound just stopped halfway and stopped the unicorn The corner pierced from behind his chest and put out all his movements and language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Asa’s face showed an incredible look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horn of the unicorn did penetrate the body of the red robe. It should be through his chest muscles from his fourth and fifth ribs and slant through the left lung through the heart and then rub the right lung and then from the back muscles. This is definitely a deadly part. But he didn't feel any feeling that he should feel from the hand. He didn't pierce the ** and then broke the body to penetrate the tissue. It just seemed to be stuck in a cage. Like touching some branches of hay and even slipping through a glassware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
