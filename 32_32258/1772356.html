			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it still impossible to do now?" Going out of the cell, Lancelot asked the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the most important thing is to borrow the power of the Glorious Castle for hundreds of years, but the summoning angel still consumes too much power in the ring. Can extract his vitality intact...but as long as the ring in the Glorious Castle should not take long to recover."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope shook his head and gasped. . "So he can live more carefully and don't let him commit suicide. Although he doesn't look like a suicide..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talis The Cavaliers have applied to me and hope that he can complete the final step of the plan... She will take the extracted vitality and hilt to Oufu..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Is you telling her about her plan? No wonder..." The Pope was surprised. "But this kind of thing...except you and me, I really shouldn’t let other people know what you are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please rest assured that she knows how to be light She has chosen her own choices, so she will make the request to me..." Lancelot’s face is not sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, that's right. I can see." After a long silence, the Pope nodded his face and was gratified. "It's hard to be her. She is a good boy... I know she must have made a lot of determination. The choice for the sake of the future of the big 6 is a very strong and weak child. Completed. After this mission, her pure soul will surely go to heaven..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Simple pure but strong child...will be able to qualify for heaven on her soul The old man who is used to the tricks of our habits is more qualified..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the two did not deliberately depress. The surrounding guards are all tens of meters away and no one dares to eavesdrop here. And here is the Glorious Castle. The two of them are the top players. Whether it is magic or any skill, then the subtle peeping means can't get their feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But their feelings are sharp and they don’t seem to notice that there is a foil on the iron wall in one corner of the steel prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a very thin piece of metal and the same color as the outer wall. And just a very ordinary metal without the slightest magic, so Lancelot and the Pope are not present. If there is any abnormality in this piece of metal, it is connected with a thin gold wire. This gold wire is buried in the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a room in the distant Glorious Castle, this gold line protrudes from the ground and extends to a small metal cylinder on the table. The metal cylinder is like a funnel-shaped cup. The two cardinals look at it strangely. From there it was all the voices in the steel prison, including the dialogue between Lancelot and the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is really no magical peep to win the Pope and Lancelot in the Glorious Castle. Even the eagle eye surgery unique to the Necromancer is impossible. But they didn't use any magic but this is the original way of being simple without magic. This is the props of the Karendo dwarves who transmit sound in the underground pit. Sometimes these little things are far more useful than the mysterious magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of Adela's bishop is like a young man who has just seen magic. It is full of horror and incredible. "What...I don't think...Akibad's adult prophecy turned out to be...I don't believe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the face of Bishop Ham is a The haze, which is difficult to see through, is as thick and heavy as if it were dripping water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for anticipating the preparation of these things. I can’t think of my majesty, even I have to squat... He and Lancelot want to extract that The power inside the kid..." But what does it have to do with the hilt? What else do they have to go to Oufu..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ask other people not to do it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you asking?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I am asking people who can go to heaven... but I think I have to use some way to change things..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dawn, Bolugan received several reports from Celeste. He immediately jumped from the bed that had only slept for three or four hours and rushed to Sedros. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been many reports from Celeste. Every time I report to Sedros, I will treat it with great care. In order to bury these leads on the heart of the church. The energy and cost of the work is very huge, but it is also worthy of the weight of each report. This time is undoubtedly the heaviest because these are the last reports. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rhetoric of the report has the same strangeness. There are a lot of confession mixed in the flustered words. The handwriting is also very confusing. I can see that the person writing the letter is not confused. Very confused. Although there is a lot of confession and apology in the return to the land, the main meaning can still be expressed. They all said that they will never work for Oufu anymore. The money that Sedros received before will be returned or donated to the church for atonement. I hope that the city of Sedros will not look for them again from now on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what reason they dare not betray the great God again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These letters are the same reason. They all said that they saw the miracle with their own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great interest temptation and the greater intimidation are not worth mentioning under the power of faith. Especially the eyes are unquestionable, and people instinctively feel it. Shocking faith. There are many spies in Celeste, but only a few other reports have dared to write. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Angel? Phoenix? Is this something really there? Are these guys having a collective illusion?" Bolugan was extremely puzzled by the bulls eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sedros closed his eyes after watching the report for a long time, and then slowly spit out a breath: "The ancient elf empire has this The summoning of magic is nothing but the magical life created by the blend of natural magic and elemental magic. It seems to be the gift that Moriel gave them... The real phoenix does not exist on the big 6..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This day made this thing... Is there really God in this world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What God? God is also artificial. The angel who wants to come is nothing but the power of the mind to condense the earth." Sedros sneered. "At that time, when I built this capital of faith, the Pope Gerasius I laid a huge magical array on the foundation. It was not far from the Far East. Some strange guys arranged the architectural layout so the Glorious Castle could The human faith is absorbed by the sacred spirits of the worship. Over the centuries, hundreds of thousands of believers have been worshipped and buried in the pope. Each of the hundred Cardinals is white magic. The power that has accumulated over the centuries has turned out to be an angel who can fight against the summoning magic of the ancient elves. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" However, it is impossible to support such a power of arrogance. It is impossible for Magnus to be alone... Did he get the ring of the king of Ai Ruirenal?... Only Deken made a lot of effort. This thing is possible..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The angel of the city, though, what angel is fake. But I think it is not a fake effect on us." The big man pulls the problem back more Qualitative place up. "It's not just that the spies who have spent a lot of effort on us have been inspired..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand what you mean." Sedros long Take a breath. "The loss of the phoenix and the glory of the Angels in the Battle of Angels is not small, but what is gained is the heart of the people... All the religious countries of the West 6 are completely a discus. The cohesiveness of a church. This miracle may reach the peak of hundreds of years. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh... obviously it is artificial to make things that can control people like this... People are really weird things." Bolugan adults shook their heads very much. Feeling like he is not a human being. Sedlos snorted and said: "People are inherently weak things. I am entrusted to give myself an illusory sense of security. In order to maintain this illusory result, I can only take my nose by the illusion that I imagined. This is the common problem of most people who are mediocre in this world. But even if it is very boring and weak, it is the weakness of most people and it is a great force to change the direction of history.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as you take advantage of this opportunity . Celeste can integrate all the power of the entire West 6. This time, both the military itself and the military’s morale are different from the previous one. Unfortunately, the mineral deposits in the Sandefes Mountains have not yet been mined... You first go to the Tower of the Tooth and discuss with Adelaide Masters that there are enough transfer reels in the past. We only have to ask them to come and fight directly... ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
