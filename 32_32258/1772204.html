There is no body temperature, the breath in the heart is all mixed into the rain, and even the muscles of the body bounce back the rain. The same, if I am alone here, I will never be able to show you. Unfortunately, under the eyes of the magician god of the Seya masters, as long as you are still a living person, it is impossible to win within 100 meters of his radius. Shape." Ou Ling stared at the black shadow slowly. At the foot of his feet, Talis had no movement at all. Even the blood that had flowed out disappeared under the impact of heavy rain. Only the shining armor still had the holy white magic light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the black shadow of the corner still has no slightest movement, it seems that there is really no one hidden there, but Ou Ling does not relax. His face is still a sallow scent of his face. It is also a suffocating rain that suffocates into the creek-like water flowing down his face. But the vindictive brilliance on his leather armor and sword is still shining. The faint magical runes are constantly rolling and accumulating at any time and under any circumstances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a silence, Ou Ling some impatiently said: "Don't let go of it. You still have a lot of money, we are very clear, so I am so assured and bold. Kill this chick in front of you. It’s the master of Seia.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Of course.” A voice floating in the air above the body is wrapped in a spherical magic guard. The court magician in the hood floated out of a building with the huge magical eyeball. Now the magic eyeball didn’t stop spinning any more, but stopped the fist-sized pupil and looked at the corner coldly. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic shield that shields all the wind and rain from the magical robes of the outside court magician is dry and clear without a trace of wrinkles and even the face is quiet and natural like sitting Drinking tea by the fire is very different from General Ouling in the heavy rain. There was a smug smile on his face that said to the darkness: "When my magical eyes are focused on one person like this, I can guarantee that I know your current physical condition better than yourself. I may wish to do so. Tell you that your current magical power is only four-tenth of the state of full prosperity. The vindictiveness is five-thirds of the chest. The ribs of the chest are injured. The left arm is temporarily unable to use the combat power. It can only be regarded as the third of the heyday. Aton. The eyebrows of the Seya's magician sighed and sighed. "When we first came to you, your tense and magical powers were not even one tenth. Just just pick up the chick and you will be restored to this in a short time. I love you whether you are a troll."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not a troll, you are like a crow. There is so much nonsense." Finally, a voice came from the darkness, but the voice was not loud. The gas was enough to penetrate the majestic rain and spread to the ears of the two. But there is no other movement besides this sound, it is still a piece of darkness. "I can't figure out that you have already been there. Why do I completely ignore me but I have to start with the chick? Are you not a group?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Ignore you, but you can't run anyway anyway. The beast in the cage can deal with the falling bird that happened to be here just before but can't let her belong. We want to kill this arrogant chick is not For a day or two. It is not a bad thing for Erasia to die more than a few churches. In a sense, we also want to thank you for killing Ashur. Haha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really hope that there will be other people who will hear these words. Then I will kill you if I don't need Lancelot." The voice in the dark sighed. Sorry to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't say these nonsense when someone can hear him." Ouling said impatiently to the magician in the sky. "Don't waste time nonsense, solve him quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the face of this prey that has fallen into the trap, you don't think it is very kind. Is there a very interesting thing?" Seya stunned and shook her head and showed an illuminated magic ball. "Since you are impatient. Just hurry up and kill him. Anyway, the chick has already packed up the people from other places. By the way, let us see what the people who can kill Eszal look like." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at the same time as this magical light ball appeared, the original darkness did not suddenly slam a black shadow toward Ou Ling. Ou Ling and the court magician snorted at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ou Ling was surprised that he did not expect this person to rush to him in such a stupid way and posture. Judging from the sound of the wind, this is by no means a clothing or the like. The key to the eye is that the body is still twisting and it is really solid. And the Seya magician has already determined that the killer is lurking alone here, so this is definitely the one who should be. But this position is neither like running away or even attacking. It is not completely open or open to your body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seya magician in midair is equally astonished but not the same thing as Ou Ling’s surprise. He was surprised that the target in the magical eye that was in harmony with him was not moving at all, but he threw the shadow. This shadow is actually a living ** and seems to emerge from the air and appear there out of the air and then be thrown out by that person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical light ball of the illumination has left the magician's hand at this time and risen to the sky. The white light shines through the heavy rain screen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ouling immediately saw what was pierced by his own sword in front of him. It was not the intended target, not even a person but a person. Spider. The cilia-like cilia on the spider's foot, which is not the limbs but the thickness of the wrists of the eight limbs, is clearly visible. The twitching eight feet were holding him over with a big hug. The green body fluid sprayed directly from the wound and the spider's mouth. If it was really hugged and sprayed on the face by the stinking juice, then he had to cut off his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ou Ling was shocked and slammed his sword and slammed into the cuddle of the spider. And this rain is really too far from the venom that the spider squirts. It was diluted immediately in the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empty spider screams like a chicken-like scorpion and then bounces back to Ouling. But it slammed into a group of rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a rain curtain or a water mass that is a group of people. This group of water was suddenly condensed from the foot of Ou Lingdi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water is everywhere in this heavy rain. It’s all rain. No one can tell if the water has been flowing there or when it has been there. The spider struggled in the water a few times and tried to move the half of the body out of the way. But the water wriggled a few times, and the spider, who was the size of the human, immediately became a quirky bolognese in the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said how the magician quietly lurked for so long beside him. I was so confident in grabbing me that I was quietly summoning these things. "The man who hid in the corner finally jumped out. He used this spider to force Ou Ling to retreat himself but rushed over and grabbed Talis on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it you?" Seia and Ou Ling exclaimed at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light ball in midair is not clear in the rain, but the face of this person has been clearly visible. Although neither of them has actually seen this person, this appearance has long been known as the Big 6. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, after grabbing Talis’s body, his hands immediately burst into a black magical wave and poured into the body of the Knights of the Temple. The light on the shining armor was a bit bleak. It seems that this magical fluctuation has hit each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nether spirit?" Ou Ling and then exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The bishop of Escher is dead in your hands. It is not awkward." The Seya magician nodded and looked up and down this almost legendary character. "You can't even kill other people, even the Bishop of Ronis and the Duke of Mulak, not to mention that it is only the Necromancer that has dealt with the two cardinals who have reached the peak of white magic."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa said nothing but just smiled. This smile is under the heavy rain. It seems extraordinarily different in the eyes of Ouling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ouling frowned and looked at him and asked: "Are you originally a Cedrus's man?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a temporary help for him." Asa replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We thought it was just a trapped wounded wolf that was originally a snake or a poisonous snake." Oling's pair was originally weak and now full of eyes. It is light. "Our luck is good anyway. I remember that your head should be worth 5,000 gold coins to equip a small team of reloading knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thousands of gold coins. Thanks to the name of the murderer who killed the church cardinal in the name of the whistle of the singer, the singer of the singer, the singer of the singer, is thankful. It is very interesting to let the church appreciate it. I am looking forward to seeing Magnus. I personally said to me the expression of the time of thank you." The Seya magician waved the three layers of the rain and the water that just shattered the spider water flowed slowly to Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s eyes jumped. Indeed, as the Seya magician said, no matter how vindictive or magical, he has not reached half of the normal level. Even in the case of a full-fledged situation, he has to deal with these four water giants. He must do his best. And Ou Ling and the court magician can never just stand by and watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he had just picked up a trace of clarity from the chaos, he also noticed that Talis had arrived. Escape is just a vain exposure, but he almost instinctively rolls to the corner where the darkest and least easy to go. In the vagueness, he also understands that standing up and running away is a dead end. It is also a dead end. He simply curls up in the darkness of the corner and uses meditation to control his body and the surrounding environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slow magical fluctuations in the brain gradually began to dissolve into the surrounding thoughts and become faster and faster. This is like a reservoir filled with water. If the water pressure can't rush the dam, but it will continue to move around, it will automatically form other vents. This venting route is also constantly widening and venting. faster and faster. The magical power that melts into his mind gradually merges with the strength of the body itself. Not only does it add to the lost power, but the mind has gradually recovered completely. Even clearer and sharper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the water element in this heavy rain can undoubtedly be able to wave the highest long-range jet of water and even the ordinary wooden shield can easily penetrate. Moreover, the position of these four water elements is not a dead angle to each other and is simply a target. The magical insects that come from the forests of Tula, although there are two or three magical creatures, are no different from the real bugs in front of the elements summoned by this top magic. There is another one that can defeat the Knights of the Temple. A combination of a swordsman and a great magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although knowing that his situation is an absolute disadvantage, Asa is not too flustered. He has not yet reached the point of complete despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he now has an interesting situation. He smiled slightly and looked at Ouling and Seia. "What happened? Don't you get started?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have to worry about the big team. It's coming soon. We are in charge of the command." Ou Ling responded with anger. Although his vindictiveness is still in the most vigorous state, he did not move. The four water elements are just the huge magical eyeballs on the head of the four-way Seiya magician, and they look at Asa without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the killer is someone else they may have already started. But when I saw this opponent, it was the first big murderer of the big six killer. The murderer who once assassinated Bishop Ronis should be cautious. In particular, the rumor that this person used to sneak into the thousands of troops to save people with the strange and vicious necromancer magic has long been unknown. However, when he rushed out, he did not manage anything and went straight to the body of the Knights of the Temple to capture it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glorious warfare on the white magical light is still still, even if it is no longer alive and bloody, Talis, the face is pale and bright, even if it is dead. The horsewoman also seems to have a cool beauty. But as long as it is still in the hands of this person, this original and tall body can become an extremely dangerous magic bomb at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the Demon Master of Deya Valley, no one knows enough about this kind of magic, even if it is the Eliyasia Court Magician. Although the Magic Eye can clearly feel the magic power of this opponent and there is not much left, it is impossible to see what kind of Necromancer he can use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a person facing an unknown poisonous insect. Although this poison has already been dying, people still don’t want to go easy. What is the most dangerous poison is that it is unclear that the toxicity and virulence are only vaguely aware of the ‘very dangerous’ attribute of the worm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So neither Ou Ling nor Seia is moving, as long as there is a large number of reinforcements immediately after waiting a little, the two are not willing to take a nap The danger of Necromancer is to take the initiative, even under such obvious advantages. They are all highly weighted people who are qualified and need to be cautious about letting others make cannon fodder. It is enough to hold him cautiously and not to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa also saw their intentions and he suddenly smiled again. He moved the body of Talis in his hand and said, "If I tell you that this Knight of the Templar is not dead, can I let her live? Are you two, have patience and other people to come?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of this sentence is not big, but it is just mixed in a thunder and rumbling to the ears of Ou Ling and Seia. The face of the Seiya magician instantly changed. The face of a pale Ou Ling is even more yellow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
