			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika is sitting in his secret room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special chair just accommodates his huge body like a bear. The muscles of the body are as close to the body as the shovel, making him look like a muscle fortress. Hundreds of different sizes of wounds are intertwined on each of them. Each of these shows that the body is a property that has not been modified under the baptism of blood and sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is forty-five years old this year. This should have been the age of the beginning of a recession but there was no trace of a slight change from him to the old. His energy is still very high. The money is against women. Even stronger than when he was young. The thing that squats high now is evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fingers 搓* holding a gold coin. The smooth and cool touch of the gold coin is so beautiful. He can even tell the color of this gold coin that was cast in the early days of the Erasian dynasty. The incomparable flexibility of the hard and unique gold is far more enjoyable than the woman's **. This feeling can touch the deepest mark in his heart that has been deposited in the soul for the past 40 years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mother gave him the most important lesson in his life when he was four years old. He sold him to a baron for such three silver coins. Seven years later, he was sold to another old viscount who liked a child with the price of a gold coin. After three years of preparation for the forbearance, he found the opportunity to kill the oldest son who had raped his daughter and grandmother in the most brutal way and fled with all the money he could collect. The nobility gave him a wanted order and his remaining life revolves around the killing of money. The world around him has always been converted from money to flesh and blood. Often he has finally found the truth of this world: all things can be converted with the golden little things. It is equal to having the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all his spirits and thoughts have since been rotated in front of this little thing. So much so that when he looks at things, he often creates hallucinations. Everything is built up by jumping coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten years later, when he killed the eleventh elite knight who chased him, he felt that he had the ability to have a place in Elazia. So he formed the Shamuthi thief group and the enclave became the largest thief gang in Erasia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strictly speaking, the Shamuthi thieves group does not have much to do with thieves. It's just that people just want to call them a group that is simply kind and peaceful to them. Under the leadership and command of Hilika, robbery and kidnapping as mercenaries as killers are all business areas of the Shamuthi thieves. As long as you can finally get the golden coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this month, the little things that make him dream like this suddenly add thousands more. To be precise, the bill on the table in front of 4,307 gold coins is clearly written. The word is the same as Axis's disability. But the meaning of the implication of the font still makes the word more touching than any woman's ** to make him hungry and mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a huge sum of money to buy a small city. Even if you look at the whole big 6, no gang can have such a large income in such a short period of time. The five female elves have sold hundreds of gold coins. The most beautiful one is in the auction, and several of the dudes have been carried to more than a thousand goods that can rarely have such valuable value. Having an elf slave is not just a mere sensual beauty and a fresh sense of excitement. It is a symbol of status. Several aristocrats have almost become obsessed with these female elves. They even paid a lot of gold coins to the thieves to book more elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you make a big ticket for this kind of business, Shamuhi thieves can jump in the big 6 regardless of strength or prestige. As long as you think of the mountain-like gold coins, you can compete with the king's strength. Helicia’s heart is boiling in the blood. During this time, he was in extreme excitement almost every moment. In the past week, eight women were killed by his life in bed. But no matter how much more beautiful women are, they can't relax and cool for a while. He can be sure that if he can't achieve such a desire, he will madly explode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three prostitutes next door are already dying, but his stuff is still a pillar of the sky. The fire in his heart is still burning and burning. He is waiting for someone who can extinguish him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened Axis and limped in. Compared with the huge body of Hilika, he is thin and short. He seems to be just a grass or a broken hay. He has only one hand and one foot can move the facial features of the face and twisted. Only a few sparse heads on the broken head look like a magnified goblin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aisisi took a robes in his hand and looked at a succulent Helicika and the sigh of something that he almost had to put up on the table. He threw the robes to Helicika and said, "Set it up." That gentleman should not like you like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest scar on the face of Helica’s face is shaking and the color is red and red is like a climb. The bounce on the face jumped. He paused and spent a little bit of effort to calm down and slowly picked up his robes and put them on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Axis watched him wear his clothes before he went out. After a while, he walked back again and made a beating gesture in the awkward position. He made a gesture of greetings with the kind of compliment of the doorman at the entrance of the big hotel: "Please come in." Our head has been waiting for you for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The person did not express his politeness and went straight in without a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pace is very steady but still reveals the peculiar delay of the elderly people. It can be seen that this is a very common but the body is still very good. Old man. The thin neck looks so weak that the Greek card can be sure that it will not be more difficult to break it than to twist a chicken neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn’t even try to try it. The silver mask on the neck is enough for anyone to calm down. The shape of the skull of the mask is exceptionally different under the light. The light reflected above is not the bright color of ordinary metal, but the delicate and soft luster of the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait for a long time. Please sit down." Helicia has forgotten the last time he used his polite tone to talk to people. Because of the unfamiliar and unbearable excitement and hoarse and dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of eyes behind the mask swept him and nodded slightly and said in the same hoarse voice: "I am very busy without a guest. Let me say it as soon as possible." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika said: "The scrolls and maps you gave me last time are very useful. We successfully used them to sneak into Trauli." The elves gather in the forest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then." The old man behind the mask asked faintly. "Do you find what I want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. We are not prepared enough. And we are underestimated in the actions of the elves and have not seen what you said. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I heard that you have caught five elves and changed a lot of gold coins." The old man's voice is very cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are a lot of magicians in those elves. We died four people." Helicka's throat and the nose were as low as an animal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said it. The elves you can catch are treated as rewards for your actions. But don't forget what I told you." Speak slowly. "Use the money you get this time to find more help. In any case, you have to complete this in two months. I have no patience and more time."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whistling sounds in the chest of Helica have increased ten times in the secret room. The scar on his face shook as if he wanted to jump. Aisisi’s face twitched and said, "I know that there are thousands of elves in the forest of Tula Leone. And they have lived there for hundreds of years and even the magic circle has been built. Big 6 is the biggest elf settlement. They are all natural archers and a few sorcerers..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know so I didn't Letting you take over the Tula Leone is just to find something for me. As a support, I will give you this one." The old man took three reels from his arms and placed them on the table. The three scrolls are different in appearance and appearance, but the same is true that the top of the scroll has a small purple enamel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the three reels and the little purple beggar above, Aisisi trembled as if a ghost saw it. The same is true of the peerless beauty. When he was at the School of Magic, he specialized in the identification and production of magical items and saw what it was like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One is still the kind of scroll that can crack the enchantments of the elves, and the other two are a wide range of magic to help you fight the wizards of the elves. The scrolls are believed to be very helpful to you." The old man paused and said a little. "In other words, this is the last chance I gave you. I hope you don't let me down." The old man faintly said and took out a transfer reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man turned his head and the gaze under the mask fell coldly on Aisi's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axis muscles that are still moving can be twitched immediately. I don’t know if it’s because of excitement or fear, stuttering: “I’m not thinking about it. I just admire your high magical art. I hope you can point me to that. That’s all. Although you can do anything, I can help. You solve a lot of trivial things, I only ask you to be able to....can..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you have finished this, let's talk about it." The old man left this sentence to expand the scroll Disappeared in the blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axis has become more distorted when he is excited about his ugly face. It took a while for me to slow down and walk to the table and watch the four reels in the eyes of the saints when they looked at the miracles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this old man really talking about the Necromancer?" Helikus suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is of course." Aisisi subconsciously looked around and whispered to answer that it seems that the taboo of the taboo would be noticed by the old man. "Did you not see the mask? It was the most expensive dense silver made of permanent infiltration to reinforce the magic. And these three reels..." His dry fingers stroked the scrolls on the table, fingers and sounds were slightly Trembling is like a teenager who first came into contact with a lover. "There are two big scrolls that are all magical. It's the same art of magic as the scroll that enchanted us last time. And the magic material needed to make such a scroll... Actually there are fragments of stars... Oh my god... that is not what gold coins can buy at all.” Aisisi sighed and sighed and praised the hymn: “Which world can be apart from the Devil’s Guild in Deya Valley? There is such a high art of magic in such a large handwriting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika stood up. The chair he had just sat on immediately dissipated the broken wood that became a place. He looked at the spot on the face where the old man had just stood. It seemed that he would jump up and choose someone and swear by him. "If you don’t look at the money, I just tore the old man." Fragmented. I hate people talking to me in that tone. Whether he is a human or a ghost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, you didn't do that or we are really ghosts." ..." Ai Sisi whispered to himself and said to himself about the temper of this boss. He has always been a headache. "You don't know that the necromancers of Deya Valley are the ones who really stand at the top of this world are not the same as ours. Otherwise, how can people put those elves who are worthless in the city to let you make money? They must Is there any scruples and what is not convenient to come out personally? This is cheaper for us..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don’t care what they have and what they do I just need to know what I can get." Helica looked very hard at Aisi and the three reels. His voice was hot. "What do you think these three reels can bring to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aisisi thought for a reply: "These three reels are used even better. It’s hard to fight the elves in front, but it’s okay to grab the things that Mr. wants and grab a dozen elves.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ..." Hilika grinned and narrowed his eyes and chewed the quantifier. After a while he asked Aisisi: "What magic is sealed in the two reels? What is the effect? ​​How long does the effect last?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Er... this should not be a direct killing magic..." Aisisi quickly picked up the scroll and looked at it carefully. Fortunately, when he was not much higher than the magic level in this respect, he came to a conclusion and reported to the boss with surprise and joy. "Although not sure, these two should be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the instructions of the scroll, Hilica surprisingly did not react. He even calmed down and sat down on his knees and closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Axis quietly watched him not dare to disturb. He knows very well that although this boss is more violent than anyone else, he seems to be more aggressive than anyone else. He seems to be able to rip any opponent at any time. But once there is a need, he can completely quiet down and rationally analyze and then wait for the opportunity with the patience of the more ordinary people. This is a person who keeps the lion's violent temperament at any time but the serpent's cool fox and the scorpion's endurance are hidden in the bottom of my heart. It is not enough for the Shamuthi thieves to become the biggest force in the darkness of Elazia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Axis has been able to succumb to this seemingly rude man. The mind is sometimes very important but the real power is the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
