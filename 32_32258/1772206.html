			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seya*s only confirmed that the two Messiah’s Red Cardinal Church died in this person’s hands. It’s not just luck, it’s because of strength. Strength is not just fighting power, there are more and more subtle places, such as the control of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person’s reaction and skill is first-class, but the observation and control of the battle is first-class. He is able to understand all the situations on the battlefield in the shortest possible time and then use all the factors in the most efficient way. Even the strengths and weaknesses of the enemy can be turned into weaknesses under clever and reasonable arrangements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical eye can understand the situation on the battlefield, even if it is blind in this way. This is Seia and Ouling. The absolute advantage of people. But it wasn't until Seya's voice reminded him that he knew that he should either not speak out or should not be so anxious to remind him. He can see that the situation in the field does not mean that Ou Ling can also see it, and his voice reminder has already fallen into the opponent's expected arrangement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Seia felt the raging fire element, the scroll was indeed unfolding and the magic was already over the limit, but the person holding the scroll did not really The touch is like the arrow is already on the string but it is not shot. This is of course a very magical thing, but it is necessary for the user because he just wants to wait for Seia to feel the wait for the warning to wait for Saia to evade and then shoot out. He deliberately wants to delay the time of these two blinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, I heard the rush of my companion reminding me to flash the Ou Ling and of course I will flash. But he can't see or know what kind of attack. In this case, the only instinctive reaction of the person can only jump up. This is undoubtedly the most common and normal way to avoid, but it is undoubtedly the worst way to dodge a warrior who is highly responsive and responsive. Especially when the opponent he faced was also the martial arts high judgment, he had already predicted his reaction and even arranged for him to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the savvy warrior once leaps into the air, there is no room for borrowing and then agile. This time is no different from a piece of meat hanging in the air. Seia does not understand how this opponent can also see the object under such strong light as his magical eyes, but the dazzling light ball is indeed when the Ou Ling is in the upper air. This is aimed at him, but even the trajectory of his ascending and emptying is already in the calculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Ouling is still on the ground or in this alley, nothing can be seen. But with his skill, perhaps he can evade after feeling the heat wave of the monks. After all, this magic fireball is slower than the front one. As long as it is not hit by the front, Ou Ling's grudge and magic leather armor can still resist the aftermath of the surrounding. But now the light ball that condenses the magical power of a fire master is running in the middle of nowhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the elements of fire, the same elemental creature that is completely immune to fire itself has absolutely no creatures or any object that can survive the top magic of this fire. Although the magical leather armor of Ou Ling is the best of magical equipment, the power of this top-level attack magic can not be resisted even by the fire-fighting guru of a fire master. As soon as he was hit by the first swordsman of Elazia, he would immediately become a group with the leather swords on his body without any suspense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to stop the fire from the top of the fire. All the raindrops are completely vaporized ten meters away from the light ball and then all the other raindrops. Blow open. Changed the smoldering momentum of the light ball. But there were two rain groups that suddenly broke through the momentum and stopped from the bottom up before the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a rain group. It is the water element of Seia's division. Both Seia and Ouling had to scream in their hearts. Fortunately, this magical light ball is not so fast that it can't be reacted. Fortunately, there are two water elements below the Ou Ling and are gathering forces to prepare for the water arrow attack. The Seya Master was just a thought. The two water elements immediately turned all the powers that were ready to shoot the water arrow to the foot and stopped in front of Ou Ling in this millennium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one has tried to use the fire to play on two water elements. These two are the top spells of this department's magic. No master level magician will be bored to do this kind of experiment. But if a basin of water suddenly spills into a pot of red iron, something will happen to everyone. The water contained in these two water elements must not be calculated by basins, and the heat of the fire and the bombs will not only melt a furnace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the general of Ouling who was closest to the center of the storm. Although in the instinctive action, his hands and feet were shrunk into a group of vindictive and magical leather. The full explosion of the airflow did not directly hurt him, but the huge impact still made him like a small one. The puppet rolled over and flew away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seya* is better than the other. He has a few high-level magic shields attached to him and his position is a bit farther. Reducing your height reduces the impact of the waves. Although the same is blown away, the figure can at least maintain balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, although his situation in the air is a little better than that of Ou Ling, his own spirit has already been concentrated to the extreme. The body was driven by the steam storm but his mouth and hands were not free but he chanted the mantra and gestured. Prepared to deal with the steam of the cockroach alone and rushed over the roof to quickly catch up with the opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the lightning in the sky can't break the water vapor in the steam storm. The naked eye can't be any opponent. But in the eyes of the full-fledged magical god, Seia can clearly see a figure that rushes along the power of the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless it is the top air master who specializes in the air system to the limit, otherwise it is impossible to freely manipulate the flight in such a storm, and only the airflow is scraped away. . This point Seya himself knows that the person who chased him is naturally clear, so he has such a heavy murder and killing. This is the only opportunity that must be smothered in the storm of this airflow. This is indeed the only chance to kill one of his advanced diggers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s so clear to see this rushing chaser as a close-up watch of a wolf who sighs at his mouth and opens his mouth. The Asian division is just nervous rather than panic. The court of the Erasia is not a name for the court. In the face of this life and death, his spirit has concentrated on an unprecedented culmination and the magical eye that is closely connected with his spirit. It is the culmination of seeing this oncoming opponent clearly and even the enthusiasm of his body. The magic power is also caused by excessive killing, causing a large number of secretory glands on the kidney and under the brain to infuse hormones into the blood, so that the blood pressure soars and the heart is rushing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s heart does jump very quickly. All his vindictiveness and fighting spirit are mixed up in the body and rushing with the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Tarith is carrying this most aggressive magic scroll, he has arranged all the tactics to make this scroll really Hit the ground. The tactics were almost perfect and almost succeeded, but he still did not expect that Seia could command two water elements in the Millennium to block the violent fire bombs that were sure to be won. This is actually the case after only the water element. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that this is actually only a large-scale storm, it is impossible to kill two top players in the true sense. Although the storm of steam explosion was hot and hot, everyone's body was soaked with rain. Will not be burned. The only thing that comes with this is the opposite of the direction in which the two people separated from the Oulu and the direction in which Seya was blown away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I didn’t expect such a situation, Asa’s judgment was made in an instant. He knew that he had to take this opportunity to put this order and he could not fly freely in the storm. The magician solves it or he can't escape anyway when he replies and continues to use the magical eyes at high altitude. So he even left the comatose Talis. Chasing through the storm of the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is after all the animal wizard of the animal Lasia only sees that he can summon four water elements silently but can use flying Stand in the top of the Big Six's top magician. A reel from Talis has a crystal lens that has been used up. He must use his own power to chase this enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the note of the last spell spitting out from the mouth, a silvery white mist between the hands of Seia rolled out and immediately frozen a large wall out of thin air. General ice crystals. This huge sharp ice crystal is in front of Asa. Generally speaking, as long as the person who knows this magic is willing to touch these things, it is not just the ordinary ice wall with the magic of frozen attributes. The injured person hits it and is usually pierced and frozen into a part of the ice crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chaser knows that this is not known, but he knows that this person will never retreat from the tight muscles of the body. The momentum and the boiling of the blood can be known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that this fight has already consumed about 70%. Seia clearly saw that the vindictiveness of the murderer had changed from a mountain torrent to a few. However, this collision finally did not let the distance between the two of the pursuers to draw a distance that can be attacked. Seia saw the magical power of the body condensed out of the smell of black scent of the dead magic, and then sprayed from the body in the most simple and quick way in a frantic way of fire magic. Then a blue-green rocket appeared in the arrow between the fingers of the man with his body scent. Seia sees the toxins contained in this fire and the power of decay and erosion to kill an elephant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you suddenly face such a hugely lethal but simple and straightforward magic that is not magical, maybe any wizard will panic. Then it will be hit by the arrow-like degree by surprise. But Seya will not see all the action and attacks of this opponent already seen clearly in the eyes of the magic god. Just when the opponent condenses the magic, he is also condensing the power and accuracy of the magic. The ice is blocking the fast-paced blue-green fire, and the blue-green smoke is turned into a steam. The waves are gone without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that this seemingly simple magic consumes 90% of the user’s magic. Half of the magic is used for magic and instant. silent. Seia has to admit that this kind of transformation is actually the most effective. If it weren't for the magical eyes, he could be sure that he had become a burnt stinky meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sia has not slackened because it blocked this attack. Just blocking the hitting ground, he also saw that the opponent had pulled out a small thing from his arms and the birth of the magical fluctuations of the machine was the natural magic of the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment this little thing has already flown from the middle of the opponent and suddenly rises in the air to become a foot and a cellar. However, this cockroach was only directly formed by the chill of the Seiya master. The jelly became a stick and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This method of using insects to store magic is actually similar to making a magic scroll and suddenly using it once to give it a surprise, but it can be awesome. But one is working hard. The magician eyes and the men who have seen this trick have used it for the second time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The airflow has weakened and the two have reached the edge of the storm caused by the steam. As long as they slide further forward, Seia can manipulate the flight to vacate and become completely unable to attack. the height of. But at this time the distance between the two has been shortened to a minimum and it is almost within reach. Asa condensed all the power and strode forward and rushed straight into the air in Seia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if only this last three percent is left. But this punctual punch is absolutely fatal to a magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cover of Seia's body protects the arrow from raindrops but it is impossible to withstand strong impacts and impacts. The circle of the court magician who had been surrounded by the circle was slightly distorted. The mage robe that was immediately shattered in front of this fist smashed and creased in the wind provoked by this fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this punch didn’t really hit the body of the *master, but the flesh of the chest was swept away with a smatter of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You lost." Seia looked coldly at the top of the fallen Asa's head and looked at the pupil that was bigger than the fist. Also coldly watching this falling loser. He did everything he could to use his flying skills to raise his figure a little to avoid this punch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s heart is completely cold and he knows that he has lost. His volley is already a desperate attempt. It is no longer a house but a street and the power of the steam storm has been exhausted. The Seya division will immediately rise. The most important thing is that every attack is completely resisted. Finally, the court magician can use a dangerous approach to avoid his attack. This shows that he really can't knock down a full force. The magician who is fighting with the eyes of the gods. Every move of your own and even the movement of each muscle loses its meaning in any strange and unpredictable tactics in the other's sight. There is no other way than to win with overwhelming strength. His fighting spirit has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the magical eyes still don’t dare to look at the opponent who has already fallen, but the Seiya division has been able to think a little bit at this time. It is. It is a bit of an accident that this person who makes Oling and his own team to deal with it is struggling to fight alone but not his own opponent. But Seia immediately understands that this is also reasonable. Although the two people together are undoubtedly in absolute strength, they have been lax in the spirit and fighting spirit, and this has been stunned by the opponent's use of sophisticated tactics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
