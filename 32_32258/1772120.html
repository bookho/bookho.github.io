			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Calundo Basin is located to the west of the empire's southwestern basin. To the north of the vast mountains is the border of the Bracada Empire and the wilderness. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountains around the basin have actually been the open-air part of the Dwarf Empire Stone Town since ancient times. More than 300 years ago, some humans settled here because they avoided the war and crossed the mountains. In the past 100 years, the mountain road has been excavated because of the commercial exhibition, and it has been nominally attributed to the territory of the Ian Fass Empire. However, strictly speaking here is the territory of the dwarves, so the humans in the Karundo Basin are actually completely autonomous. The long-closed life has kept the boring and rigid atmosphere and lifestyle inside. Like the sky in the whole year, the curtains formed by the coal dust and dust mixed with clouds are groggy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the situation here has changed a lot in the past year. In the wilderness of the Orc City on the rough land, the mountains in the northwest of the basin immediately opened a road. Here the 6 best quality ore and dwarf refined weapons and appliances can be directly exported through the Oufu Chao Quanda 6 and can no longer be exported to the Empire as before. Trade has made the basin booming and prosperous. There is an extra mile to the Oufu empire. The caravans that enter the basin every day have several towns at the entrance to the outer edge of the basin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town in the middle of noon has ushered in a caravan. Merchants and bodyguards, some of the horsemen, sitting on the carriage and riding the horses happily talked about the upcoming orc city. Only the last carriage mountain has two people wrapped in tattered cloaks that are very tired and close together. This is what the two caravans encountered by the caravans on the way to meet them all seem to have suffered a minor injury. It is said that they have encountered the bandit's pursuit. At the cost of their begging and a few silver coins, the caravan promised to take them to Oufu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the caravan arrived at the mouth of the town, a call sign echoed in the clouds and mountains. A dark shadow fluttering from the depths of the basin. The huge black shadow landed on the platform in front of the cave on the hill opposite the village and town. It was an entrance to the dwarf dungeon. There seem to be two or three figures on the black shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most people in the caravan are also the first to see this kind of thing exclaimed. A businessman who has been to Oufu tells you about the strange and huge creatures that this orc is domesticated. The caravan slowly walked into the town. After they took a break here, they entered the Karundo Basin and went through the northern mountain road to Oufu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caravan just stopped in the town. Because the road was blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stuff that blocks the road is very strange or not something but a tea table and two people who drink tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people are an old man and a middle-aged person from the figure and color. They are dressed very ordinary but they are wearing a very cute face. The beautiful silver skull mask completely covers the upper part of the face, leaving only a mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange two people sat here from the morning. The sheriff in the town once came to ask for interference, but the old man just waved his hand and he was thrown up high like a ball and thrown away inexplicably. So no one dared to ask again. The townspeople also escaped far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caravan hesitated in front of the strange two. The leader is an old businessman who doesn't want to have more troubles to look at the two strange masks and the posture to decide to detour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the caravan was ready to turn, the old man sighed and said in a quirky voice: "I don’t want to go out and think about it now. Some people? Unfortunately, even if everyone in this town is willing to be your meat shield, you will never run."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s cold voice is not big But it was clearly passed to everyone's ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responding to him is a crisp female voice from the caravan: "The great God of all things gives me the blessings of your life to drive away evil." And darkness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three green lights shot from the caravan on three trees by the roadside. The strange sound of Kaka in the trees turned thick and then trembled with the naked eye. The sturdy roots of the deformation found out that the three trees on the ground stood up like humans and walked toward the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the two are still sitting. A thick white lightning flashed from the hands of the old man and instantly spread to the three changed trees. The sound of the buzzing of the current and the bursting of the trees and the smashing of the three trees immediately turned into a piece of wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flat, unobtrusive wooden strip that the bow did not shoot out was not too strong, and even the wooden strip twisted itself in midair. But the wood strips are twisting more and more violently twisting. There are also a few branches and even a few green leaves and a full of spikes. It turns into a snake like a living snake. With a strange rattan claws, the old man writhed and rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No arrow can be more lethal than this highly venomous vine. It’s not necessary to shoot as long as the rattan feels the anger of the flesh and blood around it. It will rush to the place and try to get into it. **In the internal organs, the paralyzed venom is attached. Only a strong ogres can't resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man made a sigh of sighs and the tea in his hand poured out the tea and quickly made a small blue fireball. Flying to the vines in the air. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little fireball didn’t even have a big fist, but it’s just a little black ash when it’s not close to the vine. The fireball passed over the ash that the vines left in the air and continued to fly toward the person who shot the arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the man shot a very different arrow, the caravan of the caravan immediately followed another person. After the middle-aged man spilled the flame from the glass, he immediately reached out and had a small ball of diameter. A large-sized fireball flew out from the front of him and took the momentum and commensurate with the volume. He greeted the little pity. The blue flame rushed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loud bang rang in the surrounding mountains. These two fireballs, which are so different in volume and momentum, hit a close match. The houses on the street collapsed with a large flame splashing around. But the two people sitting still sitting at the table and not even the teacups on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caravan has already turned over. The merchants and the mercenaries climbed up and hurriedly turned and ran and cursed the two unlucky ones picked up on the road. I can't think of anyone who was chased by a great magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people who jumped out of the caravan did not run the turbulent airflow and blew the tattered cloaks of the two men to reveal their true colors. A young human man is a beautiful elf girl. The elf girl held a green leaf in her hand and the green light from the leaves slowly infiltrated her and wrapped her around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original world tree leaf has such a great effect on the elf hand. The natural magic used by it has such a high level. No wonder Master Eden You can't pick them up anymore." The middle-aged man looked at the wood chips in the area and nodded and looked at the man who fired the ball. His voice is also eccentric and has the same feeling of being in the throat like Master Eden. "Is that kid? It turned out to be an idiot that wouldn't use magic. It's a pity that the effect of daylight baptism and the leaves of the world tree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 days ago Master Aiden finally found out that Asa, who was quietly heading to Oufu, said that he was ready to kill himself. Without the magical increase of the Sunwell, Asa and his combat power are completely different from the air magic of Aiden Master. But even the two people never imagined that the Elf girl Luya, who was on the side, used the leaves of the world tree to use a lot of incredible natural magic. Master Aiden’s defense was not able to break the two, but he was also bitten by a poisonous spider after a magical change. Asa took the opportunity to repel his tactics with two defeats and he took Luya into the forest. Master Eden, who is very poisonous, did not dare to catch up and had to temporarily retreat while calling for the search for their companion Aisley in the other direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal has now found that Master Eden has slowly stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a minute." Asa suddenly shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Aiden did not wait. There is already a sparkle on the hand. He is not coming to talk to kill. The two big 6 top magicians teamed up, even if the other side has a fetish in hand, there is absolutely no room for struggle, let alone talk about what conditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will tear this up without stopping." Asa slammed the leaves of the world tree from Luya. "I heard that this thing is shredded, but it is useless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movement of Master Aden suddenly stopped. The eyes behind the mask burst into the same brilliance as his lightning, but the tone was still as flat as ever. "If you dare to tear this thing away, I definitely have a way to make you regret it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, I seem to die and have something to regret." The blue ribs on the hand of Sa are exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like to gamble?" Asa’s eyes were as flat as the eyes behind the silver mask. "Do you gamble me if I will tear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long time Aiden master said faintly: "What do you want me to wait for?" His strange voice sounds like pumping Hey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa hears that these two Necromancer's mouths have things like magical props that change their voices. Each of these members of the Necromancer Association is a well-known person in human society. Not only is the mask necessary, but the voice must also change. He asked me with all sorts of embarrassment: "I just have a few questions to ask. We have to discuss everything after we have finished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ask."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't you invite me to join your Necromancer Association?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original Ved Nina has told you "Eden master sneered a bit. "But it's not that we are just Ms. Vidnina's own wish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed with relief. Although he had already thought of this after the whispering of the whisper and the necromancer, but until now he dared to be sure. Fortunately, I did not use the transfer reel to cast the net before. At the same time, there are some losses in my heart. I don’t think that the retreat in fantasy is only a fantasy. He paused and asked again: "How can you know that we will go here and still waiting for us here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you dare to take the world tree? Is the leaf running around? Since it is not going back to the School of Magic to find Ronis, then it is only going to the west of the Tulalian Forest. And here is the nearest road to the west. We have been waiting here. The leaves of the world tree As long as this kind of god is close to ten miles, I will feel it, so I will drink tea here and you will be sent to the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to kill me Does Vedenna know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know if it matters. This is a joint decision of all members except her."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa took a deep breath. The expression is a bit twitching. He still looked at the eyes under the silver mask of Aiden’s master and asked: "You want to take this thing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not talk nonsense. He should It’s delaying time.” Another Necromancer who hasn’t spoken has slowly stood up. "His breathing is not normal. It doesn't matter if he is flustered. But our strength gap is obvious. So the only explanation is that he seems to be waiting for reinforcements."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aids?" Master Aiden heard a joke and even the mask moved because of the smile below. He looked up and looked at the town with a bird's eye view as if it were just a pile of ants under his feet. "Respected Aisley friends. What aids can there be here? Do the dwarves send troops? What kind of army or magician can deal with our two Necromancers?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Asri did not answer but looked at Asa and said, "You have to tear it and tear it. The broken leaves of the world tree will turn into the source of vitality and return to the sun well. We will wait for more. It’s the same for a few years.” With the words, the magical fluctuations in his body are getting more and more fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s face sank. He returned the leaves of the world tree to Luya and then faced the two men. The vindictive light began to shine on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes under the mask of Master Eden regained the power of the electric light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aisri put his finger into his hand and bite a drop of blood from the squeaky fingers. On the ground of the blue slate, he automatically draws a magical array and then he sings a curse: "The flame of destruction hidden in the abyss of hell"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa suddenly He got up and rushed toward the two Necromancers, and the light of the vindictiveness pulled out a subtle light and shadow behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luya's hands on the leaves of the world tree, a burst of green light instantly covered her whole body. Numerous tiny branches and leaves began to emerge on the ground at the feet of the two Necromancers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ring-shaped electro-optic spread out from the body of Aiden's body. Those tiny branches and leaves have not been able to grow up and are shattered by electro-optical light. But he did not care that these eyes have been locked in the rushing Asa. But at the same time, he suddenly heard the sound of a very clear voice coming from the side of his eyes and swayed to the figure of his companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
