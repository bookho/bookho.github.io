			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior in the hands of the Knights of the Temple has been bent, and the tiger’s mouth has also ooze blood. He resisted the arrow, but the huge impact put him in the heart. The shocking and chaotic vindictiveness and momentum of the battle collapsed, and people were knocked back and flew back. Fortunately, this pure force did not cause much harm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the other two Knights of the Templar have already reached the front of the red-haired woman, although the momentum has been weakened by the confusion, but this is after all Two strikes by the Knights of the Temple, two top human warriors, the lethality of these two swords is not much weaker than the Tauren's giant axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red-haired woman is coughing, although her yellow eyes are already full of anger and killing, but the look of this screaming is even more wilting. But she was so sullen that she reached out to two Knights of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the sword is short, and the arm of the Knights is definitely longer than the woman’s fist, this is still more than one meter for the two. Long magic sword. The two knights did not shake the slightest and still kept the original sting to the woman. Before the red-haired woman’s fist hit them, the two swords were enough to pierce her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they immediately saw the woman’s fists constantly zooming in front of them. Then two sounds were heard, and the enlarged fist hit their chest. The Glorious Battlegear fell into two big pits, and the two Knights of the Temple were simultaneously shot and flew out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bigger the fist is not the visual effect of the Knights before they were hit, and this fist really grows bigger, not just bigger. It is still getting longer. This will hit the two Knights of the Temple before the sword. The red-haired women's hands have become thick and long at the same time, and the black tight-fitting leather armor has become a black scale covering all the skin. Only these two arms hit the two shrine knights and left two often scars, black scales turned up, revealing bloody flesh and blood. At the moment of being hit, the Knights of the Temple changed the sword to the cross. Although the black scales and the meat on the arm were extremely tough, the magical swords filled with vindictiveness could be cut even with steel. /?u=109443<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not just the arm, the red-haired woman is gone. There is only one huge black body that is rapidly expanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black scales such as Wannian black iron emit a dark and bright color covering the huge, slender body. Behind it is a pair of huge shredded wings, sly, but more of a majestic crocodile-like head, a pair of yellow giant eyes exudes the momentum of overlooking all things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mollier." The next few Tauren priests issued the same bark. Although they have already guessed this strange red hair<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the true face of a woman, but when I saw the true face of this huge body, it was from the heart of the earthquake. Still can't help but scream out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the patron saint of the black elves, the most powerful creature of Nigan, the master behind it, Black Dragon Moriel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many such powerful creatures in the ancient times, but nowadays, the only dragon that can exist on the entire continent is her only one. She may be the most powerful creature on the continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now this most powerful creature can have despised all other life’s eyes but has a horrible color, not just because of her two Injury on the front paw. Also because she saw a sword, a huge sword that was gathered purely by white light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Shrine that had just been shot have not yet landed, and a huge lightsaber like a cross has been stabbed to recover from the human form. Jackie Chan’s body. The center of the huge non-sword is the figure of the Paladin Lancelot. This huge sword is a blow to all his vindictiveness and strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of Willske’s arrows is just a prelude, and then the three strikers of the Temple Knights are just a cut, Lancelot’s full blow The Holy Cross is the true climax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cooperation between the Knights of the Temple has long since no need for words and arrangements, when the red-haired woman who saw Morrison’s incarnation flew back. They know how to attack in order to achieve the best and most deadly effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Tauren priests closed their eyes. Covered my ears. The white light on the Sword of the Cross was dazzling, and the sound made them mistakenly thought that the cave had been poked by this huge lightsaber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge body of black has not been alleviated from the sudden changes, and the two resistance attacks between her have reached her limit, whether it is Dodge or resist, she has no strength to move and dodge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange dragonfly emanates from the dragon's mouth, but it is just a sound, but it seems to be a superposition of countless tiny syllables. As the sound lingered, an ice wall, a wall of earth, and a wall of fire, and a barrier surrounded by electric light, instantly appeared in midair, blocking the galloping cross of the Holy Light. At the same time, a few strong lightning, ice thorns also greeted the Paladin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four elements of the water and fire are actually just a scorn, they can be sent out at the same time, although this is not much advanced magic, but no matter the mainland A magician sees this scene, enough to let it stay for a long time, then go back and start studying the basic theory of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this can make any masterpiece of the magician's shame not play a role at this time, whether it is lightning or ice slash hitting the periphery of the lightsaber Completely dissipated, the four different layers of superimposed barriers, like thin glass, shattered in front of the splendid sharps of lightsaber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slamming sound, the red blood bursts like a mountain torrent under the white light, and then a stern dragon is almost used to wear the entire Nigan underground. world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis is still holding her Ai Mei in her arms, and the fluorescent light is shining on her face. Her expression is suddenly angry and fascinated. Her long hair has been sloppy and messy, and her clothes are just draped over her body, and there is no point in her usual coolness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Meimei curled up in Talis’s arms like a kitten, biting his lips, and his big eyes flickered and blurred. Weird look. She is very smart and can see what happened just now. Although she is hard to believe, she is very reluctant to believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not long before Asa’s departure, the vibrations on the ground and the fluctuations of the underlying elements have stopped, except for the strange warmth on the ground. Everything here has been restored to the original calm, and the sound of the river has become the only sound. The two are holding each other in motion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly a loud scream came from the depths of the earth. Although it was so fierce, it could not hide the majesty but directly awakened two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened? What is this sound?" Ai Meimei was a little scared. This sound has a strange shock, shaking her sensitive nerves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis was also awakened from the shackles. She looked at the direction of the sound, and took a moment to look at Ai Mei in her arms and said: "Let's get out of here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Asa’s big brother..." Ayimei also looked in the direction of the sound, that It is the direction in which Asa left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis’s face passed a weird look and said: "Don’t care about him, now it’s weird everywhere, maybe it’s dangerous, I have to Take you away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai Yimei hesitated for a moment, didn't seem to know what to say, was good, suddenly her eyes fell on the ground of Sun Yuan , shocked: "Hey, sister, what do you think is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be the reason for the strange vibration and elemental fluctuations, where the ground is trapped Going down a big piece, and the center still reveals a small crack, it seems that there is a fire coming out from below. The two walked to the crack, and they could still hear the sound of the covenant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original is not a solid rock formation, but a larger cave space behind a strange rock wall, and from the sound of the outgoing This seems to be much more lively than here. It’s just that the two of them are next to the river and they don’t care, they didn’t notice it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stop him, stop him." When the Tema High Priest saw the Shrine Knight and the scroll in his hand, he completely lost his usual calm. Big up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
