			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The occupation and cleansing of the desert tribes have not taken care of Talis and she does not want to worry about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is in the past, no matter how hurt or tired, she must ensure that everything is done according to her wishes. In the previous occupation of a pagan village, several swordsmen intended to marry the women in the village. She fired the swordsmen on the spot. But it didn't take long for the people in the village to die and not want to give up their original beliefs. Instead, they thought that the troops of these churches were evil devils and then she put the whole village into a torch. At that time, I felt that the sense of justice that was so noble and sublime was not tolerated and offended. It seems that I can feel a little childish and ridiculous now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the tribe’s women and children will also resist some unnecessary massacres. Perhaps the officer responsible for the occupation will have some extraordinary behavior, although she still cannot agree with these behaviors. But it is not so serious. It is just a statement to the templar who is responsible for the occupation: "Don't be too kind to treat children."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not numb But there is no energy and strength to be serious. The things that are on her body and in her heart have been so heavy that she does not want to manage these things anymore. But this is not the only reason. Not only is there no energy and strength in her heart, but she is also not hurt physically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talis Knight because your battle against the desert tribe is much better than expected... but you don’t need to make yourself So, "The priest who helped her to bandage and heal is a half-old woman who has spent most of her life in the army. It seems that there is a kind and friendly kindness that is old doctors." Looking at the wound on her body while bandaging and sighing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a well-balanced bodybuilding that does not flow through the lines that are more fluid and more fluid. This is a very beautiful body. Even the same female goddess can feel the body of the Knights of the Shrine is really good. So now it seems that the body that is more eye-catching and white as jade is now full of horrible traces of bruising. The flesh of the rolled up and these are all the damage caused by the shining armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she is not wearing the most powerful defensive armor, it is fatal. But even then her fighting method is no different from desperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you hide a little slower, your neck will conclude that if the rib is broken, then the left bone will break in the direction of the bone. Deep into the inside will be inserted into the aorta next to the heart, even if the white magic on the brilliance armor will make you not die on the spot. But you will definitely lose the fighting power, but in the army of thousands of horses... the merits are important but Don't be so desperate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis did not speak. These words were not the first time someone said to her in these days. From Celeste to this front line, every time she fights, she always rushes to the front and always has the greatest strength and always suffers the most serious injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the most courageous and vulgar warrior in the army had to admire the bravery of this female shrine knight. No one dares to take the slightest contempt for her female identity. Her performance on the battlefield is not like a woman or even a person. Every time I saw her faceless and bloody, and the head of the enemy's collar came back with a scar, the swordsman of every self-defense warrior would feel the cold of the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one knows that her desperate purpose is not to make meritorious deeds or anything else she is desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she was interspersed with numerous lives in the sword, she did not feel horror at all. She also deliberately pursues the most adventurous and therefore the most efficient method of combat. Many times there is a vague idea of ​​ups and downs in her mind: maybe it’s just like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to your hand? Talis Knight? It looks like it was cut off by a sharp weapon and it just broke. It’s your worth. You can ask a few cardinals to join forces..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have tried not to pick up." Talis answered faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand that Asa resisted and broke off was the priest who was proficient in white magic and several cardinals in the place where the Glorious Castle was interrupted. Although it is not possible to connect with a hand that has just been broken, it is not difficult to connect with the exquisite body magic of the Deva. But the white magic that is unexpected to everyone, no matter how hard you try. Even if he can heal other wounds on her body, the hand that is cut off by this sword is completely powerless. The broken wrist seems to have its own consciousness that rejects another part of the flesh and blood that has been connected to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help a person block it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reason why you can't get it because of it is not because your hand is broken...but your heart "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis has been calm and fluctuating like a statue-like face. Looked at the goddess officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess officer just shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden voice coming out of the camp: "There is a person who claims to be your sister to seek out outside the military camp. It seems that a teenage girl is a teenage girl. Still a magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Talis stood up fiercely. The two wounds that had been bandaged and treated immediately leached from the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bring her...you...avoid it..." After half a mile, Talis’s voice came out of the camp. It’s obvious that the voice is Shaking this made the soldiers outside the camp a bit strange. He didn't know how the voice of the Cavaliers who cut the enemy's head like a chicken head would have such a voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come you came here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Mei's thin body is a The broad and dirty adventurer's robes are full of tender and beautiful faces that are not commensurate with her age. In the camp, only two of them, Talis, tried to calm themselves but could not do it. She can feel her voice and eyes are different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am coming to your sister." Ai Mei's eyes are still so clear and straight to Talis. The sound is also very calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you not have arranged for you to return to Erasia? You can rest assured that the teacher has promised me..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know. I know that my sister’s pleading Lancelot has let me go. It’s really not a good thing for me to know that too many people are alive. Reasonable thing. But Lord Lanster did this. I think it must be because of my sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you should stay in Elazia Waiting for this time, you will go to the Tower of Tooth... What are you doing here for me? It’s so dangerous...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This desert is far from Elazia In this wartime, there are not many places along the way that are dangerous wild beasts and wild places where big ears are infested. And Ayimei’s a girl can come here to see the hardships and her amazing perseverance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I came to ask my sister about you. I haven't seen you since that day. I went to Celeste to find you, but you didn't ask. I know that you have come to this place, so I have been chasing it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...there are some things you don't have to know..." Talis was a little lost, she even No longer dare to look directly at Ai Mei's eyes. She left Celeste to go here. There are quite a few reasons because she didn't want to go to see Ayi Mei but she knew she would come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I must know." Ai Mei's voice is very weak and very determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to say any more. I will send you back to Erasia tomorrow." Talise interrupted Ai Meimei’s words a bit. stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, even if you don't say I know some of you are going to kill Asa, right?" Ai Mei still kept the soft voice. ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis immediately replied loudly, "He should have killed it! He is the biggest 6 most wanted and the most noble cardinal is dead." In his hands he also helped the orcs...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also...he is simply a mean and evil guy, why shouldn’t he kill?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he really damn the sister, why should you help him with a sword? Also ask Lancelot to stop embarrassing him?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's because I was crazy at the time. Don't ask about it anymore?" Talis almost screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
