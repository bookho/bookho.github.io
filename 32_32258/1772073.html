			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day at noon all the thieves came to the central square. Some of the thieves looked around and watched the battle. Some of them held weapons and looked like they were desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were not so nervous, but this morning there was news that the army of the empire had already deployed in Bracada and might soon be fighting here. This news made the thieves very confused. Originally, they wanted to leave as soon as they got the stolen goods, but now they can't advance or retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several piles of mountain-like goods in front of the square. Three middle-aged people stand in the middle of the goods. One of them is there is a few cannibals next to the hanging yesterday. magic. The middle-aged people dressed by these three officials are holding paper and pencil to record the detailed zeros of the goods they want to see from their occasional glimpses. Then the familiarity of the flying pens knows that it must be accumulated for many years. The next effort. The goods next to them are some valuable things. Some of them are spices. Some of them are satin. Some thieves with bright eyes and crafts can see that this is the long-awaited stolen goods. Someone was excited to whisper and whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A middle-aged man saw the thieves coming over and said: "All of you have arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one dares to say anything. This is a very polite wording, but for the thieves who are now allergic to the thief, it is too polite and looks like a dangerous atmosphere with cats teasing mice. The oldest and most savage Buddha Duo Duo also said nothing in it because the contradictions of yesterday, the thieves did not trust him. Now he naturally does not have to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All are coming together." Seeing no one speaking out of Asa, he replied. He doesn't really want to go out, but he doesn't want to be snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man nodded and said, "Who are all from here should be from the Ian Fast Empire?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one dares to say this time. The empire has taken extermination of the orcs for more than a decade. As early as the time they came here, the old thieves and Buddhas are so eager to ask everyone to say that they are empire, so as not to incite the anger of the orcs and pull them directly. Rotten and swallowed. Now the empire's army is even more stunned by them. They are now more likely to be considered as spies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, yes. We are all." Asa simply said that all the thieves were almost jumped up by his answer. He also poked him. However, he felt that if someone asked this question more and more, he did know that there is no need to continue to conceal. He always likes to deal with things directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, several ogres there did not rush to kill them because they heard their identity. The middle-aged people also continued to say: "We are probably clear about the reasons for your coming here. Someone here reports to us that you want to buy the stolen goods that the big-eared monsters robbed, that is, you want to resell them. The black market businessman of the booty and the person who died yesterday is also your companion. Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Asa is now the thief gang. The words. Others are already nervous. The ogres standing there are hung a huge axe in the waist. The huge size of the huge size can kill people even if they are not dead. Many people have been imagining their own miserable deaths under such horrible weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I will regret to tell you that you can’t do what you want. The big ear robbing these goods we didn’t know beforehand but they’re going to join We must comply with our laws in our cities. We are not hostile to any country and are welcome to all legitimate businessmen. So we will return all the goods to the robbed caravan and naturally cannot handle it. As for your chaotic friends, we are also very sorry that no matter who he is, as long as they violate the laws of our city-state, we only act in accordance with our laws. I hope that everyone can also remember to violate in our city. The punishment of the law is very strict, so be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Law'. The word thieves were originally scorned but now they feel abnormal weight. Most of the thieves have vowed in their hearts that if they can survive this difficult time, they must become the most law-abiding person in the city. Even the engravings on the stone tablets will be recited from time to time to avoid inadvertent offense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the words of middle-aged people suddenly turned to an unexpected aspect. "No matter what you want to do, since we have not violated our laws, that is our guests. In order not to let your first guests of Einfast disappoint, we decided to withdraw a small portion from these goods. To everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man continued: "The goods that are being counted here are the gifts that we are going to return to those merchants. They have already been placed in the city hall. Please select a few people to check them and then you can take them away. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is asking alone: ​​"But is the empire not sending troops to prepare for the war? How can we go back even if we take the goods?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man smiled and said very gently: "We have no hostility to all countries and are not prepared to fight any enemy. Your country The initiative is only a one-time allergy, and we will soon send messengers to contact with your country. I believe that our return of goods from your country is enough to express our sincerity in the hope of peace. I also believe that your country will not like to incite the spirits. We are very confident that in a very short period of time, we will completely reconcile this with your country. This is a small gift that will be sent to you. It is also a wish for us to talk to your friends. I hope that you can go back to your friends after you return. Up to the situation we have here to tell you about "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; thieves this slowly adapted to the surprise sensation immediately excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Awesome means." The thief’s hustle and bustle, who had been saying nothing for a while, said gently in Asa’s ear that Asa felt the ear itchy. . "In the case of intimidation, grace. These thieves who have benefited will return to the order here and the friendliness of human beings. This kind of rumbling from their mouth is somewhat easier than the official announcement. Convincing. And if they return the goods to the merchants of the empire, even if they are a little less, they will be recovered for those businessmen. It’s also an unexpected good news. They will also be wary of the orc’s city-state and the empire is here. The hostility will also drop greatly. So even if people know that there are a large number of orcs here, they will be convinced that it is orderly and friendly. There must be countless businessmen coming here for a long time. The benefits it derives are comparable to the value of these goods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nod. However, he only cares about the book that is mixed in the goods. If this is the case, then everything will be solved. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the discussion, it was natural that the singer who had been on the verge of fear and arrogance had taken the place to be the representative. He led several people to the city government office to check the goods. This is also the need for Asa to look forward to see if the book will be mixed in this small part of the goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They followed a middle-aged man to the City Hall. The City Hall is undoubtedly the most magnificent building in the city. Although it is still made of boulder, the scale is even more than ten times that of a large ordinary building here. It is more like a castle with a shorter floor and no floor. The central hall is enough for people to ride in the huge stone pillars that are galloping inside. It is necessary for several talents to hold together and use other places to separate a lot of rooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s obvious that many Orcs and humans are busy entering and leaving the paper in their mouths and talking to each other. They are completely blind to these alien human beings. The busy scene of the market exchange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goods are in the corner of the hall. An old man and a young man are beside this pile of goods. The middle-aged introduced the old man is the owner of the city of Cedros in the city of Oufu. It was he who decided to give the goods to the thieves. The young man next to him is General Gru who leads all the Oufu troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s waist and back are straight and thick. The thick silver head and beard must be very nice if you can save it, but it’s just like you’re not in the way. The ground trimming is short. This free-spirited silver must shine in the sunlight coming in the window, and even the wrinkles on his face seem to be extravagant as if it were just a kind of ornament that expresses age and experience. The eyes in the wrinkles are clearly black and white, which are unique to young people. This is an old man who has no taste of ‘old’ at all. He is dressed in the ordinary, and if he is mixed in the crowd, it is very inconspicuous. It is difficult to be associated with the status of the ‘owner’ and the power of the city. It is still such a strange city filled with orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Gru is about thirty years old and his appearance seems to be not commensurate with his position. His face is a bit pale and pale. The outline is so sharp that there is a pair of dark scorpions under the sturdy long eyelashes of the sculpture. Even the light seems to be difficult to reflect the elegance of a few elves. When Asa first saw him, he suddenly gave birth to an inexplicable familiar feeling, but when he thought about it, he did not have any impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa inadvertently looked at him more and more, but the more he noticed, the more he was attracted. The skeletal muscles that are exposed outside the clothes are so perfect that the skin's luster is so perfect that even the sculptors who are more sophisticated can't express the combination of streamlines and texture. It is hard to believe that it is actually a thing that is actually composed of flesh and blood. It seems that only the essence can be squeezed into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Gru suddenly turned his head and the dark scorpion greeted Asa’s sight as if it had flashed. Asa subconsciously twisted his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many goods left for them, but they are probably quite a percentage of all goods. Take a little and make up. Although it is insignificant compared to the total number of these goods, it is probably worth hundreds of gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several thieves stepped forward to pick up the goods. These things are sold out and evenly divided. Everyone can also divide ten gold coins. The expected wealth makes the thieves fall into great excitement. The high-cap is constantly flying out of the mouth of the eloquent mouth. The system is so strict that the standard of living is high, and it is said that the one-eyed dragon is not guilty of death. It is completely smothered for the people. The food specially prepared for them is simply a rare dish of human beings. All this is naturally attributed to the urban master. The wise management. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you feel that this is not bad, I hope that when you go back, you will tell us the truth about our situation here." Cedros City owner smiled Watching the thieves pounce on the goods like a kind owner looking at a group of cats and dogs showing excitement for a pile of bones. "You can't use the news about the war. I can almost certainly be unable to fight this war." The relaxed tone seems to be really confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, you are the most talented leader I have ever met." "If there is a chance, I will definitely come to live in your city." The grateful feelings of the thieves are beyond words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you have such a thing?" A thief suddenly cleared a package from the inside of the goods and opened it to see the powder and baubles that were all makeup. There is also a book for the girl’s personal belongings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a very old book from the color point of view, but it’s not so old. It’s made of leather and it’s made of several large characters on the cover. Weird is not a universal text. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That should be the merchant's personal belongings, the big ear screams were also sent together after the robbery. We have to send it back to the merchant's hand. The middle-aged man came over and picked up the book and the parcel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa turned and did not let people see him a little excited. Although he is already trying to calm down, the ultimate goal of this whole journey is to make him even more sturdy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is almost now possible to confirm that this book is in place. Just wait until they return the goods to find the caravan where Cliss is showing the appointment document of the bishop. It is easy to get the hand and go back to return to Sandro to report to Bishop Ronis and then complete the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has always hated what 'not to do' things, free to do whatever he wants, is his favorite lifestyle, when Bishop Ronis gave this task to him. Although he felt unshielable, he was not very comfortable. The intricate task of this ups and downs of the waves was unsuccessfully completed. It seems that the bag that has been tied to the back of the hand has suddenly disappeared and a relaxed feeling of ease has made him happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute." The city of Cedros took a beckoning gesture to the middle-aged people to feel the pleasant feeling of Asa. "Show me the book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Cedros took the book in his hand and only looked at the cover and the front pages began to change. There is no doubt that he can understand what it is. Of course, the face became even more powerful, but the next Asa was no one noticed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How could it be such a thing?" The city owner shook his head in surprise and handed the book to the next General Gru. "It’s very dangerous to put this kind of thing around you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I took it back under the pillow." The young general was indifferent It is like the safest and safest place in the world. His voice is very good and very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, that's good." The city owner nodded and clearly recognized the insurance level of the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Gru reached out and took the book. His hands are very neat, his fingers are very long and the shape of his hands is very elegant and his well-defined face is combined with a graceful and graceful image. Asa has a faint scar in his hand from the mouth of the tiger to the palm of his hand. It seems that a straight palm print runs diagonally through the palm of your hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
