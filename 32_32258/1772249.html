			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the Pope know the existence of Mr. Sandru? If so, the meaning of his return to Clauses is very different." Head of Roland Asked frowning. His face has been quite bad these days. In fact, no matter who is the disciple before his own, the Necromancer returned to make waves and even the later disciples became accomplices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Should... know it." Cedros nodded slightly and his intriguing eyes flashed with some intriguing light. "Although I don't know how much he knows... but knows that it must be less than we know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So that means he deliberately let Claves Come back to die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not necessarily. He can see that Javy is the person of Deya Valley, that is, he must know that he must have something behind him. Support Perhaps what he meant is that the Marquis, who deliberately wanted to make Mr. Deva and Mr. Sandru appear later, isn’t that the case?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland asked: But what is the relationship between Sandru and Deva Valley? I think it seems that the Necromancers are very scrupulous about him because the actions of the Marquis of Hamm seem to be different from the meaning of other Necromancers..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a pity that Mr. Sandro was not invited to come here. If he is there, many things will be clearer and we won’t be guessing here.” . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa always feels a little uncomfortable. He knows that faceless expression is actually a very intriguing expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros shook his head and said, "The principles of the Necromancers who truly appreciate the spirit of Archibald are not something you can imagine. Don't try to use You or anyone's values ​​are to evaluate them. They are truly out of this secular person, even if people have to live in seclusion here, but they will always be next to the dark heart of Deya Valley." People continued to say. "In fact, we don't have to scrutinize this in detail. From the general guess, we can know that the Pope actually just throws the hot potato of Jawi to the king's capital. He does not want those who are obsessed with the power of the Necromancer in Seles. The special forces are so bullish that the kid who was originally ambitious has intensified all the contradictions here and he is watching the show in the glorious castle thousands of miles away. Whether it is Deya Valley or we have some damage, I believe that he is very happy. I saw it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small 懿 ask: "I don’t care if the empire finally leads to a complete break with the church?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Einfaest was not under the jurisdiction of the church. He simply couldn't get any benefit at all. I think he is so eager to let go of it so much that it makes it really like to be Jarvis. This failure is also beneficial to him. At least approaching the empire to make the camp clear that he is good to deal with."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Together? Celeste has such a big Ability? In the war of Oufu just Failure Elasia and several other countries are all badly hurt. You said that he actually wants to deal with Oufu and Einfas?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros I smiled at Xiaoxiao and said, "Don't look at Magnus. The guy usually doesn't seem to have any conspicuous movements. I can guarantee that he can keep things very deep."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s head faintly said: "I have already sent Jarvi back to Celeste. Together with the Institute of Magic, I intend to leave the Celeste jurisdiction. The letter will look at what the unfathomable Magnus will react to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celester. Glorious castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Jia Wei, who was sent to Ernst, finally came back a few days ago, but the bishop who was still alive and dying was being carried back. . Bishop Jia Wei was unclear and the muscles and nerves of the whole body were broken by the unknown power. He was able to continue to live and there was a little strange breath that stubbornly stayed in the body of Jia Wei’s bishop. The white magic used by the Cardinal could not restore his injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger of Ian Fast just said that this is the inexplicable injury of Bishop Javey and then left a letter that is said to be Ernest The emperor gave the letter to the Pope. Turn around and ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor’s letter of words is simple and clear. That is to say, the School of Magic has a close relationship with the Empire. After the empire, the management of Celeste will not have to worry about it from now on. Everything is already clear. Bishop Javey’s result in the election of the Einfast Empire is not very good. It can even be said to be awful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
