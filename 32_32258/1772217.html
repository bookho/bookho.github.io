			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Adela came to the Pope Hall with the Jarvis Warrior, several of the red-collars who remained in Celeste were also summoned to stand On the two sides of the hall, Lanlot quietly stood behind the pope as a statue of the same guardian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Templars Javier sees His Majesty the Pope." Jia Wei Samurai squatting Adela returned to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the Pope’s snowy white eyebrows have slightly eccentricity of the elderly. He looks at the templar underneath. He said slowly: “Javi Warrior's tactical advice submitted by you. The key to analyzing the precise insights is that it is really hard to be able to show such a vision and judgment in your young people. The situation is really confusing, so I want to hear your opinion. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The praise of the old man who is almost no different from God in the eyes of ordinary people in the top of the power of the big 6 is for any young person. It should be a kind of dream of a great glory. However, Javier’s face did not show signs of getting out of control because of excitement, but said with a expression and tone that expressed gratitude and reverence: “Thank you for your compliment.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope continues to say: "A priest in the highland coalition has just come to report to me that Oufu has used a forbidden mantra in the first contact war. The morale has plummeted. It is said that there may be another forbidden axis in the hands of Oufu, 'Meteor Fire and Rain'. Erasi also sent a message a few days ago that Tatiya’s offensive has almost reached the king. Now the coalition I am already at a disadvantage. What do you think should be done?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javier samurai ran and replied: "Reporting to your Majesty is a sacred warrior's duty. There is a lot of things to be able to do. There is nothing in the church and the knights who are responsible for the military research. I don’t think anything about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope A smile said: "Stand up. Since I asked you. Just answer honestly. What do you think about the current situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The Templar stood up and seemed to think before thinking: " Although Oufu and Tataglia seem to have a full advantage now, they are just a short-lived one. There is no fundamental change in the overall situation. Please rest assured that their defeat is only a matter of time."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? How do you say? Now the coalition and Erasia are being beaten up by them." Although the Pope was asking, there was no curious look on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The current advantage is that Oufu uses the brilliant strategy and tactics to get the ultimate effect. But the war competition is the power of the state. However, the establishment of the foundation is weak, no matter the population of the orc population or the productivity, and other aspects are completely incomparable with the big countries such as Elazia. Although there are many materials obtained through commercial acquisition in a short period of time, it is impossible to maintain a long war. Tatalia, but the alliance of some barbarian tribes, although the new king Taize may be the most promising king in history, but the national strength is not too bad, even worse than Oufu, so they can give Alicia a big surprise. But overall, it is not enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope nodded. It seems that this fine-grained analysis is very appreciative and continues: "What do you mean that this time we will win the coalition? No regrets, I have ordered the coalition to temporarily retreat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not leave the holy Ming. Today, the coalition forces left in the wild land are less than half and the morale of the soldiers has been low. Even the commanders are frightened by the curse of the curse. There is no victory. And Elazia This time, under the harassment of the barbarians, I am afraid that I will no longer be able to send troops to the wild in a short period of time. The coalition forces are now reluctant to attack. It is useless to continue to stay in the highlands. It is useless to temporarily save the strength. It is a good policy to temporarily retreat and retain the strength for the next attack. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding cardinals also slightly nodded. This precise analysis does analyze the current situation in a big way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave the next attack? Since you all know that Erasia can't send troops to the army in the short term, you are so sure that I will definitely call the coalition again to attack Europe. Bless?" The Pope sighed. "It’s just that there have been 10,000 soldiers killed and wounded. Each of them is a believer of the Lord who raised the sword in his hand for the Lord’s glory. But now he is buried in the wild land. The Knights of the Temple have lost two There is even a Master of Light. Although you said that Oufu will eventually die, but how many believers will bury the bones in the wild? Do you think I still need to send troops?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Is it so serious?" The Pope's eyebrows picked it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just that in a short period of time, the orcs can build a city of this size on the otherwise ridiculous highlands. If they show it for more than a decade, let those beasts It’s not hard to imagine what the population of the people has been greatly improved. The orcs can’t be converted to the glory of the Lord, so it’s very likely that they will no longer be in the wild and expand to the outside. Maybe Ella Countries such as West Asia are powerless to stop them. In the end, perhaps even the glory of the Lord will be lost in the shadow of those beasts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." The Pope frowned and nodded. . "Then, what do you think should be the most effective and most effective in reducing the casualties of Oufu?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, Oufu Thousands of orcs and the unfavorable conditions in the middle of the wild land are not enough to compete with the army. This time they can achieve victory is the limit that can be achieved by their ability. As long as there is another army pressure this time The lessons and experience of Oufu absolutely means the day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." The Pope looked at the Jawi Warrior and nodded again. "But now Erasia is afraid that he will never be able to send troops any more in the short term. How can the Juda bus be able to gather so many troops without the whole army?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Not far from the side of the Javier, Adela's bishop's expression began to slightly become unnatural. His vision turned from the pope's face to the Templar. With a little worried look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javier Samurai can’t see the expression of Adela’s bishop just continue to say: “Have you forgotten? Oufu’s east also has love. The empire of the Faust. The territory and military power of the Einfas empire are the most important. If they are out, they will not only face the overwhelming force but also the enemy. Even the subtle tactics and strategies Lu’s personal combat strength is no longer a residual candle in the wind.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope closed his eyes and shook his head and sighed. "Actually, this is also the reason why I called you Jiawei Samurai. You are said to be in my consideration. The Magic Academy thinks that you know how much you have always made me have a headache so I want to hear from you. The view on this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Einfast Empire is not so much affected by the Celeste Specials or even the subordinates of the Magic Academy to the Glorious Castle. The relationship is also vague and the nominal relationship is more than the actual relationship. This is somewhat an anecdote of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty years ago, when Pope Gregory V died, the biggest successor was not the Pope Magnus, who is sitting here now, but alone He calmed the six prestigious wars of Dongda University and was recognized as the most prestigious and strongest of the bright magician who was in charge of the Magic Academy. But in the end, Magnus was on the rise of the Pope. Bishop Ronis still stayed at the School of Magic. As for the reason, no one knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dongda 6 is not close to the West in the wilderness of the wilderness and the south of the Dragon Desert. Although the Holy See was painstakingly established in the East many years ago. Subordinate institutions, but the power of the peripheral churches that have always been able to succumb to the IMF's Imperial Power Center can't be as much as the West. However, after the appointment of Bishop Ronis, the status and reputation of the Cardinal's extraordinary talents and ability magic school in Dongda 6 reached a true peak and really affected the political situation of Dongda 6. However, this is only the status of the Academy of Magic, not the status of the Holy See. Many ignorant civilians only know that there is a magic school. There is still a real center in the west. Celest only knows that Bishop Ronis does not know that there is Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Bishop Rooney’s attitude towards Celeste has always been to ignore the fact that the order of the Holy See is not turned a blind eye to the only return to the Glorious Castle. It was not to see the Pope, but to find Lancelot to borrow two Knights of the Temple. The School of Magic even has a 'Little Holy See' in Dongda 6 and only needs to see the Einfast Empire and the Magic Academy jointly own a 'Palace of the Knights'. It can clearly feel the influence of the Holy See on Dongda 6. In fact, it is really minimal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing to do with these Celestes, perhaps because of the prestige and status of Bishop Ronis. At least the Pope never said anything about his behavior. Have any dissatisfaction. Second, the Holy Land is not very likely to be forced to interfere with the Magic Academy. Even Erasia can't compete with the archetype army more than the old Einfast Empire. Anyway, Ionfas is nominally The special empire also returned to the glory of the Lord and had to close his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope continued: "I have sent people to negotiate with the Emperor of Einfast many times but I have not seen any results. What do you think Jiawei Warriors should do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Adelaide's lips behind the Javier Samurai moved and seemed to want to say something but still did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javier warrior thought about it. Answer: "If you want to kneel down, you should not focus on Geffenhardt's head. It should be the head of the Duke of Mulak and the Knights of the Paladin. Today these two men are really interested in the emperor's intention. People, but these two people are loyal to Ian Fast, all of whom are clear-minded and intelligent. They are very difficult to deal with each other."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh. It sounds like you know something about the situation of the Einfast Empire." The Pope’s somewhat surprised eyes fell on the Jarvis warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Templar replied with amazement: "I have stayed in the king of Ian Fast for a while, so I have a better understanding of it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, that's good..." The Pope smiled and nodded, but he still didn't continue to say that Javier was the first to say: "My Majesty is willing to go." Ian Faster handles this matter. For the sake of the submarine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope’s expression is full of surprises and looks at the Jarvis Samurai Body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just the Cardinals and Lancelot on both sides of Pope Adela’s bishop, looked at the difference between this young Templar with amazement It was only Lancelot that was a little surprised that the Cardinals were a little surprised and the Ala Bishop was surprised and even a little scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh. Good..." The first thing to restore normality and calm is that the Pope even said three good faces. The 6 most powerful faces are full. Appreciate the color. "This is a very difficult thing. I sent a lot of people but I didn't have any effect. Are you so sure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javier samurai said: "Talk no I am sure that it is my vocation for the Lord's glory for the lives of thousands of believers. I am obliged to live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope smiles slightly at his smile It gives a very deep and heavy feeling. It seems that he laughs not just to laugh at himself but to unify the countless backgrounds and things behind him. The pope got up and walked down to the throne and reached for the templar in front of the templar. He put his hand on his forehead and said, "Good Jiawei warrior, you can attack at the olympic battlefield in the crisis of the Millennium. The Orc ambush saved the Knights of Wales. And all the dangerous missions that Lancelot had given you before were also done very well. These all show that you have outstanding skills and the courage to sacrifice for faith. I can see the extraordinary wisdom of you and the firm belief in the Lord. Therefore, I am now instructing you to go to the School of Magic to take over the death of Bishop Ronis, so that the School of Magic will return to the Glorious Castle. His Majesty let Einfast send troops to Oufu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding Cardinals burst into a repressed exclamation. Although it was only temporarily granted, the position of the Cardinal was indeed too high for a young man who had just entered the Glorious Castle for less than a year. There were countless devout clergy who could not even touch the bishop's side for the rest of his life. The surprise color on Lancelot's face was not so heavy, just frowning slightly. The expression on the face of Adela's bishop is very weird and complicated. There are incredible joys, but more anxiety and horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most normal and calmest face is the squatting Javi Samurai. He bowed his head and replied loudly: "Thank you. Follow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the order of the Pope’s order, and so on, everything is as simple as possible. Soon, Bishop Javi will go to love Einfast. His Majesty the Pope gave this order that everyone was shocked. After he had not asked too much, he soon rested on a platform at the top of the Glorious Castle. Only Lancelot was alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the highest point of the Glorious Castle. Through the white light of the outer wall of the castle, you can take the farthest horizon to the undulating sky under the blue sky. The lines look awkward and clear, and the infinite scenery behind them strongly suggests that the eyes of all viewers are low. The Pope's eyes repeatedly sweeping his expression under this innocent line is a kind of relaxation that is not completely relaxed. It is like a person who has completed a work but has not completely completed it and rests here for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have to do this?" Lancelot, behind him, asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot frowned slightly: "I don't mean this underarm. I mean, have to pull these questions to be solved by Enfasite? After all, it is not the scope we can control... After all, our main goal now is Europe. I am afraid that the change is too big after the goal of the blessing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know. It's not that I want to pull the problem there to solve it... but actually All the problems were originally born from there... whether it is Oufu or something else..." The Pope sighed and looked up. The sky was a blue-green noon, and his opaque eyes became a seam, but he still tried to watch the group's eye-catching brilliance. He muttered to himself as if he was whispering to the sun in the air: "Ronnis unfortunately you can't see it. You don't have to worry about it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot no longer speaks just to see the pope. Every wrinkle on Magnus's face that looks up is a dark ditches and a glossy reflection on the side, such as the same monotonous black and white print. Lancelot himself sighed a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time in a room on the lower level of the Glorious Castle, the Adelaide Bishop is just like the ants on the hot pot, and his face has always been charming and kind. All became anxious. Next to it is Jia Wei who was just promoted to the Cardinal. He didn't panic like Adela's bishop, but he frowned slightly. The instruments that are about to rush to Ian Fast and the ones that have the following items are prepared by him and he is not busy with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This trouble is troublesome now." Adela quickly rushed from one end of the room to the other without a little bit of cardinal. It should have the same grace as a headless fly. I kept whispering in my mouth: "I don't think that you are so quick to notice that you are ready to deal with you so quickly. You are not prepared to deal with us. You must be busy telling others about the union. But now we can't get away. What should I do..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javier, silently speaking, suddenly said to Bishop Adela: "I can't tell my father about this for the time being." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is of course..." Adela's bishop in the pacing responded with a sigh of relief but immediately responded and asked with a loud voice: "What do you say?" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I know that this is the bedroom of Adela’s bishop, no one will come here to peep around, but Javey and himself are shocked by this voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adra lowered his voice and said to Javey: "What joke are you doing? You don't know if you are ready to send you to the school of magical school? You Don't know his true intentions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I certainly know otherwise, how can I ask for it?" Jia Wei faintly snorted. "From the time he asked me about those problems, I probably guessed the problems. Isn't he still unclear in his own heart? He just wants me to step by step in front of the bishops and then find an excuse." Send me if I don't agree with him, there is reason for me not to be reused. So I don't want to take the initiative to ask for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But other places Fortunately, the king of Einfast is your hometown. Do you really think that you can win friends and relatives who have known you for 20 years?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; &nbsp; "Friends and relatives? I don't seem to have that kind of thing." Jia Wei took some ridicule and helplessly smiled. He raised his hand and touched his face, which was distinct and unobtrusive. He said: "What's more, Shante The skill of the teacher is so brilliant that even when I see the mirror, I don’t really know which image is really me, let alone other people.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a face but something else? Rolande of the Paladin Changshan Drew... These people can not fool the past with a face, as long as they show flaws in front of them, it may even be dangerous for your father." Adela eagerly persuaded Jawi The impatience looks like a stubborn person who does not listen to advice can't immediately grab him and tie his hands and feet. "And do you think this task can be achieved? You can think about Sandru and Roland and the lady before you. Will they give the Magic Academy to your hand? Will you let Einfa? Stewart ruined the covenant and attacked Oufu, which Ronis had always supported?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you say? Can I still retreat at this point? I What will happen to the escape? Will he send you to the Magic Academy next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not leave him...will not send me..." The expression of Dr. Della’s bishop seems to be somewhat eccentric. "He just specially dealt with you. Maybe he already saw that you are a Descartes person and intends to throw you to Sandro so that we have to find a way to confront Shandru and Ai Grenair regardless of the outcome. Both sides will suffer a lot of damage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
