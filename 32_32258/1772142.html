			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunlight broke through the blockade of the distant hilltops and was thrown into the valley along with the light. Several ferns that are unique here slowly stretched out the leaves. I hope to get as much as possible of this precious sunshine. Even the mushrooms in the cracks of the rocks seem to accelerate. Two or three gray bag beasts did not know where to come out and probed around the brain. As soon as they saw the giant rock, they immediately escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if they have enough resolution, it can be seen that this is actually a corpse with a sinister body and a rather ruined body. The sharpest sword is also hard to hurt. The fur has long been a thousand holes. The muscles of the dead gray are even strong and the huge claws are cut off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa jumped over Bimen’s head and sat down on his knees to meditate meditation from start to finish. When the mind is clear and the water state reaches its best state, he slowly injects all his magic power into the body of Bimen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must be extremely careful that this scorpion is already the key to their ability to get out of here. Although these two days have been particularly careful, but because of the many magical catalysis and control, this is actually very fragile than the body structure of the body. If there is a slight mistake, it will immediately become a carrion. And because of their current state and strength, they can no longer hunted a head to make a zombie, and he himself is really not confident that he can make another one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa’s head was soaked with sweat. The magical power required to operate the corpse with a huge and strong body like Bimeng and the mental power required for control are not comparable to manipulating other bodies. If it is made into a zombie, it is naturally easier, but the time of the zombie is not long-lasting and the combat power is greatly reduced. It is even more surprising that it is a waste. So he only made this kind of zombie that is much more complicated but can be fully combated and lasting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Bimon’s body moved. Asa Chang Shu jumped out in one breath. Finally succeeded. But today is definitely the last day of tomorrow. This huge corpse may not even have bones under the erosion of Necromancer. He slowly spoke to the werewolf who had been standing next to help him protect the law: "We must go out of the valley today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well. I know." Werewolf Road Ken nodded. This is a very young, very strong and very intelligent wolf. The yellow-white fur and the similar ones are more inclined to the human more aura. From the intellectual point of view, he is even smart in humans. What makes Asa even more strange is that although he speaks with the unique and strange tone of the werewolf, he is already very fluent. This is not just a clever reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, why did Asa not ask. All the energy and intentions here are to live in the next moment. He sighed and looked up at the surrounding Xiongfeng Peak, which stood between the heavens and the earth. No matter how you look at it, you can't get a glimpse of the whole mountainside. The thick clouds above it should be a higher snowy peak. No one knows what else is above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any of these six most majestic and most dangerous peaks, no matter what life is, it seems so small and powerless. Whether it is yourself or the wolf next to it, even the Bimon, who lives here, is the same. Looking at the few Asa that supported the endless sky, this time for the first time in this life has this feeling of awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the true fear of the heavens and the earth from the fear of the soul. Those who have been here will realize how powerless and ridiculous the gods that are enshrined, even if there is a god in this world, they will only live on the summit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint screams of gold and iron in the clouds are intertwined with the ubiquitous winds. This is the main melody that can be heard everywhere in Sandefes. . Asa’s ear heard that it should be just two or three eagle owls instead of terrible thunderbirds. He looked at Luken and gestured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolfman closed his eyes and his furry pointed ears were divided on both sides to estimate the direction and angle of their flight and then nodded and said: "About one The height of the kilometer is far to the northwest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed and waved his hand, "Come out." He hoped that this was the last time I heard these giant birds. The sound is gone. Every day here, these raptors of the same horrible bird as the Wyverns can only cope with the past. The team that was looking for ore on the mountainside that day was inevitably fighting a Thunderbird that was surrounded by blue and white lightning. Although he eventually killed it and obtained more than a dozen feathers with magical powers, he paid a heavy price for a werewolf and six lizards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luken led others out of the two giant rocks and was ready to move on. But there was another bad news right away. The ogre wound called Clorin has been further aggravated. Even the tenacious vitality of the lizard can no longer support the body. The ribs with the thickness of the arm have already broken a few scars that are almost deep into the internal organs. Although they healed slightly under the healing magic, they still consume the energy and anger of the ogre. If it wasn't for that thick steel armor, it would have resisted in front of him. The body that was huge and solid compared to humans was not much worse than a pile of shattered under Bimen's claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sank a command: "Let him throw off his armor and throw it away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The ogre, who was thrown away after a total of nearly a thousand pounds of steel nails and hammers, was carried on the road by Bi Meng’s body. But for this reason they also had to abandon a small pocket of ore that might contain the eyes of the magic jade and the star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I admire your decision, although this may not be a good decision." Werewolf Luken carrying a small pocket of ore and walking low to say in Asa . A small piece of the eye of the star and the magic jade can be said to be worthless, and it is still unknown whether the ogre is saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa shook his head and said faintly: "Cedros should also hope to get out of it as much as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four ogres, six werewolves, ten lizards, and every orc who entered the depths of the Sandefes Mountains was an elite warrior in the family. Such a dozen individuals can be counted as a big force in the Oufu army. There are only two ogres, two werewolves and one lizard. It’s still less than half of the time it’s coming in and it’s all hurt and tired. But because of this, the orcs who go out from here during this period of life and death will be the warriors among the elite warriors in the elite. This is the real wealth of Oufu. What's more important is that this kind of choice in this case will strengthen a kind of mutual cohesion. It is the invisible force that Cedros has always attached great importance to. The influence of Oufu is very far-reaching. Block magic gems can be measured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another reason why Asa knows it. The injury of this ogre and the loss of other orcs are actually due to his judgment mistakes. He really wants to be able to go out alone from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werewolf Luken nodded. I do not know whether to agree or understand the true meaning behind this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another werewolf and a good ogres with a good body cast a pretty emotional look that is Alkin and Vail. The last lizard, Vieste, took a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these days, although everyone has no time and mood to communicate with each other, the experience between life and death makes each other more familiar. They didn't talk, only carrying things silently walking with expressions and the meaning expressed by the eyes could understand each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa spreads the map. This is very detailed in the drawing of the front of the valley and the beasts of every water source and in the wild. If it wasn't for Asa's decision to go too far in the valley and climb the mountainside and walk outside the map, it wouldn't hurt so many people. Of course, there will not be such a big gain. A full five-pocket ore mine is definitely the largest ever mine from Sandefis. It can almost equal the sum of the previous decades.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;San Defi There are a variety of magical materials in the mountains, whether they are used directly after processing or made into magic weapons, armor and props are the best of all. But the huge wealth here also has a corresponding huge danger. Even the mysterious underground labyrinth of Deva Valley and Nigan is faint in front of these majestic peaks. No one dares to deny that this mountain that stands in the north of the wild highlands is the most dangerous place in the Big Six. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some extremely sinister living environments where thunderstorms and snow and ice can occur at any time, and there is almost no human food and water source to eat. Both Simon and Thunderbird are the 6 most dangerous and most aggressive animals. Even the strongest warriors are vulnerable to these violent animals. The rich magical mineral deposits in the mountains make the entire area always filled with turbulent magical fluctuations. The magicians who are even worse can't even use magic here. Because of such a sinister environment, so many magical materials that can be brought out from here for so many years are actually fewer and fewer people who have died here to become wild animal food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Oufu’s actions have been exhausted. In order to beware of the death of the Necromancer Gru can not leave Oufu for a long time, so only let Asa lead this selected group of orcs with the most complete equipment and supplies from Oufu through a long journey into the depths of the mountains . Only these beasts with strong survivability in the wild can stay as long as possible in this sinister environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why he dares to be so bold is because he has confidence in his own necrotic magic. As long as you can kill a Bimeng corpse, you can more easily kill other Bimon and then make it into a corpse and then continue to grow...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not until later that Asa realized that she was too confident and too big. His self-confidence almost completely wiped out the entire team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Bimen is quite resistant to magic, it’s easy to deal with toxin magic or the vampire knife made by Sand. Much more. It is a pity that the vitality of the creature killed by the Necromancer is mutated and cannot be made into a corpse. So the team only with the help of the corpses of several gray beasts and a hard battle to kill a lizard who injured an ogre and finally killed the only beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the beast, Asa used a corpse to make the result but only made the body rotten into a mud. This time, Asa thought it was an accident caused by the unfamiliarity of this corpse. But when it failed to the third time, Asa was frightened and actually had no ability to make such a huge creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His magical power is indeed the level of abundant necromantic magic is not low. But he forgot that his abundant magic is from the aliens. The magical spirit of the gods is also because of the help of the dark meditation. What he lacks is a true caster's skill and delicate feeling of magic manipulation. Those are magical. The essence is accumulated by time and experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can make and control hundreds of crows or a few gray beasts that are taller and stronger than bears. However, when he was almost a child with a vitality in the hill, he was only childish. With his ability to control more than a magic apprentice, he can't completely control the enormous power of the body. Necromancer magic is a subtle magical mistake that leads to the failure of magic. In terms of the shape and strength of Bimeng, even Sandru’s personal shots can only control three or four bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After several failures in the production of the zombies, the combat strength and number of troops gradually weakened to the point where they could no longer fight against Bimun. The last fight with the adult Bimeng made everyone suffer from the lightest injury. The strongest ogre Clolla was also desperate for life. I don't know if it was luck or a blast in the desperate. Asa finally made the squad into a zombie. Then I relied on it to do the main force against the big eagle and other Bimeng attacks, and finally collected four pockets of ore on the mountainside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least from the results, his plan is indeed successful. But Assass is not happy. The death of so many orcs can be said that because of his judgment mistakes, those are the heroes of the elite of Oufu. And he couldn't forget that a werewolf and an ogre were actually being smashed by the giant claws of Bimen in order to cover him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way down the mountain, Asa has a few pockets of raw ore next to the corpse of the corpse that has not been known for many years. Being able to penetrate the mountains of Sandefes is definitely the top powerhouse. From the high-level magic weapon weapons and staff on the corpse, it can be seen that it should be a well-composed and really strong team. Maybe they are still famous when they are alive. Unfortunately, here are the heroes who bear many stories and legends. The mice in the gutter are dead like silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these bodies, Asa not only got a pocket of ore and two magical pieces of magical leather and some wrist boots. These are the most valuable high-end goods, and there are two well-preserved magic scrolls. It is the good thing he is using now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After carefully looking at the map Asa took all the factors into consideration and repeatedly scrutinized it and finally relieved. From the point of view on the map, it is almost possible to get to Taniguchi at noon according to the current degree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small gap between the two mountains that is the entrance to the deepest part of the Sandefes and the only thing they can reach now. Export. As long as you walk out of the valley, it is very unlikely that the Thunderbird and the Behemoth beasts will emerge from the most dangerous areas of Mount Sandefies. Then, after another day or so, you can reach the safe area where there are backup supplies waiting for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, when the wind is the smallest, it is the only chance to get out of the valley. If at other times, only the strong wind of the swarf of the Tanaguchi can even blow a werewolf. At that time, when they stayed up late into the valley, Asa and the werewolf and the lizard were directly blown in. There was a lizard who was bad luck and was directly slammed into the rock and became a lizard patties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
