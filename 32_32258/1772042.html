			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten days ago, the School of Magic began to study a healing spell using a lot of human organs every day. This kind of research that is contrary to the deceased is not so good that it is easy to be known by most of the students during the day, so it is carried out at night. So every night, Asa will pull a car body and organs from the west to the magic school in the center of Wangdu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These trips these evenings also opened his eyes. He was in the king for two months and he never went out at night. He thought that the nights of every place were as quiet as the hometown, and occasionally a few screams. If you go out at night without a moon, you must bring a torch to prevent a foot from stepping into the pit of the paddy field or falling into a nose and face. You won't be able to climb until the next day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the moon in the sky that illuminates the night of the kingdom, but countless street lights. The lights and noise of the pub will continue until the early morning of the next day. Wearing a dazzling woman standing on the side of the road enthusiastically greeted the passing pedestrians drunks and crooked through the rushing into the alley from time to time vomiting. The luxurious carriage gallops to stop in front of the mansion or to pick up a few noble men and women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people here at night seem to have all the energy they can't use. The song and dance wine banquet is trying every means to make yourself feel happy. It is like tomorrow is the end of the world, and all the life will be exchanged for a little bit of crazy pleasure tonight. Asa did not know why these people had this illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he doesn't want to explore. Even if he walks on the same street every day, he feels completely out of place here as if he is entering a strange world ruled by unknown creatures. The people here also try to ignore his existence. Even if there are occasional drunks to stop him, he wants to find some trouble. Once he sees his face, he immediately runs away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He goes back from the Academy of Magic every day. He has to wait for the study to end the organs and limbs to be used the next day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of the Dukes House is not far from the School of Magic. He will pass there every night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been half a month since I came back. However, the overnight arrest of the Tongyu Wangdu Guard has become a routine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did she explain to her father? Or does she think that I am damn? She knows that her injury is actually killing her? Is it like me to be a wanted criminal in my life? During this time, Asa was very depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study last night went very long until the early hours of the morning. Assana took the list and dragged the empty car to the empty street. The entire king is only quiet around the Magic Academy. Those people are so crazy that they don’t dare to go crazy to the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still some distance from the Duke’s House. He saw two luxurious carriages wearing gorgeous five men and one woman standing outside the carriage and making noises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a common sight of Wang Du night. Asa also did not care to continue walking in the dark. He recognized the woman until he was approached by the fire of the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the same in the team that escorted Otaru’s team, and the same light, thin lips and little squats are also smiling next to Clavis. The appearance is probably her sister. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now her sister is wearing a set of luxurious and exaggerated clothes. The pattern of the head is more exaggerated than the clothes and a few young people who know the aristocratic arguing. Speaking of her, she seems to be going to the Duke's House to take her little hand and pull her hand as if she was asking her to turn around and continue to say a few loud slaps on the face of the little scorpion. The little nephew was angered by the two pairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the common scene of Wang Du night. The young men and women of the nobles always love to inexplicably fight and probably have nowhere to vent their energy. This is also a customary feature in their lives. Asa is still walking in the shadow of the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small nephew seems to be very annoyed. She is not as bad as her sister was hit by a few punches on her head. A few men next to her holding the little scorpion seemed to be the command of the men in the men who ordered them to take her to the car and a few men hesitated and shouted loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa has already walked across the street and heard it clearly. The little nephew said, "What are you afraid of? I am now taking her up, can the Duke still eat me?" Hey, he didn’t have a face, but he didn’t just marry this goods to me?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these few are obviously not ordinary people, and they do not think that they are doing thieves. The little scorpion angry and screamed with a loud voice: "Who is it?" The groom on the car shook with a torch and said, "It seems to be the hunchback assistant of the old man in the west of the city." Asa is now a celebrity. Which identity is it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small nephew stumbled and came over to Asa and said, "You don't want to come over, I will tell you," I walked close to Asa and just smelled it. The alcoholic scorpion suddenly took out a slap from his arms and slammed into his chest and said: "I told you to call someone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stab Half a scorpion feels that the wrist is tight and the hand seems to be gone. A sharp pain that I have never experienced in my life has screamed from the bottom of my heart to the throat, but the painful pain in my throat has knocked this scream back. In the end, he could only make a sound from the nose similar to that before the pig was killed and then fell to the ground and twitched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first twisting of the wrist is purely conditional reflex. The second step is to cut the throat with the palm of the hand but it is a last resort. Compared with these guys, he is more guilty and more afraid of being the person of the Duke's House. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few other men have come to help but have been drunk by the coaches on the two carriages: "You are not opponents." Pulling a long sword from the waist and rushing over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked at the two coaches and took the sword and held the sword and knew that it would not be just an ordinary driver. If you hide the two swords, you can't put your back and don't dare to go all the way. These two are actually quite powerful swordsmen, probably the bodyguards of the little nephew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was finally a chance for Asa to roll out the danger of danger from the encirclement of the two people and toss off the cloak of the body and throw it away at a swordsman. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsman cut the cloak into two pieces with one sword. Sure enough, the experienced fighters did not evade the retreat. The most important thing in this situation is to press the opponent to prevent him from having a chance to adjust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After cutting the cloak, the swordsman saw a red light in front of him. He still didn't understand what it was. The fireball exploded on his nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a small fireball for beginners. The power is not too big. It’s about the equivalent of a few extra large firecrackers tied together. The bones are fragile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One click. The sparkling sparkle on the swordsman's face looked very beautiful in the dark. The beautiful swordsman also fell down quite abruptly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa picked up the half-piece cloak on the ground and threw it at the other swordsman. At the same time, the hand screamed and sang in the mouth with a mantra. In fact, it was a dialect of his hometown dwarfs. At his level, there is no way to use magic continuously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsman hurriedly bowed his head and leaned back to a clean and neat roll. When I first came together, the half-capped cloak had already flew to the front of me and suddenly bumped up and slammed into my chin. Then he clearly heard the cracking bones coming from there and screaming to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, it would be a little unbelievable to put two swordsmen down in Asa. For a long time, there was no activity in the muscles and hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked over to the carriage. When the fire could clear his face, several young people shouted: "Monsters." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wow." A screaming girl suddenly jumped out of the carriage and fled to the ducal palace. It turned out that she was not stunned and was watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afraid of someone hearing the sound came over Asa hurriedly picked up the cloak on the ground and pulled up the empty car to escape into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the Dukes House. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a habit of sleeping in the afternoon until early in the morning. She got up early and had breakfast with her father at the restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She barely slept all night and recalled that period of bizarre experience that was more exciting than alcohol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the eyes that were beaten were still bruised, it still couldn’t affect her excitement and excitement. She told her father about the bizarre experience of last night: “Dad The two bodyguards you know are first-rate, but they are like children under the man's hand. The man's hand is still magical. He will use the magic to smash and blow people away." An exaggerated imitation of the posture of the swordsman falling down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
