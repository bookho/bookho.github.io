			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The infidelity of the rise of the Necronomic Society of the Dead has almost devastated the local economy. The court has paid great attention to it. The proposal that you proposed to form a coalition expressed concern. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough" Bishop Ronis was tired and waved to stop the big priest from continuing to report. If the church is not inexplicably summoning the other two great priests in the past, he really does not like to let this subordinate handle these things. He asked in an old and weak voice: "How was the overnight order prepared?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cusbert Great Officer took out a portrait and clearly painted it The appearance of a young man is shown in the following line: This person was originally a priest of the School of Magic. After investigation, the Association of Necromancers colluded with an extremely dangerous reward of 5,000 gold coins. This is not the same as the elves' ultimatums, not just through the civil society organizations such as the Adventurers Guild and the Thieves, but through the power of the state and the church to search through the entire Big Six. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five thousand gold coins. The total amount of the most dangerous and dangerous thief gang in the past 10 years is only one tenth of this person. As long as this wanted order is distributed, all the bounty hunters and thieves will be nailed to their bedsides and the shape of each of his hairs will be remembered in all ways. The information about what his character is, what he used to experience, the habit of walking with love, and even the posture that he likes to use, is clear. And as long as there is a little bit of a follower about his winds, there are absolutely tens of thousands of followers. Even the degree of being the first beauty in the world and the first genius in the world is so much worthy of being compared with this person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of Ronis’s distracted eyes glanced at the figure that was destined to be remembered in the hearts of countless people. He shook his head and sighed and said: “You have not forgotten the most important thing. Let's just say: You must live your life if you can't hurt him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. I immediately prepared and then informed other people to let go. "The Cusbert Great God official put away the portrait." An ugly face is full of excitement. Even Bishop Ronis can feel that his emotions are a bit too much. "The bishop is so cultivating that he trusts him so he can't think of him actually colluding with the Necromancer..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you quit. I am very tired." Bishop Rooney waved his hand in annoyance. "It's up to you to announce it to others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things finally came to the last step he wanted to take. Although this matter has not been announced yet, it is only a matter of time. As long as this wanted order goes out of his own efforts and hopes, it will be lost. Bishop Ronis closed his eyes and he never felt that he was so old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great God Officer did not withdraw from this small study but stood in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong? Is there anything else?" The bishop squinted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And there is a request from Hamm and the Duke of Mulak to see you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inha M? How is he with the Duke? Let them come in.” Bishop Rooney, although he was a friend but a very personal relationship, rarely met with him on such formal occasions. Today, he is still a little weird with the Duke of Mulak. He suddenly noticed that the big priest seemed to look at him a little differently: "What's wrong? Your heartbeat and breathing are very messy. What are you nervous about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s not just that I think that you have been so cautiously cultivating the priest who can’t think of him, but he has lived up to your efforts.” The big priest’s face is unnaturally swaying. It seems that the excitement just did not pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of Ronis shook his head and did not speak. This subordinate has always been very appreciative of his regular promotion of newcomers. This is also a person who has seen power and gains and losses too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cousbert’s great priest went out with Inham and Duke of Mulak and then came to the Great God to stand behind the Bishop of Ronis and the Marquis The bishop ruled a courtesy: "God is with you as a bishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Ronis nodded slightly and asked: "There is another outside." Who is the footsteps with you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Ronns asked: "Is there anything for the two adults to come to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Mulak stepped forward and said, "I have heard that. The deity official actually colluded with the Necromancer Association. So I will report the situation to you. One night in the last few days. I saw him disappearing from the little girl’s room and fleeing the street. I asked the little girl, although she said nothing, but I can still judge that they must... Hey. I really teach the woman to have a daughter and such a person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I believe that you will not specifically talk about these nonsense." Bishop Ronis waved his hand. He was still so weak and weak, but the flame that had already been weak in his eyes suddenly flashed. He is in a bad mood and is very tired now. He has no interest and no spirit and the Duke to carry out the perfunctory performance of the official practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke smiled and seemed to finally reveal a sly expression that should be consistent with his heart and mind: "I mean if the bishop is really going to catch His words may wish to take the little girl as a bait. Just use the appropriate way to spread the news and let him know that the little girl's critical situation will appear when we expect it." His expression is restored to the beginning of the sincerity. . "I just want to share some worries with the adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames in the eyes of Bishop Rooney condensed the focus on the face of the Duke’s amiable . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed a very simple and effective way to meet the Duke’s unscrupulous approach. But from a certain point of view, this is almost certainly an inevitable trap. The heart of Bishop Ronis was moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the bishop’s attention immediately shifted. He vaguely felt that even this seemingly insidious plan was not the intention of the Duke to come here. He simply did not need to show himself or join him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision of Bishop Ronis did not move away on the face of the Duke. The fat and sincere face should have something unexpected. But now that he is exhausted, he has no energy to think deeper. The vision of Bishop Ronis is involuntarily dissipated. He did not pay attention to the Duke and looked at Inham. "What do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have heard about the news of his escape." Marquis Whispered. "I was surprised."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also felt surprised." Bishop Ronis sighed again and he had already sighed a lot today. He is really old, he thinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I also heard that he didn't even see your face and went away like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Rooney nodded with a powerless posture unique to the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He didn't leave anything for you or what message?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ronnis The bishop shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." The Marquis nodded. Today, his appearance is very strange and there is no anger and vitality in the past. He hesitated and sighed and sighed with helplessness and powerlessness. "In fact, I have something to say to you today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is anything, let's talk slowly. I am very tired."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. It must be said here now." The Marquis's expression was actually serious and dignified with his character's seemingly incompatible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of Ronis waved to both the Duke and the great priest: "You must all retreat first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis actually resolutely said: "No. This is a very important thing. They must also be here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop of Ronis Frowning today seems to be a bit strange to everyone. He is really tired and annoying, but these things are more than inexplicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know that my friends are actually very few." The Marquis stepped forward and his expressions and voices were very down. His voice was very low and he suddenly used the air magic to make the voice unreachable. Only the two of them could hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Ronis couldn't help but sighed a little and nodded. Indeed, he is probably the most experienced person on this point. Although it doesn't seem to be a place to talk about these topics, Bishop Ronis believes that the Marquis does have a special reason why he can feel the unusual feelings in this friend's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis went to the front of Bishop Ronis and reached out and took his thin hands. "And you are one of my friends." The desolate and helpless colors in his eyes are deeper and even sad. His hand is cold and tight and his words are very sincere. "Since she died, you have been very trusting me for the past 20 years. I really treat you as a good friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;罗The Bishop of Nice felt that the back of Cuthbert’s breathing was suddenly heavy and his heartbeat was fast. Probably angry at this very rude behavior of someone he has always been uncomfortable with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former Duke of Mulak is still the sincere and honest expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop is faintly feeling that something is wrong, but there is nothing in it that he can’t say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I have to tell you something now. I know you will be surprised to hear it." The Marquis lowered his head and leaned into the ears of Bishop Ronis. next to. Although their conversation was inaudible to others, he still used this position as if it was really very secret and very embarrassing. His voice is still so sincere. "Do you remember the last time I didn't know from a vampire? That's what I released. I am actually a Necromancer. Today I am here to help them kill you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The light in the eyes of Bishop Rooney swelled and swelled to the old friend who almost turned into two groups of real flames. Shocked and angry, not sad, these expressions instantly huddled on his thin face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is so furious that it is not just because of this confession that he imagined, but also because of the murderousness and the chilly feeling behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No pain is just a squeaky feeling from the outside of the skin immediately into the front of his body almost reached his heart. This seemingly less intense feeling is madly swallowing the vitality of the nearby body and even the magical power in the body has begun to solidify. This is not only poisonous but also a strong curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This knife can only be a masterpiece of Cousbert’s great priest standing behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a despicable knife and a very bad knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priest is by no means a good murderer. From the beginning, his suffocating anger before his breathing and heartbeat was completely abnormal. Even people who are not very smart should be able to avoid it in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Bishop Ronis was not aware of it. Because he is already very tired and already very embarrassed. Even if I noticed the abnormality of this subordinate, I did not go deeper. And the words spoken from the Marquis mouth are so amazing that he has no time to react to the murderousness behind him. So this deadly sneak attack was successful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the success of a sneak attack does not mean that the assassination is successful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White magic instantly surged in the body behind the wounds of Bishop Ronis. There is no need to recite the prayer ‘Bathfire Rebirth’ ‘Exorcism and Destruction’. The two high-level healing magic lights immediately flashed curses and injuries on him immediately. For example, only the light understands the magic of the repair of the big 6 above, even the pope may not be able to beat Bishop Ronis. Whether it is a heavy injury or a curse, as long as it is not the immediate commandment, it can be suppressed under the full force of his white magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Cousbert’s great priest behind him has changed. He was always nervous when he saw the magic of healing magic. He knows the magic level represented by these two high-level healing magics in an instant. He is now the magical power of the old man who has already predicted and imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the assassination scorpion this time and slammed it toward the head and neck of Bishop Rooney. An ugly face was plagued by shackles and tensions that were no longer human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately this knife was only tied to a blue-and-white electro-optical shield that suddenly appeared behind the Bishop of Ronis. A man who screamed at the big priests bounced off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have long known that Bishop Ronis is not good at dealing with it, I did not expect that it would be difficult to deal with this degree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poison on the skull is enough to kill an elephant. But the skinny old man who has been dying for a long time has not only endured it, but he has also been able to knock down the assassin in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even so, the Duke still can’t move without moving. He is already the last link of all plans. If he can't succeed in the whole plan, he will all fail. He must wait until an absolute last chance. It is now the horrible curse of the scorpion and the white magic of Bishop Ronis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only at this time that only the Bishop of Ronis felt that another kind of magical fluctuations had been uploaded from his hand at this very appropriate time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis’s face is still so sad and stagnate. His hand was very tight, and Bishop Ronis couldn’t even pull it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where the magical fluctuations are not too strong or turbulent. Just as the same stocks of stinky mud continue to pour into his body, the body along the way will be stinky and black, and then use the extremely corrosive taste to twitch the magic fluctuations and resonance of the whole body. The two healing spells he had just added to himself immediately collapsed like this in the smell of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Erosion Corruption' This is the double erosion of Necromancer and Dark Magic. If it is not this body, the sacred white magic body is just touching this wave. The moment will turn into a carrion that is not of interest to rats and flies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "You" Bishop of Ronis has been hoarse. The magical force rushed out of his body and began to burst into a white electric spark that immediately condensed into five white-light balls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The anger of the electric elf mine, I am in the name of my life" Bishop Ronis finally found a hoarse mantra. He has given up the treatment to bring all the magic together to attack. The light of the five thundering bombs floated in the void in the sky above him, and the electric light in the middle of the formation of a five-pointed star began to appear as a milky holy light that gradually evolved into a magical array. This is the last blow used at the expense of all his magic and life. As long as his mantra is completed, the three will never fall back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrath of the Titans. This is a curse of the combination of bright magic and air magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is almost a magic that exists only in theory. The magic that can simultaneously cultivate air and bright magic to the top magician is the most important thing. The power of this magic can't control the unimaginable destructive power. It will turn all the things in the square and the surgeon into powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the bishop of Ronis has now used this magic. He is not afraid of hurting innocents and is not afraid that even the entire magic school will be shattered in this powerful explosion. That is better than the Magic Academy and even the entire empire falling into the hands of these three assassins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He already understands that this is a long-awaited assassination and the sinister meaning of the assassination is probably not even the two assassins. He must use this method of doing the same to inform Sander<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time the Duke of Mulak moved. Just as he was moving, the kind and sincere expression was completely gone, and it was replaced by a murderous murderous. It turned out that his fat face, as if born with a kind face, was so majestic once it was completely cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows what it means to be a full-fledged strike by a top great wizard before he dies. He had to wait until the Bishop of Ronis waited until the bishop's magic was nearing the end and could no longer change the tricks before he could shoot his own attack to interrupt his magic at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped forward and slashed his sword to kill all the moves in one go. The fat body now shows cheetah-like rapid agility and coordination. From the moment he moves to the next moment, he has already appeared in the hands of Bishop Ronis. The fine sword is accurately stabbed from the throat of the bishop. Progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the mantra is immediately dumb. The last few characters remain in the throat and there is no way to break through the obstacles of the blade. The stiletto bottom-up from the neck of the bishop's adult is so accurate that he does not even lick the bones to penetrate his medulla. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an injury or death that cannot be recovered by any magic or treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assassination was successful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Duke of Mulak had no easy and happy look on his face. The expression of the big gods who had already turned white on the side of the face began to distort the face and further green. They all looked at the white spheres surrounded by five electric lights floating in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical array has disappeared and the wrath of the Titans has been unable to move the air. The magical magical array has been restored to the normal thunder bombing power than the curse is already The cloud is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even so, these five are still the most aggressive high-level magic in air magic. Only one of them is enough to blow up the room. They may be able to escape by their own abilities or save their lives in the explosion, but everything that is born here will not be hidden in the explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Mulak and the great deity can't stop breathing. These five thunder bombs are only floating in the air. The tiny air flows may also cause them to collide with each other or fly out to touch a wall or other object. The slender eyes of the duke are now in no way the gentleness of the week, like the knives of the knives, stabbing the face of the big gods with the same face as the floor. He is not a magician himself and does not know how to solve the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priest is sober from the fear. He first hugged his hands and pointed at the five thundering bombs in the air and muttered the mantra. This is what I said to the Duke of Mulak: "I don't have such a high degree of knowledge about the air magic. I can only rely on you to find a way to fix the magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come to help you and don't want to die." Duke Mulak said to the Marquis. Although he is not very clear about the Marquis's magic level, he is not sure. This is just a bad guy who has been mixing in the Magic Academy for a while. Now, whether he will remember the magic or not, he will not trust this temporary intimidating helper. But now no one else can count on it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Marquis did not move as he did not hear it. He didn't seem to have just heard that he didn't seem to see the five feet floating on his head that could turn him into a small sauce. His expression was full of sorrow and sorrow, and he still apologized and still held the hand of Bishop Ronis, who had been counted and died. He looked at the bishop’s eyes that were completely closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Mulak stunned this unsuccessful defeated family. There is no time to manage this now. It was impossible for Cuthbert to keep the thunder bombs in the air for a long time and hope that these little things would dissipate themselves. He could only take his own shots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke made a deep breath and took a deep breath. Standing slowly and slowly reaching the slash that had just assassinated the Bishop of Ronis, he slowly sent it to the side of a light ball until his sword and his hand almost slammed the edge of the ball. His hands and shoulders suddenly slammed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fine sword and his wrists are moving at a high level with the naked eye, and it seems to be just shaking. The ball of light began to illuminate and then differentiated into countless tiny white spots scattered in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duchess sighed with relief and this temporary method was really effective. But his forehead also leached a layer of fine sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just because of stress but also because of fatigue. Just now it seems to be only a half-blinking effort. He used his wrist to pull out dozens of swords and the sword is also attached with a sword. This is the destruction of the entire magic structure before the violent magical reaction brewed in the thunderball. . The skill of the sword is full of swaying without any slight deviation. Such a precision, subtlety and quickness to cut down the cost and spirit of the cut is no worse than a big battle. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke set the god again and stood still and slowly stretched the sword forward and swiftly slashed, and the second thunder bomb was completely broken down again. Simple scattered magic elements. The duke's sweat has already fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the third thunder bomb was once again turned into a light spot, there was a small buzz and another two thunderballs under this fluctuating shock. Moved and almost hit each other. The duke stepped back a few steps and passed a burst of flushing and then faded pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke's vest is already soaked. The third sword he had just had a little power, and the degree of swords and swords had defects. The most important thing is that the magical impact of the electric power that came out of the detonation of the ball almost bounced him out. His current right hand shoulder and even half of his body are numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ugly face of Cuthbert is already the same as the dried pig liver. Maintaining such an air-stationary environment seems to be a bit reluctant for his cultivation. Anyone can see that he has not been able to persist for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke closed his eyes and took a deep breath, sweating down his fat face and slamming it down on his chin. He suddenly spit out and opened his sword again. The fourth thunder bomb was finally broken down again. But there was also a muffled sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is not too far away to disturb the people outside the cathedral. Even though the duke is very tired, this sword that concentrates almost all the spirit and energy still almost completely breaks all the magical fluctuations in the thunderball. Only about one-thousandth of the magical force has reacted and gave birth to a small one. explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of this explosion is not even better than a large firecracker, but it is absolutely terrible in the present situation. The last thunder bomb that floated in the air, although not directly exploded, was swept by the next explosion and flew toward the side wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cousbert’s ugly face is black and soft, and the little thing that protects this dying has not been directly transformed into a huge explosion in the shock. The mental power that was originally supported by the effort was exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke’s face is no better. The sword was already in the shortest time and it was impossible to wave it again. And without enough swordsmanship and skill to cut down the magic ball full of devastating explosive power is like taking a burning torch to smash the explosives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thunder of the thunder bombs can be seen clearly. For the first time in the eyes of the Duke, a look of despair was revealed. He never believed in what he taught and he just killed the bishop. He even began to pray for God to give miracles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the miracle is born. Just as the white ball of light was about to hit the wall, it suddenly stopped and then turned a corner and flew out of the small window above. It blinked into the sky and disappeared into the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke squatted for a while before turning his head to look at the founder of this miracle. It is actually the Marquis who has never been there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis put the hand that lifted the air magic down and looked at the duke’s surprised eyes and said faintly: "Nothing, this is not a deep magic. These little tricks just happened." I can grasp it." His look still looked at the body of Bishop Ronis on the ground and sighed with sorrow and sorrow. "Do what you should do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke’s slender eyes squint and do not hide the look of the guard in the Marquis, the graceful look is complete with him. The identity of the swaying artist's identity is sweeping back and forth but there is nothing worth noting. He turned his head and looked at the big priest who frowned from the ground and frowned. "You're fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing." Coosbert gasped. A few breaths shook his head and looked at the strange gaze. He looked at the Marquis, a scum that he had always looked down upon. However, he is not very surprised. This is really not a profound martial art. It is just a matter of mastery of the air magic. Perhaps this scum is like using these little tricks to fool people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke nodded and found some elements of peace from the look of the great priest. He raised his hand and rubbed his face with sweat. He sighed with satisfaction and then hanged his mouth. The smile of his face and the smile of his face completely restored to the kind and friendly state of the week. Just wait for a satisfactory deal. The closing businessman said to Cusbert as easily: "Let's continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cousteau is struggling to get the body of Bishop Ronis Pull the coffee table in the corner and block it in front and go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after, the great priest came in with a person. It was the man who stood outside the door that Bishop Ronis had just heard. He is a 20-year-old young man who is quite tall and tall and looks like Asa with five or six points. He also wears a set of priestly clothes and has a hat that covers half of his face. He was a little cautious and a little curious to look around but immediately bowed his head under the eyes of Cousbert's great priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was originally a street gangster outside a village outside the capital of Wangdu. It was inexplicably caught by several people in the past few days and then these seem to look like The person who was the aristocratic officer said that he had arranged a task for him to complete a great reward. I can't think of being dressed like this today and brought it to the magic school of Wangdu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priest took a small skin from his arms and threw it at the young man and said, "Put this on yourself." The young man opened the skin inside. A small bag of blood. He poured the blood on himself and his face as directed by the great priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
