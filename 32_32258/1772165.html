			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bonfire scatters the last rays of the light to shine on the trees. There are only four shadows beside the campfire, and the two of them are lying on the side of the fire. The most important thing is that the mental ups and downs make them tired to extremes. . Now even if someone puts two knives on their ass, they don't necessarily wake up immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two are young Abin and Druid Anderson seem to sleep equally heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika also Hilton and several other people are not at the campfire. They are also tired and even more tired than the two magicians. It is the life and death of the day and they are the most powerful. But they did not sleep together beside the warm campfire. These people who are soaked in killing and fighting for a living, like instinct, will never show their unsuspecting attitude in front of people who only know each other. Moreover, they also know that they will sleep very hard in this field. They are all separated from each other by a few hundred meters away from the fire. The woman Jessica is sleeping on a big tree next to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an hour after they start taking a break. This is usually the time when people sleep the deepest and deepest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure next to the bonfire suddenly turned over and turned a nightmare voice. The three people next to me didn't react to this sound and still didn't move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a half-hearted man who turned over and twisted his body and made a louder voice. The fire reflected on his face was originally Abin. Probably he didn't have much effort in the daytime battles, so he didn't seem to be too hard to sleep. But the three next to him still slept very badly and nobody cares about him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin’s eyes slowly opened a slit and turned over and then completely opened. There was no drowsiness in it, as if I had just washed the ice bath. He slowly sat up and looked at the three people who were still asleep and slowly stood up again. Every movement of him is very slow. Be careful not to make any noise. He carefully looked around the surrounding environment and slowly walked in one direction. It is the direction of the unknown man and the horsewoman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trees in the middle of the night are definitely not quiet. The myriad of insects and the sounds of the nighttime animals are intertwined and can even be said to be very lively. But Abin knew that even one of them sounded strangely. For example, when people step on the grass and the animals are completely different, the sound is enough to make those people wake up. Those people even die if they sleep. The vigilance will never die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it’s not a long distance. Abin was slightly out of sweat. After finally circumventing a few trees, he saw the horsewoman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight was loaded in the huge pocket like a big parcel and thrown in the haystack. The blood and dust on her face made her look very Wolverine, but the outline of the five senses is still bright and beautiful in the moonlight, but it is a little pale. Her life should be no danger, as long as the life of the person wearing the brilliance of the glory of the armor will automatically move the white magic of the 'bathing rebirth' although not used in the hands of the bishops so magical. But at least it can keep a minimum of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this, she has been comatose. When the man who grabbed her man in the basement slammed the position of her head and neck with a few moments of precision, she immediately surprised Hill and several others. Beyond this, Abin also felt that the man seemed to have used a little magic, a very strangely weak curse. These are added together enough to make the female knight stun for a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin saw the horsewoman but his heart was not happy at all, but his nerves were tightened. Because he only saw the unconscious female knight and did not see the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abbott concentrated all his attention. I heard the sounds and signs that there were no abnormalities around me. But he didn't understand how the woman knight was lying alone, but the man was gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the other thing about men? It may be that the man left the horsewoman alone and went to sleep somewhere else... but for whatever reason, this may be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Abin bites the tiger and continues to walk towards the female knight. At this point, there is no room for retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, he also understands that this behavior is really adventurous and even in some ways can be called stupid, as long as there is a little accident, there is no longer Any room for change here is everyone's role in killing people and not being blind. But on the impulse of the surging in the chest, he could not ignore this woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the old man of Relas has never slackened from a small teaching, he has never been a devout believer. It was not until this time that he had the power of confession and prayer that he thought was boring. He couldn’t help but pray. He didn't know and didn't care if there was a god who would hear his voice. He just had to let these pious statements cover the screams that might appear at any time in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I finally learned that the woman was temporarily okay. He was relieved and tired of feeling that he had never been so tired. A thought popped up in his mind: find a chance to put the woman down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he immediately denied the idea himself. Whether it is the thief collar or the mysterious man can immediately kill himself when he has this attempt, even if he succeeded in the thousand gold coins? How can I take my sister to go to the big 6 to seek medical treatment without money? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the conversation with the Druid he suddenly thought of a way to save the female knight, which may be a shortcut to his goal. Although the opportunity is less dangerous, but combined with the impulse of the heart, it immediately becomes irresistible. Today's battle will definitely make these people very tired. They have not yet joined other thieves and they are still resting separately... This is definitely a good time<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maybe still There is one of the most important reasons that he does not realize. That is, he does not want to delay. I don't know when those people will start with the woman. So he touched when everyone was asleep and touched him to save people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purification is in the hands of a woman who is about to be applied to the knight. Abin suddenly saw a pit on the haystack around the knight. This is obviously formed after a person is lying there. He couldn't help but put his hand on it. The body immediately condensed like a statue of a stone. The haystack is very dry. The remaining temperature of the human body remains on the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather is not too hot. The remaining temperature left above did not dissipate, which means that the person just left less than five minutes. Almost the same time as he quietly got up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought you would be more patient." A voice rang softly behind his back. "And I told you that if you wake up this woman in this situation, she will wake up the pigs who are sleeping inside and outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin It took a lot of effort to finally turn over the head slowly. He saw the divine man standing there like a ghost in a few steps behind him. At this moment, he only felt that the pores of the whole body had condensed into ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still plain that it will disappear into the crowd immediately. The face is as flat and indifferent as it used to be. There is no slight expression in the bleak moonlight. This looks like a long-lost person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin’s unconsciously moved to the waist with a long sword. But he did not really go to the sword. Really moving his hand, he didn't even have a chance to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if you want to save at least you should be well prepared. There are detailed arrangements or notices to design a good trap to distract our attention and create for ourselves. Opportunity. I don’t think you just saw us taking a break and thought it was a good opportunity to come here. It’s too disappointing. I saw you in the basement and I thought you were very good.” The face of a dead person is the same. The voice of this person is also cold and powerless. "And your observation and feelings are not enough. Do you know? You come here and start. If you want to kill you, you are enough to die a hundred times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Abin did not have the stiff posture that Hu kept for too long. He slowly turned around and stood up and looked at the pale, cold face and took a deep breath and cautiously asked: "Well, I am not dead yet, I can't say... I may not die." The voice is very light and the same as this man. Such a soft voice in the sound of insects will never affect the few people in other directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpse-like face suddenly had a smile. Although this smile is definitely not good or even a bit strange, it is a smile. The man gently said: "In this case, I have not lost my calmness and can observe and think. This does not seem too disappointing. You are not so stupid this time. If you pull out the sword, you will be shocked by other people." The eyes are up. "I promise you will die worse than this female knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin did not speak. He only felt his heart jump four or five times faster than usual. . The strange taste revealed in this weird smile and discourse made him suddenly feel that he had the luck of the legendary escape from the dragon and the ability to win the treasure. He whispered, "You...want me...do what." The over-stress made his voice a little awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can kill her but... I can't watch her being tortured to death by you." Think about it. Yabin answered this sentence. Although he knows that every sentence now determines his life and death must be a word of arbitrarily, but in addition to this sentence seems to be unreasonable, he really can not find other reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out to be such a reason. Childish." Although it is said that the man seems to understand the seemingly unreasonable reason to understand the smile on the pale face. It is obvious that you can feel the ridicule of the place. "And this impulsive behavior is also young and childish. Childish will make your own judgment mistakes feel bad. Childish will kill yourself. You know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Now know." Abin nodded slowly. The voice is a little crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But everyone is coming from childishness." The man's voice actually had a hint of insensitivity. "You have just given yourself a chance to win a chance. I will give you one more now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abbie’s heart has already mentioned the sound of the throat Because of over-stress, he was a little embarrassed and he slowly asked: "Yes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man whispered: "I can let you take this horsewoman." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;乍 Listen to this sentence. Abbin only felt that his heart had almost smashed out of his mouth. It was hard to regain calm. He knows that there is something behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But just like the one just now. The opportunity is to fight for yourself. I let you go but you can't walk away and see yourself." Point your finger at the direction of several other people. "They know that your shooter will never be able to save people without my awareness. So I will call them together to chase you. If we catch up with them..." The light in his hand on his neck is colder than ice. "You should know that I am not a chance to speak to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes..." Abin nodded his teeth and nodded anyway. Better than no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man untied a pair of shoes from the waist and pointed in one direction: "You better carry this woman to the side. There is a The river and the shoes are loaded with the magic of 'watering'. You should be able to use this magic item if you can magic. The chance of you running this escape can be much larger."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin has taken over the shoes. This is a pair of leather boots that look like nothing. In many places, it can be seen that this is still a very old thing. You can feel the fluctuation of the subtle water magic in your hand. Mechanizedly put on this escaped baby, his heart was a mess. Just now I thought that I had reached the point where the mountains were running out of water. But inexplicably there is such a turn. This ups and downs make him feel a little unreal. She can’t help but look at the man and ask: "Why do you want to... let me go..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now tell you it anyway." The man's eyes flashed a glimmer of light, and the vivid light was not in harmony with his dead face. "Actually, I originally wanted to find a chance to put this woman in the way I want to let her go without causing other people's doubts. Since you want to be a hero, this black pot will ask you to carry it back."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin’s mouth was immediately enlarged and it’s a mess. He couldn't figure out what it was all about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you escaped, tell this woman about the group of people we are going to in the forest of Tula, but it is best not to tell her that I am It’s okay to let her go.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This...what is going on?” Abin never thought he was stupid but now he only feels himself Probably less than a puppet. "Can you still ask your name? Who are you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too much curiosity is also a childish one. If you live It’s not a bad thing to know that it’s not a bad thing. You just need to know that you have a chance to escape now and have the opportunity to fulfill your childishness.” The man stepped back and hid in the shadow of the trees to make a gesture to Abin. gesture. "If you want to call me in front of the woman, I can say that I am Sandefez."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. I know." Abin took a deep breath. All the distracting distractions are all driven out of my mind. Now is not the time to worry, but the time to concentrate on escape. He added praying and strength agility to himself with the lowest voice. In the end, it gathered together to give the female knight a treatment that was all possible to achieve maximum effect and then purify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
