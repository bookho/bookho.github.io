			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance of the kilometer in the Lancelot's full force of the Holy Cross under the sword, the huge swords and the holy light rise to the sky. The huge body of the corpse has only been able to break through the Great Light Sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpse of the corpse of the sky is first divided into two from the middle and then the complete ice-disintegration has just condensed together and is more flexible than any creature. The body immediately collapsed. The power of this sword is not only the shape of the corpse, but also the magic of the dead spirits in the rising spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for death." Sandro did not panic and snorted and looked at the sword of the Great Light, which was passed by, and then went so fast. It is far from possible to hurt him. The broken corpse automatically condensed at the foot of Sandru and became a small corpse to catch him. He had already grabbed a corpse of corpses and threw a black skull to face Lancelot. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of a sword playing Lancelot is gradually revealed in the scattered swordsmanship. The situation is gone. This is the room for the height of the kilometer. A strong warrior can only be a live target for a magician under such circumstances. But Sandrud also quickly said to Asa at the same time he said: "Flee."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot is such a superficial swordsman with his own The whole blow of the safety can be ignored, not only to defeat the corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the ordinary elves on the war tree have left the two towers of the Pope’s Tower and the last shrine of the church Sylvia and Caitlin*. Just as Sandro threw out the magic in his hand when he turned to Lanslot, the Pope also raised his hand to Tianzhu: "Purification in the name of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp A burst of white light burst before the group of carrion thrown by Sandru. The carrion, together with the necrotic magic that condenses on it, is completely dissipated in front of the white light like the ray of ray. Purification is only a small spell in white magic. Even if it is so far away, the Pope can operate it in the same way. Since it is white magic from his hand, it is enough to help Lancelot resist this fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A woman is still not enough for a woman." Elder Lloyd faintly shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the meeting of the School of Magic, he and the pope saw the unusual look of the female prime minister. Just in case there are a lot of secret whistle guards around the prime minister's house, there are naturally people who have the head of Roland, and the visits of Sandu and Inham are naturally beyond them. Then I went to a little bit to test the tone. Only from the look of the prime minister, they guessed that she had already leaked the secret. I immediately rushed over with the delivery reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloogan adults have come, but he has no time to pay attention to the battle above. He was turning around the altar like an ant on a hot pot. He shouted and screamed in a coma. Gru reached out and touched it but didn't dare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to Gruid? Please help me come over and see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Elder Lloyd only glanced at him and shook his head and said, "You don't have to worry about it. The creatures that are eroded by the black star can only be destroyed, even the dragons and the titans. It can only be supported because of the leaves of the world tree. Power. The rest of the sun well water can dispel the breath and let him continue to live. It is impossible for him to restore his original state. He is useless to us."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Useless? You old guy. If this is heard by any orc, your only end is to be swallowed and digested into a group..." Bolugan roared The elf elder looked at it but then had to look at it with a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Absolutely not let them escape." Elder Lloyd did not pay attention to Bolugan. Turned over and spit out these words. The wrinkles on his face seemed to be more and more seemingly even struggling to stand up as if he had been so old that he would fall into a pile of rotten meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Waiting for the first-class elders." Luya opened her mouth until this time she could wake up from the shock and watch the Pope and Lancelot over the sky. "How come you suddenly get in touch with the people in the church? Have you forgotten what the last time the Knights of the Temple did? How can we help the church people deal with him? It is he who helped us to overcome many times..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no eternal enemy. Of course there are no friends forever. The situation changes and the position naturally changes. Now our friends are them. Not him." Lloyd The elder slowly spit out these words from the mouth that was almost drowning in the wrinkles, with helplessness and sorrow in the old decay. "Forget it. You don't have to understand these things, but I am enough..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the high air, Sandru and Asa's surrounding air suddenly cooled down. The water vapor condensed countless huge snowflakes and then the wind swelled. The sky of this piece suddenly became a huge snowstorm that ravaged countless palms and cut the corpses of the sky into smaller pieces and then frozen them into ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This blizzard magic power is innocence. If you deal with a large army like this, the violent freezing and storms are enough to cut thousands of ordinary soldiers. It doesn't make much difference to people like Asa and Sander. The temperament slightly condenses these water vapor condensed snowflakes and cuts them on Asa and immediately smashes them themselves. And Sandy has surrounded a layer of black halo. If all the snowflakes are close, they are all silently melted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the purpose of this magic is not actually to kill people. Sander’s better living corpses under the foot of Asa immediately disintegrated under the blizzard and broke into countless ice slag. Sandro snorted and couldn't reach the re-emergence of the magic in his hand and threw it at Lancelot. He turned and caught the fallen Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go." Granden Tower also raised his hand and pointed the living dead and two people across the distance of a kilometer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of catching Asa’s body, the body of the living body suddenly fell to the next sinking and seemed to be unable to withstand the weight of the two and then fell straight to the old tree. This drop is getting faster and faster, even faster than the early fall of Landslot. Finally, the two of them had to jump at the same time and jumped away from this living corpse monster to slow down the fall with feathers. The degree of the death of this living body is not reduced at all, but the height of more than 100 meters is even faster to burn with the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpse that slammed into a bang and finally fell to the ancient tree of war. The old trees and the dead bodies were thrown deep. The deep crater seemed to sway even the entire old tree. This small living corpse actually has such a drop of the road like a tens of thousands of pounds of meteorite falling from nine days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living corpse in the pit is still moving like a person who is stepping on a foot but not dead, but also struggling to stand up and flutter like this It’s an agile abnormal corpse monster. Now every movement is slow like a snail. A cold current passed. This wreckage instantly condensed into a piece of blue-white ice and then the densely wrecked wreckage was completely smashed by the force of tens of times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aidley and Grandtenta masters only took the two top elemental magicians together, this living body has completely destroyed Shande Lu’s magical power is ten times higher and it’s impossible to operate the corpse that has been broken and can’t be broken and the most subtle part of the body is destroyed by freezing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Lancelot. Everyone has a lot of spare time to deal with any sudden situation. But each of them is already a top-ranking power in all fields, even if there is no prior negotiation, but the way to attack each other is seamless. Now the two people in the open space can only rely on the feathering technique to slowly descend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The young man seems to have anti-magic enchantment?" Granden Tower frowns. He was supposed to pull Asa down together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He didn't have a good deal with the gown of the Ghost King." Magnus squinted and looked at "<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the air. Asa has put the gown of the Ghost King on. Otherwise, just a small amount of gravity field can kill him and Sandu together.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of wearing this robes after a long time is completely different from the previous ones. It seems that this robes have become part of the body's extension of the body's breath, gradually increasing between the fibers of the robes and then Spread out in a strange way to form a circle of force fields related to his gas.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey the old man. It seems that it is not good. I don't have a transfer reel. do you have it? "Asa is in the air.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. Even if they are there, they will never give you the opportunity. "Shandro's face is hard to see.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That may really want to escape and can't escape." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru’s eyes are all full of bloodshot. Heavier is the murderous and dead air that permeates the eyes. He just looked at the ground. Turning around and looking at Lancelot in the same air, it is the most vulnerable object to kill now. It is also the most obstructive opponent.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Attack the Necromancer." Elder Lloyd ordered the Elven Patrol. The black bow of Kailin’s hand screamed a thunderous roar and took a thick green light straight into Sandro in midair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This I can't stop." Just watching the female elf bow, Asa was yelling. He understood the power of the black bow. It was the weapon left by the founder Ella Isabella of the Tula Forest. It was said to have been the phantom bow of the elves used to keep the whispers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need for him to call Sandru and understand that he has to turn his head and pour all the anger and killings into the oncoming green arrow. A tooth screaming in the middle of his finger turned into a dead white and white shadow shot just into the green light that was about to hit him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green arrow is full of buckets and such an arrow has once killed several of the * divisions even if they are wearing the Ghost of the Ghosts now. May not stand this arrow. And the trajectory of the teeth flying out is very thin and fierce. The green light is more than a small, disproportionately empty scream. Before the green roaring roar, it is like a struggling struggle. But as soon as the tooth hit the arrow, the arrow suddenly disappeared. Like a scam of illusion, it collapsed and the tooth was not damaged. Still, the whistling sound of the screaming screaming along the original trajectory ran toward the underside of the elf archer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katelin* has been preparing for this. It is a thick ice wall with both hands facing out and condensed in the air. Sylvia also pushed Kailin out of exhaustion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Elf Archer is definitely the most attacking and most vulnerable here. The reason why the two Knights of the Knights did not participate in the attack is to be ready to help. Other people defend. Even if the surrounding elites are all against the mid-air, the Necromancer is already taking advantage of them and they are not slack in spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Asa also shot two dead spirit fireballs colliding in midair. Then it was scattered into the sky full of green fire and rain. It's a pity that the magic level of his half-hanger has no effect on this level of magical battle. Aideli just waved a huge blue water curtain and turned all the fire and rain into nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Sand's shot attracted the attention of everyone else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice wall in midair is wide enough, even if the thunder bombs are enough to resist, but now it seems that there is no slight effect. The teeth are worn without any hindrance. Leave a small hole in the top. At this time, the Elf Patrolman has been pushed open but the teeth are also bent out of a strange arc that is still shining towards her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of magical dodge is not the best way. Sylvia's sacred guardian shield has been lightly condensed into a small diamond shape that is right in front of the white tooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No collisions and sounds were just like the screaming screams of the dying old woman, and then Sylvia slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Guardian Shield, which claims to be able to withstand any attack, is not broken or condensed on the arm of the Knights of the Temple. It just has a small hole like the ice wall. The same Sylvia's chest also had a small hole that was small or even bloodless, and his people were still moving there and not even moving their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice wall that condenses in the air first falls off a crush. The bang is loud. The knight of the shrine was suddenly broken. Just so strong and powerful people. Suddenly it was completely and completely scattered as if he had been huddled together with a pile of flour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The armor and the clothes on him are still there. It’s just that all of his body, body organs, bones, and even tooth hairs are all shattered. All the things that are wrapped together into a pile of inexplicable paste slowly flow around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Patriots were so scared that they didn’t even seem to scream. If it wasn't for Sylvia, it would be her to block this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot has landed with the help of the owner of the Granden Tower. It is natural to see the muscles in this face. It’s all bloodshot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that no one, including him, has any change. It’s just watching Samuel and Asa fall slowly with the feathers. . Everyone knows that the protective ice wall and the holy guardian shield that the division is concentrating on are not able to resist. They are also unsure of it. And Sand's current action shows that the next thing thrown out can only be better than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandro did not throw this blood. This is the power of the dead spirit of the self-mutilated body and can only knock down one person at a time. Others who are ready will never give him another chance to shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men fell slowly on the top of the old tree during the feathering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be cautious, you only have one chance to shoot." The Pope suddenly spoke to Sandru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One time is enough." Sandro was all bloody when he laughed at his white teeth. Asa, who was next to him, felt his hair swaying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not enough. We have a lot of people." The Pope shook his head. "You can only choose one. If it is me and the two tower owners, you have 80% of the grasp. If it is Lancelot, you will only have a maximum of 40%. At least I will help him to resist. If there are two people to help him resist you There is no grasp of the two layers. How much do you have to grasp the resistance of other people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you don’t have any use for it." Pope I paused and said. "Your purpose is to let this kid escape. But do you think that if you are subdued, he will escape? Even if he will escape, even if he has a ghostly king's robe, he is surrounded by Lancelot and the tens of thousands of elves here. Underneath, can you have a little bit of escaping? If you put on that thing, you can really be unscrupulous. You should be clear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope turned and turned Asa said: "Even if you can escape so many people on this big 6 can escape? All your loved ones. Can friends escape? You will die when you escape."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't say so great, why don't you die?" Shandrew sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I die, I don't mind going to die." The Pope replied loudly that the gloomy face that belonged to Adela was resolutely determined. "People are alive and responsible. Don't be so selfish for yourself. Don't be weak and avoid being a man. Take it on your own."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to be here Preaching that your body is taking possession of other people's poor worms, what responsibility does he have?" Shandrew laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I mean your responsibility." The Pope jerked his head and looked at Sandro. "If it wasn't because of your willfulness 20 years ago. How could it be that today's escape from the past two decades? You already know the life of this kid, but you don't do anything and tell you about him." What are you afraid of? Now I feel the conscience uneasy? I owe him? Want to use your own life to change his life? You are better than Vad Nina, but you only have your own eyes..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop." Shandru raised his hand to the Pope. The bright red blood flashed in his hands. Like a bloodthirsty leprechaun. The color in his eyes is even redder and brighter than this light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this action. The atmosphere that was already tense to the extreme immediately reached a pole. The magical fluctuations echoed among several top magicians like a huge volcano that was invisible and was being sprayed out of the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough." Asa finally spoke. Gently patted Sandro's shoulder. "He said that I will not escape. This will not solve any problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." The murderousness in Sandro’s eyes It turned into anger and turned to look at Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s face was calm and just shook his head and nodded again: “Thank you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Everyone doesn't have to be nervous, I already know what you have to do. If you want to escape, I have already escaped." Asa looked at the Pope and Lancelot and sighed. "Although you are all enemies, I have at least a hundred reasons to kill you, but I have to admit that what you said is justified. I can't escape or escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;With him, everyone is relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Audley had to look at him with the peach-like eyes and then turned to look at Luya’s shrug like she said to her and said to herself. "It's a good man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope and Lancelot both nodded and their looks were complicated. It is said that if Asa really can kneel down, Sander himself is desperate to escape and they have no confidence to leave him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
