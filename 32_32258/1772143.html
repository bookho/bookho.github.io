			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground's tremors are getting more and more intense, and even the dullest ogres are also aware. He quickly dropped the original mine pockets and gripped the already ruined steel shield to look at the valley with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This steel round shield is the best and only one of the most deliberately built equipment for this trip to the Sandefes. Mengli claws something. The diameter of the shield is one meter and a half curved. The thickest part of the shield is seven inches thick. Although it has been designed by the dwarf craftsman to ensure the quality while minimizing the weight, it still weighs a thousand pounds. The ogres must lift their hands at the same time to wave. freely. The hardness and strength of the specially treated steel of Oufu Blacksmith can be used to make a good weapon shield. The arc of the right can remove a considerable part of the impact. The grip behind the shield is also inlaid with a valuable piece of magic. Gemstones add strength and toughness. In some ways, this is no longer a shield, but a narrow wall that is refined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, both the weight and the defensive performance are absolutely in the shape of a large 6-pointed armor that seems to have been distorted and not looked carefully and thought it was a group of scrap. During this time, this shield is able to withstand the contact and collision of each other's claws every day. The shield is concave and deformed because the shield's toughness and strength can be sustained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is getting smaller and smaller. It can be heard that the shock is slowly getting bigger and bigger in the air. Although Bimon has a huge body, he can't run any kind of biological reaction and agility in the big 6 and can even be compared with the werewolf. This is why Asa simply does not dare to expect to escape by escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lizard man West also put down the ore pocket and took out the last venomous magic arrow on the steel. Jumped on a bump on the side of the cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The toxin on the magic arrow is made by Cedrus, but the poison on this arrow can kill a hundred horses. But even such a poison is very limited for the monsters of the Big Ben, which is probably the strongest monster on the Big Six. The weak magic that was originally attached to it was proved to be futile in this period of time. All creatures living in the valley are almost completely ineffective because of the magical fluctuations in the environment, in addition to the white magic that drives and influences their vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alkin and Luken’s ears stand straight and continue to capture the sullen footsteps of the air holding the flail of the flesh. Excessive tension caused them to open their mouths and whisper screams to reveal sharp teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luken shouted to Asa with the sound of calmness and restraint: "There is still about three kilometers northeast of the northeast and about half a minute later, it is surrounded by the cliff." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nodded and held the knife in his right hand and held the reel of the paralyzed hand to the two werewolves: "Leave the weapon. Lose the armor." I will definitely not attack the attack and dodge it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two werewolves stunned. Any werewolf will never retreat in the face of disparity and big battles. They are still the most recognized warriors in the family. This kind of words is simply the biggest insult to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Leave your weapon and take off your armor." Asa repeated it lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luken first dropped the weapon and silently took off his leather armor. Alkin slammed the weapon and armor after sighing with a weird accent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When dealing with gray beasts and eagle owls, the comprehensive combat power of the werewolves can be reflected to the fullest, but Bimeng is completely different. Even in the face of an ordinary Biman, their weapon, which is a nightmare for ordinary humans, does not cause much harm. Moreover, this is still a larger beast with a thicker fur and a thicker body. It’s better to go to him and scratch it. The smuggling of the ogres under Bimon's claws is also the only effect of destroying other armor, but it only hinders dodge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa commanded the corpse to put the ogre, which had been comatose because of the injury, into the crack next to it and jumped on it again. The top of the head. This corpse is nothing but an ordinary Bi Meng and has been broken. I can't expect it to withstand the impact of a giant beast. It is to try to create a giant beast to make Asa when the moth reel is in effect. Opportunity and time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asamuel cursed the knife and reversed a knife in his hand to cut a knife and put it on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa's face was white. This is the first time he has used such a method of self-harm. Sandron once warned him that although he can temporarily improve the special effect and power of the knife, the magical counterattack and the damage to the body are equally dangerous. This method is a double-edged sword that can never be used in a critical moment. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are small stones that have been shaken from the cliffs on both sides as if the whole earth was shocked by this huge monster that has not yet appeared. Luken’s face became more and more ugly and he screamed at Asa: “Be careful that this thing is at least ten meters high. I will see it right away.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voice Just a huge figure turned from a cliff far away. Far from the same huge shape and claws, all the furs are gray and white. The height of the ten meters is almost the same width and thickness as the height. It is simply a moving mountain of meat. The mouth of the blood that occupies half of the head can swallow a tooth in a cow's mouth. It is a pile of long swords that are densely packed together. The canine teeth are more than one meter long. Like gorillas, but more tens of times more limbs, the nails that grow on the thick palms are called the 6 most horrible weapons. Each of them has the sharpest curved shape of the inverted blade and the shortest is two meters long. The destructive power of these horrible natural two-handed swords under the more terrifying power of Bimon is by no means comparable to any human weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This behemoth finally saw the prey with an earth-shattering roar. The fresh smell of the ogre and the werewolf spurred the rock that caught it next to it. The hard granite on the wall immediately collapsed like a crispy bread. Then it ran a stout short leg and flew over here, and the saliva dripped all the way from the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This distance is much faster in the footsteps of the behemoths. As its tremors approaching the ground, it is getting more and more powerful. The entire valley is filled with the footsteps of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only West couldn’t see anything different. The lizard's face has no muscles to express emotions. Everyone else, even Asa’s expression, is slightly twitching. No matter what kind of warrior sees such a giant monster with such a mighty power, it is impossible to have any courage and fighting spirit, even ignore the huge minions, but only the weight of hundreds of thousands of pounds, even if pressure Anyone can be pressed into a patties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolfman Luken’s ear that had been pulled down suddenly suddenly stood up again. He carefully sideways and then kneel down and put his ear to the ground. It seems that even the footsteps that the body feels are still not clear enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone saw Luken’s move but had no time to think about why he did it. Everyone is watching the behemoths approaching quickly. The huge body is getting more and more irresistible pressure. Even the tall and majestic ogre seems to be a dwarf goblin in front of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luken on the ground seemed to be slammed into the ear like a knife. Tension and fear made his face look awkward. He turned his head and snarled at Asa. His voice was almost inaudible in the deafening footsteps but everyone heard it clearly. "There is also a sudden emergence of two kilometers in the same direction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Asa’s body almost fell off the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the inferiority of the Sandefes and the huge food consumption of Bimen, this monster has to kill each other because of lack of food. It is the only natural enemy. No matter what kind of food, it will not let Biman ignore a kind of kind that may be directed at himself. The only possibility is that these two Bi Meng are companions in a certain sense. This is their common territory. In other words, they need to deal with two comparisons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The behemoth in front of them is only a hundred meters away from them. The low screams and footsteps from the mouth of the blood basin rolled together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre made a noise as if to fight against the footsteps and waved the shield in his hand to rush forward. Alkin's eyes also began to be congested. It’s just that in front of this monster, they don’t know if they can deal with two. The fear of death has provoked the extreme fear of the animal nature deep in their souls that have been transformed into incomparable fighting spirit and courage. They are already on the verge of madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silence." Asa screamed with the strength of tearing his own vocal cords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear and fighting spirit are madly stirring in the soul. He is very familiar with him and knows what the orcs will do. But the courage of renewed fighting spirit will not fill the gap in absolute strength. They ran weakly and daringly rushed to the face and died as much as they did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the orcs heard the voice of Asa, they all remembered that they had a full understanding of this human ability and had full trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa re-reverses the knife and mourns the mantra again. This time he cut off his wrist. The arterial rupture of blood rushed out but when it encountered the blade, it was all sucked up like a sponge. The dark red light on the knife body became thicker and thicker and the knife began to tremble slightly as if it were a blood shadow that had to be broken at any time. The mantras condensed into a singular magical symbol in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpse silently started to hedge against the behemoth almost twice as tall as himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knife leaves the wrist. Asa only feels cold in the hands and feet and the magical power in the body is already empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, Sandro is invisible. If he can see the situation here, he will be too angry. Because Asa is not using a double-edged sword, it is simply the first sword to stab himself and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is half dead but the knife in his hand seems to have life. A burst of humming sound began to sound from the knife. It sounded small, but it penetrated the footsteps and howls of the earth-shattering like a wire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpse and the behemoth have already rushed together. Just as the giant beast lifted his claws, Asa unrolled the reel. A burst of magical light flashed into the behemoth's body in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed with relief. Sure enough, this white magic is still effective against this monster. The rest will be easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this opportunity, the corpse plunged into the arms of the behemoth and stabbed his claws into his chest and abdomen. But this is definitely not a fatal injury. This giant beast is too big and too strong. And the toughness of the white fur is far more than the other two than the two claws are not too deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is the original intention of Asa. Because to face the next second, he could not directly kill this monster. He jumped from the head of the corpse to the head and neck of the behemoth and shouted at the lizard who was taking the opportunity to aim at the eyes of the beast: "Don't put an arrow. Try to delay the other one."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beasts are all wrong. But Asa didn't think about what they were going to do to delay the mighty behemoth. He only had time to scream and add a command: "There is one of the most important exports. Don't die in front of everyone." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other Bi Meng appeared at this time in the sight of the orcs. It’s a very similar adult. It is rushed here in the same direction in the same direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray hair that stepped on the monster was actually pierced into the sole of the foot like a steel needle through a leather boot. The pain of the heart has caused Asa to feel a little embarrassed because of excessive blood loss. Asa lifted the knife and stabbed the dark red knife and easily and silently pierced the neck of the behemoth. Even the skin of Lie Meng's claws can't be broken at random. Under this knife, it is like a ruin. Asa almost stuffed both the handle and the hands into the body of Bimen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can feel the knife breaking open the skin and muscles into the blood vessels with the thickness of the bucket. But there is no blood like a mountain spurt or even a trace of blood and smell. Asa only felt that the knife in his hand was screaming in the nickname. He was carrying the blood and magic on the knife and running in a frenzy with Bimen's blood in one's vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This top-level reel only lasted a little more than a second. A roar of the entire Sandefis Mountains can be echoed from the huge mouth of Bimen. Not only the two werewolves, but the ogres have left their shields and covered their ears. Bimon's beast finally recovered his mobility, but it didn't take care of the two giant claws on his chest. Instead, he changed his direction and slammed into Asa on his neck. Don't wear your neck together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpse slammed into the ground and grabbed the giant claws of the giant beast. The giant claws were dragged to the next two, and the huge nails of Asa’s body rubbed his head and slammed into a loud noise, but he could not hear. The roar of the behemoth in his ear has already made his ear lose the function of listening. It only feels that warm blood is flowing under the nose and the corner of the eye. I feel that even the brain and blood in my head are almost shocked into a pot of rotten bean dregs. He almost has to use all his strength to ensure that he does not faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa's operation of the corpse completed this last action and the hand gripped the handle. He could feel the unimaginable vitality of this monster in his body, and he was going to grab it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bi Meng Beast screams madly waving his forearm to get rid of this ant-like tiny creature hanging on his neck. Although there was only a little injury there, some strange feelings scattered into it from the inside made him instinctively aware of the dangers that had never been seen before. But the corpse was firmly hung on its arms and the claws were pinched into the gaps in the bones. The more hard he felt, the more pain he felt in the bone marrow. He desperately twisted his short neck and opened his mouth, but even if he could clearly smell the smell of the little cock, he couldn't help it. So it began to jump like a mad bang on the rock. But no matter how it struggles, the people hanging around his neck are not moving. Slowly, the action of the behemoth began to slow down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stinking strong air that screamed at the head and neck of the behemoth was thrown into the body, but Asa did not feel that his spirit had With the blood on the knife in his hand, he already felt that this life has begun to weaken. His only thought is to re-extract the knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the orcs also greeted the second behemoth that rushed over as the Asa said. Although they really don't know how to block and delay this one, they have to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre made a roar and slammed the shield toward this one. It’s just that his original majestic body has not yet reached the waist of Bi Meng. It looks like a toddler who is just learning to walk with a toy weapon and rushes to a sturdy man with a weapon. It makes this brave and funny. Although he is indeed the most likely to be able to stop a candidate who can withstand an attack by Bimeng. But the most likely thing for him is that there is only a little bit of hope that is almost invisible on the impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lizard man West did not show any excitement in his voice and movements, holding the steel sling silently and welcoming to the behemoth. Even the arrow that can be shot into the steel plate can't guarantee that the only two places that can pass through the skin of Bimeng are the eyes and the mouth. The eye that is shot in the movement and is not disproportionately small in the head is also good for the mouth that is covered by the tooth. It must be very close. Maybe it should be the same as Asa. As for whether he has such an opportunity and luck under Bi Meng's claws, it is difficult to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Algin’s growl is even bigger and wilder than Vere’s. He picked up the weapon that had been thrown to the ground and rushed over with the ogre. Even if he can't compare any damage and obstruction, he can't stand still. Even with his own teeth and claws, he must try to delay the monster according to Asa's orders. The order that Asa finally added just made his blood and fighting spirits completely boiling. He made up his mind to be able to fight for more opportunities for other companions, even if it was torn into pieces and trampled into the meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Luken’s actions are different from them. He suddenly turned and ran to the behemoth who was beating with Asa at the pace and hitting the cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sneaked into the huge footsteps of Bimeng and grabbed something on the ground. While picking up this thing, he could turn him into a muddy foot and step on his tail. He also heard a clear scream in the roar of Bimon. After Bi Meng’s foot fell, he did not mention that he was living there and set him there. He screamed and died, leaving his tail at the foot of Bimeng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the body of Bimen, he ran away and Luken opened his hands and picked up the things he picked. It was the only remaining arrogant bomb on Asa’s body that had just fallen from him because of the struggle of Bimeng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the unfolding of the scroll, a dazzling light ball appeared between Luken’s hands. No one can see the size of this ball of light. Other orcs in the run have to instinctively hold their eyes. It was almost a small sun that was pulled to the mortal world. All of them could only vaguely perceive that the dazzling light and shadow had been drawn in a straight line and then a burning heat wave swept through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the explosion is not earth-shattering. It’s just like the fire of a normal magician. The little noise of nothing is so disproportionate to the dazzling brilliance. Instead, the screaming of the behemoths shook the entire valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the glare of the light, Bi Meng also instinctively raised two claws to cover the eyes, so its head and face are only all hair black And the giant claws and the two palms that were in front of the disappearance disappeared, leaving only two half-black arms and a slag that was completely charred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably one of the reasons why this scroll can be saved. The power of the top attack magic of this fire system is not the explosion but the temperature. If it wasn't for the magician's own operation, the hot ball would be half-cooked by the person who used the scroll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mongolian beast waved only half of the black-eyed arm of the painful roar from the giant mouth. But only half a second is just a strange grunt. Lizard Man West did not miss this opportunity. He jumped into the air and lifted the steel smashing trigger. The poisonous arrow slammed into the mouth of Bimen and fell into the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not a fall. This arrow did not go straight into the brains of Bimon as Vist had imagined, and the effectiveness of the toxins was hard to wave out at such a monster. Bimon's broken arm like a huge charcoal was not only directly hit but was wiped, but the lizard in midair flew out like a straw and fell on the cliff. Then this half-dead Bimeng continued to move forward with the steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well and Alkin together slammed into the foot of Bimon. The loud noise slammed down and fell to the ground, but it immediately broke the arm and slammed out of the ogre and the werewolf immediately flew out. Then Meng Meng immediately climbed up to the fastest and rushed to his companion who seemed to have been unstable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly a thick and bloody smell suddenly filled the entire valley and then the overwhelming red even the midday sun in the sky also became a dazzling blood drop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa finally pulled the knife out of Bimen’s body. When the knife is pulled out, it is a large piece of blood. This time, not only the knife was pulled out, but also all the blood and essence in the body of this giant beast was also polished. Bimeng, who had been struggling for a long time, immediately fell silently in this moment and shrank like a leaky ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece of blood that condenses the vitality of the behemoths is not scattered, but as part of the knife, it condenses on the knife and covers the blood of the entire valley. And bloody smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa lifted the knife and lifted this huge blood color in a difficult way. Under this huge redness, his people are pale and small, like an inconspicuous one. Attachment. Even the behemoth that rushed in was as insignificant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood condenses into a huge knife in the shape of the knife. This color and smell greatly spurred the half-dead, and it screamed and seemed to squeeze out the remaining forces in life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa also screamed and succumbed. The bloody giant knife became a bright red light curtain filled with valleys as his movements. No matter what it is, Bian's bark or his own voice can't hear anything. The humming and breaking wind of the bright red light covered everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a huge red lightning hit the blood of this valley and the gravel burst into a hurricane sweeping across the ground and shaking the entire valley seems to be this The knife is two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody rain settled from the middle of the body of Bimen, which fell into two halves. The blood sprayed in the direction of the knife paved into a hard rock on the avenue. A trench with a length of more than one meter was formed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the knife, Asa also fell to the ground like Bi Meng, as if this knife also waved his own blood and life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that stood up was Luke, who was dark and burned by the heat, but it was a skin injury. He was only fainted by the temperature in front of him. past. Then the armor and the sturdy body of the Ogre's body did not cause him too much damage. Alkin also only broke the sensitive reaction and movement of one hand and several ribs werewolves. He resisted and fluctuated after the millennium, and did not be knocked into the meat by the charcoal giant arm. The lizards have more bones that are broken, but they are nothing under their amazing resilience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs looked at the ground and the two pieces of the corpse that had been dumped out of the body of the body were still bloody. The most important thing is that it is almost unimaginable that the man-made ditches have only a look of horror and admiration. In their impressions, it seems that even General Gru could not have such incredible power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noon wind almost stopped. Within the hour, the narrowest place in front of the valley mouth can pass smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
