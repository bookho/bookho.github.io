			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who am I remembering?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javi turned his head and looked at Inha M's face is still the kind of white paper. He frowned and thought about shaking his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Hamm sighed and asked: "Do you remember who you are?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Javi thought about it or shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then do you remember how to use this thing?" Because Hamm went not far from a swordsman's body and took out a sword throw. Gave him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javier caught his eyes and immediately got his light. His hand was also very stable and tight. This sword is like a key inlaid into a Just the right lock hole. He looked at the sword in his hand and thought about the sound of a sword hitting the front of the sword. There was a trace on the wall more than ten meters away from Jarvi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven't forgotten this, but how do you know how to use it?" Inham took a reel from his arms to Javey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javier took the reel and nodded. It seems that he has forgotten his previous experiences and the people he knows. He usually remembers the things and skills he usually uses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inham faintly said: "I know that you have a lot to say to me but it is not the time. You should use this transfer reel to go to Elazia. Already arranged everything to be there, someone will wait for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javi did not nod this time but was thinking about why he was thinking about why he believed stranger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if I don't say you should feel that I am helping you?" Inham smiled and looked at Javey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it’s just a mask-like smile. He has enough charisma and persuasiveness to express his affection and warmth in his eyes. Even an idiot can feel that this is his son. Javi looked at him and finally nodded slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden and loud noise came from the direction of the square. Because Hamm frowned and looked in that direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, then you go first. The things here seem to be coming soon. As long as they are solved, they will be much quieter." "Inham finished this sentence and turned and ran away in the direction of the square." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation on the square is supposed to be stable long ago and the sudden noise is not just a simple killing. It must be great. The accident was born. And as long as it is an accident. No matter what kind of accident, it is an opportunity for Inham. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oufu once completely failed in the eyes of Magnus's biggest instability is that he is very clear about this. Although Magnus may not be eager to deal with himself now, he is supported by Lancelot. It’s only a matter of time to return Adela’s body to the Pope’s position. And then he has to deal with himself naturally. So now, once you have the opportunity, you must not miss it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javier’s injury is already better. The truth of the Dark Star also understands how the two shadows that have been around him have to deal with Magnus. It is the only problem left. And as long as there is any awkward opportunity, Hamm has the absolute confidence to solve this problem perfectly. Therefore, even if his current mood can not help but also a little excited, all the attention is placed in the direction of the square in front of the square did not look back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is behind the scenes. Javi did not use the transfer reel but looked at his departure with a strange look. This look is completely different from the simple one just like that. It is a thing that contains too much and too deep something is definitely not a person who has lost his memory. Even when Inham had just turned and turned his back to him, his hand holding the sword even twitched a little, but after all, he still didn't move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression on his face completely changed after Hamm completely disappeared into the field of vision. For example, a person who was forced to do a few hundred years of sculpture finally has the freedom to finally release it. His face began to wave from the simple sorrow and then became excited and the incomparably excited and handsome facial features were distorted because all emotions were excited and rushed to the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silent laughter, he also looks at the direction of the square and is similar to Ham's eyes. The eyes that are looking for opportunities are only the ones that are more and more blazing like a wolf who has been hungry for thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the situation on the square can no longer be described as chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru's fall makes the battle's balance completely inclined to the Glorious Castle side. After losing the bodies of the orcs several times, the swordsmen priests finally achieved the advantage. The remaining beasts were semi-automatically forced to be suppressed in the center of the square. At this time, as long as two or three * divisions throw out a big mantra, the battle can be ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just one person completely subverts the situation that has stabilized. Even with the power of Gru, it is impossible to reverse the situation in this huge battlefield by one's own strength, but this person has done it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, no matter what the situation is, it is just like a huge mechanically composed of countless subtle joints, only the most critical position is identified. Take control of everything at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A huge black dragon has destroyed the palace of Elazia towards the direction of Celeste..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court swordsman from Erasia came out with such a sentence that everyone was shocked, but the performance of the two people who should have been the most stable, Lancelot and Adela, actually It is the most erratic and almost stunned. Others are simply stunned by the two of them but they know best what this black dragon means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mollier is out? How is this?" Adela was stunned. Only he knew that the current Glorious Castle could no longer have the strength to face an ancient dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello... can't you summon the guardian angel again?" Lancelot whispered to Adela. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No..." Adela shook his head and looked at the ring in his hand. His voice was weak and swaying. "The power of the king's ring has been exhausted. It will not be used for a few years to accumulate. Is it true that the shining castle is really..." He shook his head in confusion. "... Isn't that the seal of Akibad? How could it be at this time for no reason..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You make things clearer What is the Black Dragon?” Adela frowned and asked the swordsman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsman opened his mouth but only made some weak voices and then his head fell weakly. His injury did not seem to be under the treatment of the two great priests. The slightest improvement is getting heavier and heavier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Adela looked at the two great priests who supported the swordsman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know...somewhat strangely our healing magic seems to have no effect...the smell in his body is getting weaker and weaker." The two great priests were also helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" Adela quickly went up to the swordsman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty is coming back." Lancelot suddenly rushed straight to Adela's left hand and grabbed his back. The right hand was a sword facing the two priests. The hanged swordsman with the thorns stabbed. The Jianwai’s dazzling sword light passed directly over the distance of more than ten meters to the person’s head. And only a half-blinking slower than Lancelot, Adela's body is also a step forward, immediately became a retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that these two people are already late. The news about Black Dragon is so amazing that the blow to them is too big and the victory just hopes to rise. The big volts made the spirits of both of them slow. Earlier than the two of them, the slashing swordsman's hand suddenly fell into the waist of the two large priests who were holding him. The entire palm was completely immersed in the body of the two people as if they had caught two large groups of cotton. The two great priests didn't even notice that the expression had not changed. Then the swordsman's hands flew two big priests and flew out and ran into Lancelot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the great priest is not directly colliding like a thrown stone, but they are still swaying like a strange step. Like a snake, Adra rushed to Lancelot’s hand or punched or clawed out. Their faces were full of surprises and they didn’t understand how they would be inexplicably doing it. Such an action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot’s body paused and let him escape the two great priests. He had to avoid the two big gods who were thrown out. It was only after the skin of the body had been escaping from the black lanslot. The two men collided with each other with vivid and doubtful expressions on both faces. People are like two pockets of mud, with a strong rancid smell and the spirit of the dead spirits filled with the nose of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
