			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cusbert Great God official came to the Dukes House and today is at the invitation of the Duke. He feels more and more that he is really sorry to know this friend until now. Why haven’t such a person worthy of contact before? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sitting down in the living room, the Duke took out a dress and handed it to the big priest and said, "This robes are what I get occasionally. But It’s really useless to me. I think this kind of thing is the most suitable for Cousbert.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great God Officer took the clothes and saw it. A white, plain and light robes. He smiled slightly and the Duke always liked to give this cute little gift. However, the feeling of this robes in the hands is a little weird. He took a closer look at the delicate texture and the incomprehensible feeling. This robes were made from the best silk imported from the Far East. It is necessary to know that many aristocratic women in Wangdu are proud to be able to have a pair of such silk-made gloves. Such a large robe is even more precious. He couldn't help but hesitate to use the big, raised eyes to look at the Duke and say, "Duke of the Duke....this seems too expensive..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Precious? The Duke looked a little surprised. "I didn't spend a piece of copper and I didn't use it for me. It's worthless for me. And for a clean and honest clergy, if you care about what it costs, what is the value?" The value is probably too cheesy.” The Duke made a disappointing expression and even a little disdain to say: “This is just a piece of clothing.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp It is true that Cuthbert feels that his fuss is a bit superficial. I can't help but feel a little embarrassed but more happy. He slid the robes and looked at them more and more, imagining the appearance of wearing them. But he immediately felt that it was a bit wrong. Although the robes were not inlaid with any ornaments, they were very simple, but the tailored style... According to the dress code of the church, this is actually a robes that the cardinal can wear. Cuthbert looked at the Duke and said: "This is a robe that the bishops can wear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The Duke frowned. "Is it? I didn't look at it in the future. I don't know that this dress can only be worn by the bishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't accept this Something. You will still take back the gift to the Bishop of Ronis." The great priest was helpless and politely handed the clothes to the Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Duke shook his head again and again. "How can the things that have already been handed back be recovered? You can stay with Custerbert and wait until you are promoted to the bishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Cuthbert is a bitter smile. Bishop Ronis is still in the position. Even if the big man on the church does have a high opinion of his ability, he is still thinking about this position within ten years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I will never give this to Bishop Ronis." The Duke of Mulak looked cold and snorted. "I don't like him as a bishop. He is a little derelict."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" The eyes of the great priest were more surprised and looked at the duke adult. . Although he has always been somewhat dissatisfied with Bishop Ronis, he never dared to show it. The prestige and merits of Bishop Ronis are not only in the church, but in the empire and even in the whole world, there is absolutely no one to deny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哼. Although I admit the previous achievements and abilities of Bishop Ronis, his actions in recent years have increasingly lost the responsibility of a bishop. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s angrily look at the eyes of the great priest who felt that it was emitting a sense of justice. Can not help but nodded slightly: "Yes. As a highly respected bishop, he actually has a deep friendship with the humble little man like Hamm... and it is inexplicably to promote some new people is simply an indestructible dead wood bishop, but in front of It’s a treasure. Even the last time... I don’t want to talk anymore.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s adult also nodded: “It’s not clear when people are older. It’s inevitable that stubbornness is a bit more confusing. But he is also a bishop’s affair. It’s really an empire’s worries.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This...should not be ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The clerics you have such a high level of ignorance do not know much about politics and economics. The economics of the empire over the years have exceeded the income of the church." Are you getting more and more stretched? Do you know what the reason is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The Duke’s adult sighed in the sky and worried about the country and the people. "It’s all because the bishop’s adult always thinks about his annihilation of the Necromancer’s guild, and does not work hard to educate the people to make the people feel at ease under the embrace of God. So the mobs are raging and pagan...”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a sigh of emotion, the duke hated as if whispering to himself: "Sometimes I am really weird, the guilds of the dead, why don’t you send an assassin to take this The person who wants to deal with them solves it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ugly face of the great priest twitched and looked at the white robes lying quietly on the table. sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke did not look at the big priest but he never missed what he saw. What's more, his energy and time spent on this time is to find such an expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duke insisted that he take the bishop’s robes when he left: “I believe that you are the only one in the empire who is qualified to wear this dress. People. Even if you can't do it now, please be sure to take it as my wishes and beliefs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the Duke’s face is still not good after sending away the great priest stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the plan is proceeding step by step perfectly, the Duke’s mood is not a sign of improvement. Only he knows how to take risks this time. There are not so many risks associated with the countless strategic schemes that he planned in his life and then went hand-to-hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is no way because it is already imperative. Because it is not that you are dead or that I am dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duke looks at the magnificent roof of the Cathedral of the Magic Academy, no matter where you are in the capital. The glorious and holy majesty can be felt even if it is so far away. He shook his head and said to himself, "You forced me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two days later, a message came from the School of Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bishop of the bishop went to the big house where the corpse was stored in the west of the city and then let others wait outside to talk to the old man for a long time. The bishop came out It seems very angry in the future. According to the priests, it seems that I have never seen the bishop of the adult so angry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you know. Go back." The spy who waved this magic school turned and retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the daughter Xiaoyan has been reluctant to make things clear, but with the Duke’s mind, even the words and the things he heard that night are enough Something is going on. These are all in his expectation and expectation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who is angry and angry will have a gap. Now it is no doubt the best time to start. But this is not enough for the Duke to know that even the Cusbert priest and his own grasp are too small to find a helper. But where to find the right person? If there is nothing wrong with Clavis...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis was also brought back by the people who were sent by the Duke this morning. After returning to Ali with his entourage, he reported to the Duke that the master was in the middle of the road and went to the church with the gods. Later, when the Duke saw Asa, he knew that his deputy was more and more fierce. He sent someone to look for it and actually found it. Thanks to someone who happened to see the dying in the woods, he saw that he was an officer and a nobleman who had received a reward for his treatment. Even so, because of the serious injury and lying in the wilderness for a few days, even after pulling back, I have been living in a coma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Marquis of Elni asks to see an adult." At this time a descendant came in to report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I really don’t have the mood to deal with these trivial idlers, I still have to meet them. The duke waved angrily and said, "Call him to come to the study and find me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis in the study silently bowed his face. I have seen my son's half-dead life, even if this father who has never had a sense of responsibility will not be better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The young man is too impulsive." The duke also sighed and sighed. "I have found the best doctor of the king and the best pastor and therapist of the Magic Academy to be sure to save his life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marquis Still looking down and thinking as if thinking about something. When the Duke was preparing to be very polite and courteous, he suddenly looked up and asked: "Duke of the Duke. You know that I am often unable to take care of the children in Wangdu. So I want to ask you how to prepare him?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
