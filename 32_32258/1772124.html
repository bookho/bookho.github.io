			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa took the knife out of the bed. The top is full of dust. This weapon that unites the father's efforts and blessings to represent his dreams has been lying under the bed for a long time. Bishop Rooney told him not to wear this knife, which is not suitable for the identity of the priest, even in terms of styling. Because the knife is the standard lower-level soldiers and the hooligans' weapons are rudely chopped and killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knife that bears the familiar weight on the back rubs on the skin through the rough feel of the linen clothes on the body. The most common clothing equipment for adventurers, salt honey, and herbs, which are essential for survival in the wild, are also carefully held in your arms. The current state is just like the night he left in Karendo. The mood is completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time it was very simple excitement and excitement but now I don’t know what it is. It seems a bit frustrating as if it is a bit strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the inside of the hut, look around and see the hand of a dead man standing there curiously looking at his weird old man thinking about it later I will not come back. I feel a sense of reluctance in this strange place full of dead bodies and organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the front of Sandru and he sighed. Half hug and patted Shandru’s shoulder and said, “Goodbye to the old man. I will miss you when I have time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which knows Sandro But it seemed to be slammed like a rabbit with a knife. He took a picture of him and hugged him. He said, "What is this guy who is so disgusting? Is the head out of trouble?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, just leave and say hello to you." Asa took his hand back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where? Where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if I am hiding around Travel around the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you do with the things that Ronis has arranged for you?" Sandro looked at him with a squint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not do. I can't do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" When determined to be caught Go to Ved Nina?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled a bit: "Looking for death? I was almost killed by two Necromancers a few days ago. Listen to a call." What the master of Aiden said that all the necromancers except Widnina wanted to kill me. I really don't know how my lich classmates did it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aiden's guy..." Shandru groaned. "This group of bastards has already been... I don't know what Ved Nina will do... forget these things that haven't been with me for a long time. Let them toss with them." He sighed and looked at Asa. "Then you dare to go out and run around? Are you tired?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa said with both hands: "I don't want to continue in Bishop Ronis anyway. What do you do under the shit? I have what I want to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if you are wanted by the church all night, you don't care?" His black and white eyes are dead. "Is it hunted by the guild? Isn't it scared? In addition to Ronis, they are probably a bit too scrupled. Even an emperor is no different from a chicken in their eyes. If you want to kill, you will kill. You are such a sissy boy. Not afraid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Afraid. Who is not afraid of death?" Asa smiled and sighed faintly. "But I know better what I want to do and don't do anything. If you want to kill, come and kill. I don't know how easy it is to kill than an emperor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru Looking straight at him, his eyes continued to look like dead and dead. Suddenly nodded: "It’s not a sissy. I don’t know when it’s already a man.” He looked up and asked: "But are you not afraid that I will take your guy who wants to escape and give it to Ronis? You know that we are Friend's." He spread his hand in a big way. "And the person who is so loyal to me must be thinking a lot about my friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oops. I forgot." Asa suddenly woke up and took a shot. Frowning and looking at Shandru. "But you should not betray me if you are so loyal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru’s eyes said with a sigh of relief: "You guy is my next move." The corpse's coolie has a fart qualification and what loyalty I say?" He turned and walked into the back room and took out two things to throw it to Asa. "The money will not be given to the middle of the escaping work. But if you look at your work and work hard, there are two things that I have not used for you. Maybe it will make you live longer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a book about the magic of the dead spirit that I wrote down in my own years. I didn't think that I would like to show it to others. This guy is also honest to send you a commemoration."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this is a necromantic magic" Asa hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s good magic to keep your life." Shandru spit out. "Hey, you bastard, don't know, I am so kind, I am willing to send you a commemorative, you still pick and choose, you don't want to return me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to of course "Asa quickly took the book into his arms. It doesn't matter what magic can be useful is good magic. Under the influence of dark meditation, Necromancer now seems to be the only magic that he can cultivate. He still remembers very clearly how he was flying by the other side when he was with Master Eden, and the lightning thunderball hit him in the rain. In the future, if you still rely on the lowest level of rotten fireballs to carry a hundred world tree leaves, it is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked at the other piece of soft skin, and it was like a melting wax that was condensed into a group of distorted features. When the king was in the king, he avoided the mask used by the Duke. Since the Duke lifted his wanted, he forgot to throw it. Unexpectedly, Sandu closed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a good old man, you don't give it to me earlier." If the book of Necronomic Magic only surprises him, this thing It just made him ecstatic. Bringing this thing, as long as the old man of Sandu does not say that anyone other than the limited number of the bishop of the bishop, Mulak, can recognize himself. And I have always forgotten this most important thing. I think that it would be easy for Sandro to run away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't give these girls anything," said Sandru. It seems that I suddenly remembered what I had reached out to Asa. "Give me the guy who cut the wood on your back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa untied the knife and handed it to the old man in Sandro Looked at the thin, pale fingers on the knife and a bullet, a sound of gold and iron. "Well. Sure enough, it's a good thing to use all of Karundo concentrate. But it seems to be just a good blacksmith to build without any other processing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well is my father." Asa replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your father?" Sandro nodded and slammed the knife into the back room and slammed the sound of the box and took a small bottle and said to himself: "Today, this knife is such a good thing. There is a magic experiment. I always wanted to do it. You don't mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... "Asa is a little worried. "Don't break it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru did not scream, just use a knife to sweep the stone platform out of the open space and bite the finger with his own blood. On the stone platform, a small magical array was drawn and the knife was placed in the center. Then he unscrewed the vial and spewed out a magical wave of bloody smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sees the inside of the vial as if it were the fangs of two animals. "What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ear of a vampire count. This stuff can't come easily. Killing the monster kills my head." Sandron replied. Then he placed two teeth on the knife and covered it with one finger and began to whisper a low-pitched spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire magical array began to gleam. Asa can vaguely feel that the enormous magical power is condensing vibration in the magic array. But there is hardly a small space in the magical array. With the mourning of the Sandro mantra, the magical power in the semi-circular space of the three-footed square is getting stronger and stronger. The two teeth that Sandu's fingers are holding are actually slowly softening and melting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody smell of the teeth is filled with every space in the big house to completely cover up the odor that was originally occupied here. I don't know if it is an illusion that Asa can faintly hear a sharp and screaming call. This voice is also true and illusory, but makes his heart shake like it is directly echoing in people's minds and souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical power in the magical array is getting stronger and stronger. The little space seems to be squeezed into a rough sea. The two teeth of the vampire have completely melted into a white liquid that flows through the knife. Although it was actually inaudible, Asa felt that the name of the place that didn't know where it came from seemed to destroy the entire big house. He was scared to look at Sandro inexplicably, but now the old man who is always at the old age is full of cold sweats and whiskers and white faces are transparent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the screaming screams quickly weakened. The white liquid melted from the tooth on the knife body also penetrated into the blade like the water that met the sponge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get your hand." Sandro sighed. But Asa had not responded yet, and now his hand has somehow went to Sandro's hand. Sander’s finger, which had been holding his teeth, gently caught a small piece of meat in the center of the Asa index finger. A burst of painful heart came to this piece of meat has left him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The splattered blood fell on the knife and there was a banging sound like a drop on the red iron plate leaving a dark mark. The strange call also disappeared completely. The magic inside the magic array is also poured into the blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru a 踉跄 Asa quickly reached out and held him. He reached out and wiped his sweat and sighed: "It's really old..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a few breaths, Sandru pushes Asa’s hand and stands on his own Said to him: "You take the knife and look at it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knife seems to have changed nothing except the blood. However, when the knife enters Asa, it can feel that a strange magical force is flowing in the blade. It is probably because of the blood of his own. This magical fluctuation seems to maintain a strange rhythm with his breathing and heartbeat. . A knife that was originally plain and plain is now a magic weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic weapon he had only heard of before. The most advanced blacksmith needs to cooperate with the senior magician in the process of smelting to add precious magic materials to make the magic power permanently in the weapon. Some of the best magic weapons are even more valuable. And it was incredible that Sandru made a separate moment in this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The luck of your stinky boy is good. I just imagined this magic and I know that it was a success." Sandru looked at his work with weakness. nod. "Not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa holds the knife and feels the flow of magic inside and then looks at the book and face in the other hand with a strange impulse. Born in the chest. He looked at the listless Sandro and suddenly bowed to him: "Thank you... take care of me so much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Shandru’s spit I almost spit on his face. "Whoever cares for you, take care of you. Let's roll it and roll it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked at this weird old man and smiled and said: "If there is time in the future I will come back to see you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru re-examined him from top to bottom, nodded and shook his head. Said: "When I saw you, I thought I just picked a cheaper coolie... I know that I have so many things in the future... It’s hard to predict the world. But if it’s hard to predict, don’t even think about it. Your own business will do. You roll it... Oh, are you not going to say hello to Ronnie?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forget it. I will see this for free. Now," Asa smiled and shook his head. "And I heard that today there is a Bishop Adela from the Holy See who is probably busy with Bishop Ronis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adela Bishop "Shandle listened to the name and looked up and thought about it. "It seems that I heard who mentioned this name... strange feeling." But he finally did not think of anything but just bowed his head and said to Asa. "Well... don't come back if you are free after you leave. I always feel a bit strange...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What strange?" Asa asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing makes you go strange." Sander waved his hand. "If you want to roll, just roll it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get out of the big house and come to a hill on the hill outside Wangdu City to look back at the endless house. Although this place seems to be a nasty recollection for him, but I think I will never come back after I left, but I still have some reluctance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing to do... Asa sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night. The ducal palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young female financial assistant minister just reviewed the last batch of documents today and stood up and walked around. Since the beginning of the morning, she has been sitting at her desk and has been working for more than ten hours. All bureaucracies looking for the Empire will never have more dedicated and more dedicated officials than her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the convenience of office, because she is not very good as a daughter, she has to set up her office in the Duke's Mansion. Of course, there is also the meaning of the Duke of Mulak. In fact, his daughter in charge of the entire empire finance in his own home can naturally have extraordinary convenience and spiritually have to say that it is a huge enjoyment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach seems to be a bit sinister. However, Xiao Xiao’s work has indeed been done very well and is not biased. The most important thing is that with the current power and status of the Duke’s adult, he has no need to fear what people say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gossip is a terrible good reputation is necessary, but that’s only when competitors need to win the favor of others and the feeling of numb opponents. . When the momentum is already no longer, even if it is not only a hand to cover the sky, it can block more than half of the time, and then no need to spend extra thoughts to set up a memorial. Of course, the Duke is by no means the kind of savvy who is proud of the fact that he does not know that he can call the wind and rain. He is very well measured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my daughter actually has the opportunity to embark on a career path and demonstrate such a strong ability to be so motivated and politically ** this really makes the Duke happy. There is no son in the battle with the father and son, but having such a capable daughter is definitely enough to make people happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I often hear others praise that she is not a tiger father, a dogless girl, but she often secretly smiles. Perhaps all of them think that their father thinks so, but it is not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She does not have the slightest power to desire that she may not be the most capable and the most diligent and great official in the world but absolutely the most helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She does not seem to lack any status, has a status, has a husband, and has a loved one. But in fact she knew best that she had almost nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not the kind of person who is suitable for her life. The only meaning of the husband and family who had a false name from the beginning was to be bound and jealous. Although she also has a father, the Duke’s actions are enough to make any child chilling and even the slightest closeness can no longer rise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, she finally has a 'business'. She gave her life to save the many rewards behind the emperor. She only asked for a position for her to escape from the role of ‘women’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also did it. She has a clever mind. The adventures that have been around for many years have made her understand that the suffering of civilians can be fully immersed in the work and try to do everything possible on the handle. When you are too busy, you don’t have time to worry about it, and it’s much better to think about it. And when the results are achieved, looking back at those achievements seems to have a sense of satisfaction. She slowly found the center of her life and even had some goals and fighting spirit. She felt that the work in her hands might make thousands of people eat more and comfortably. This country can be better. Enrichment and sense of accomplishment are indeed satisfying<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that when the night dead has to stop working and rest, she still can’t help feeling lonely and unconscious. I will think: How is he doing now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little man walked over the terrace of the room and stared at the stars in the sky. I don't know why the night sky of this evening is particularly clear as the beautiful starry sky I saw with him on the wild land. Deeply sighed and remembered the days in Oufu. That carefree and happy time...but these have passed forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if I’m too tired to work. It seems that he heard his footsteps again. The burlap shoes rubbed on the ground, the unique rhythm slowly approached the nose and seemed to feel his sweaty body. He couldn’t help but close his eyes and fascinated by the illusion of the clouds. in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s rare for such a star to be in the king. But how can you see it when you close your eyes?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small slammed his eyes and turned. When I saw him, I stood by my side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is no longer wearing a white robes of the priests, but the same ordinary rags as before, a bit messy on the back of the head or carrying the oddly shaped knife . Just like the appearance of Oufu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was so surprised that she didn’t dare to move to confirm whether this was the illusion or truth that she missed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
