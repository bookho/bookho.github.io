			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purification of magic is like the effect of pouring water on other magic. Ai Meijia's slow and weak moments on the werewolf were washed away by the fluctuations of the white magic. But it is not able to drive away the magic that makes the werewolf frantic just to eliminate some of the effects. It was like using a bucket of water to fight a fire but it was not able to extinguish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no other reason to say that this fire is too big. If the old man of Relas is a bucket of water, the energy of the fire is converted into water, at least it is a river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of businessmen and mercenaries are all in the mid-air young people. They first saw the young man’s shot and was amazed. This skillful skill and magic may have been the standard of the Templars of Celeste. The old man of Relas’s voice, who was in the air with his body, immediately stunned his eyes and saw that his body seemed to have a multicolored light shining. Then the cool and graceful posture in the air is like a piece of wood. The body still keeps the sword flying and the expression is not changed, but the eyes are still moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three wolves screamed and screamed and pulled everyone back into fear and panic. The white light that the old man of Relas has added to the werewolf has disappeared. The howling of the werewolf is more wild than it was just as if you are tearing your throat with all your strength. A werewolf even bite off a piece of meat and half a tongue in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the name of the Lord, purify the bondage of evil." The old man of Relais pointed to Abin, who fell to the ground. Purification was cleaned up and the magic effect on his body was removed. Abin jumped from the ground and turned up, and the werewolf's meteor hammer rubbed him from his side and pulled out a big hole in his original position. He quickly ran back to the old man of Relais in a swift action that was no less than just. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just saved a grandson’s life, but the old man of Relais did not feel relieved. He only felt that his mouth was mixed with bitterness even in his mouth. I wonder if I am dreaming. Purification can work this way because the object of purification is also the magic of white magic to control Abin, which is a high-level white magic paralysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can also reluctantly use this advanced spell just by praying and mourning the prayer. The magician hidden in the darkness is silent without any sound. What does this mean? The archbishop of Elazia personally came to rob this caravan? Or is Celestor serving the Pope's great priest? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably a magic scroll. Perhaps it is possible for a red archbishop to be hot and violate the ban. It is also possible to transcribe a paralysis to others.... I barely found a reason for the old man of Relas to pray and pray to heaven: "In the name of the Lord...." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The multicolored magical light flashed abruptly in the body of Rela’s old man. He immediately kept the squatting prayer position and couldn’t move and even his tongue was stiff. The prayers that mourned half of it could not continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the werewolf screamed again, Ai Mei did not need to remind the weak and slow surgery to immediately reattach to the werewolf and she immediately licked The mercenaries in front of them were forced to prepare a frozen spell when they barely dragged the werewolf. But immediately, paralysis also fell on her head without warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give me holy shelter in the name of the Lord to block the enemy." Just as the old man of Relas was stiff, Abin knew that there was no such battle. Any room for struggle. But he did not immediately turn around and ran, but first gave himself a top level of protection magic that he could use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic shield illuminates the Abin on the body, which pulls up the sister and grandfather who have become as rigid as the puppet and turns to run towards the horse. But I only ran two steps and it felt like the same thing. Everywhere, the feeling of going all over the body disappeared. He only watched as he kept running and took his grandfather and sister to the puppet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic shield that even resists a chain of lightning does not play any role. There is only one reason why the caster's understanding of white magic has become more conventional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man in Relas’s mind is full of chaos. He does not know how to understand everything in this life. The angle of his fall can still see the situation on the spot. The werewolf and the mercenaries are still fighting the mercenaries and no one is running away. They don't know what the magic of the previous ones meant or even the power of the magic. The performance of the three grandfathers and grandchildren surprised them. The action of the werewolf was slowed up and then the white wolf was immediately settled. When Abin was flying in, but he was recruited by the old man of Relais, he must use magic together. It is inevitable that three magicians will help victory in the back. The mercenaries struggled to delay the werewolves and hoped to give the three men enough time to use more powerful magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the light of the three white magic lights up on the three slow and weak werewolves. This radiance is so bright and sacred in the dark, you can tell how the white magic contained in it is rich and profound. Even vaguely sacred songs rang in the magical glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenaries are shouting with joy and screaming. This momentum is even more magnificent. You know that a higher level of magic must be able to level the three werewolves in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cheers of the mercenaries, the eyes of the three werewolves did not settle for it, but because the action was too fast to become three fuzzy light groups. Almost all the mercenaries kept their enthusiasm and voice, and they were caught in a smashing wreck of the sky. Only the last one had to make the cheers a half scream and then slammed. The screams and the whole head were broken in the mouth of the werewolf like a crisp apple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘天之佑’. The old man of Relas recognized the spell with the last point of resolution. It is definitely the highest level of magic that only the archbishops can use. And if this kind of magic is carried out on the werewolf, the effect is enough for any werewolf to tear a big image with bare hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three werewolves even changed their body slightly under this amazing magical effect. They won't know that they are the orcs who have enjoyed this top-level auxiliary magic for the first time in history. They only feel that the sudden power is bigger, the movement is more agile, the energy is more abundant, the bloodthirsty is more wanting to kill. With the holy white light and the bloody blood of the wolf, the wolves rushed to the merchant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone fled." The merchants screamed and jumped on the horse and ran in several directions. However, when the werewolves were more swift than the cheetahs, most of the merchants had just been turned over and the horses were torn apart. Only two businessmen fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werewolf did not catch up. It's not that they can't catch up. In the eyes of the current werewolves, it seems that the horse's footsteps and the tortoises are not much worse. They just stopped standing and walked back to the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness of the darkness, a blue glow glows. It was not until this time that the magician behind the scenes revealed his position and traces. He has done it and he can safely leave. As for the rest of the aftermath, these three mad wolves will turn all the living things left here into pieces of minced meat including themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hair of the wolf people has been soaked in blood and stuck together, gasping and even the green eyes are also boiling bloody taste like three A evil spirit that only emerges from the blood pool of hell. They looked around and searched for any living life in a camp full of corpses. One of the two werewolves rushed to the horses and Kodo beggars there, and one of them looked at the three stiff people there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it seems that the three that are on the ground are not exactly the same as the body, the werewolf can still feel that it is alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Live. There are also pulses and hot blood and squirming internal organs. Can be used to tear and smash and can hear screams. The last thought of the werewolf's remnants was completely annihilated. At the beginning, the bloodthirsty and violent ** was only in the heart of the heart to dominate them to kill and bite. But now, with the soaking of blood and internal organs, as more and more of the body tears between the claws and the teeth, the madness has expanded to the point where the consciousness spreads directly into the body. This body is now only for the purpose of tearing the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big step went to the three stiff bodies. Probably a little can't wait for the werewolf to bite off one of his own hands and vigorously chewed his hand bones and teeth in the mouth and crushed the creepy sound of each other. The original face like a dog has completely changed because of the twist of the muscles. It is not like a living blood and saliva dripping down the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Meimei’s eyes are still wide-eyed, still condensed, ready to be magic, the focus at that time, but the tears have been falling down her face. . She couldn't scream and couldn't tremble, let alone avoid the only monsters who could watch the nightmare as they approached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the Abbe's lying can't see the werewolf. He can only see the hysterical despair and fear in his sister's eyes. He can hear the footsteps close at a glance. . He only felt that his blood was burning and his brain was suffering, but he couldn't even blink his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old people of Relais could not see the approach of the werewolf. But he could see Ai Mei's tears streaming and seeing Abin's eyes frantically congesting. A heartbreaking pain came from the waist. He could feel the huge claws of the werewolf smashing the internal organs through his abdomen, and even the spine was pinched off and grabbed the remaining body to lift him up. Although his body is stiff, but it is enough for the pain of the soul to tear, he still feels clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
