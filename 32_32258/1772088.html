			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town hall of Bracada has now been converted to the command post of General Sanders. The general is now squatting in one of the cabins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a bloody and rotten stench in the house. Hundreds of flies swollen in the narrow space. There are three fleshy bodies in the center of the house. The blood on the corpse has condensed into black. The exposed muscles have shrunk and the black blood stains are twisted together. Some places can see that the internal organs of the viscera that are dry under the plateau air look like the skeleton of the leather skeleton. table. Only the head of a corpse is intact and can clearly see the dying expression, but the body is no longer shaped. There are flies that are being widened by him and swelled by the black bloody mouth and drilled in the nostrils. The other half of the face has been squashed and the eyeball is still dragged to the side of the eye. It is like a dehydrated grape. There is no body damage, but only the lower half or the lower part of the mouth is neatly placed. Cut it off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the news about the city of Oufu has been learned almost from the various channels so far, but there is still no detailed information about the orc troops. How do they form what kind of troops? What kind of weapon is used? What is the fighting power? These are not clear. And the horrible monster that seems to disappear in the wilderness will not be destroyed by the beasts. The general never believed this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten days ago there was a trace of the presence of a small group of orcs in the wasteland. So I immediately ordered a team of 100 elite soldiers to catch a few prisoners and came back to torture. But when the soldiers went to the sea, they all went to the sea like no news. A few days ago, they sent people to find the result and only dragged the three. Come back with a corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inexplicable corpses are making the generals very angry and irritated this morning. The message of the loss of hundreds of magicians is in the morning. In the case of death without a card, he has already moved to his head and has already been negotiating for a change in the court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general anger almost wants to kill the soldiers and return to the king to kill the El Nih family of politicians. But these are undoubtedly impossible. He is a courtier who can't defy the king's life. The existence of the Paladin is to prevent this kind of thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, soldiers came in and reported to the new priest sent by the School of Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not received any military notices. This is no doubt that these are the politicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take the bastard to me and cut it. No." The general screamed out in anger, but immediately remembered that it was not his men’s rules. I have to go out to meet myself, but this kind of gift is naturally unexecutable. He snorted: "Call him to come see me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the hall of the town hall, the general saw the new priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the new priest?" The general wanted to directly use the lion-like voice and eyes to scare the young man in front of him. "How come you didn't see you with your entourage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because there is no stipulation that you must bring a follower." The new priest did not react to the majesty of the general. Take something out of your arms. "This is the appointment instrument of the School of Magic and the documentary of the document."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general’s sharp eyes were carefully scanned by the young man. Not the same as he expected. This young man is full of dusty faces without the scholastic manners of the clergy and no military rules and a strong but self-confident expression and some breath hidden under the dress of the priests, but the generals vaguely Some strange feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the general who had already planned it still decided to give him a horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sacred officials have been studying in the School of Magic for so many years of knowledge and knowledge." General asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s another embroidered pillow for the scorpion. Looking at the sorcerer's face, the expression of the general's eyes jumped and he even felt that his canine teeth were sharper than usual, just like a bite, you can kill this waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general cold waved and waved and said: "Please come with me, I want to ask you some questions." The general led the priest to the room where the corpse was placed. Pointing at the bodies said. "This is the soldier killed by the orcs. But so far we have never seen how the orc soldiers are fighting. How do I ask the priests to use your extensive knowledge to find out for us from these bodies?" The clues come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the priest changed and looked at the three bodies and frowned very hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general smiled smugly as he waited to see the new priest vomiting or urinary incontinence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this sigh sighed and began to look closely and even flipped the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ribs of this corpse are completely pressed inside and there are still very serious dents. This is a huge claw that seems to be a biped. Flying Dragon, did you send the soldiers into the lizard swamp?" The new priest asked faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general was stunned. The corpse is that he has been unable to tell which weapon he died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No." Unknowingly, the momentum of the general has been reduced by more than half. "This is a force sent ten days ago. According to the horses, the reconnaissance troops with a small orc on the wasteland were sent back. So I sent troops to catch them here. It is still far from the lizard swamp and there will be no bipedal dragons." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is the two-legged dragons that the orcs themselves have bred," said the official. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is impossible to have no one to domesticate this monster, let alone an orc." The general thought that this kid was completely nonsense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lizard can steal eggs from the swamps and grow up like a domesticated hound. They have the ability to build a city and have the ability to do this. "The tone of the official is definitely as good as what he saw with his own eyes." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds very reasonable. The general had nothing to say and he had to listen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new priest continued to look at the corpse as if the butcher looked at the pork and continued to say that the general was stunned: "This was killed by the werewolf. From The wounds of the corpse are all hit by a very heavy weapon. It should be a meteor hammer or a mace. You see there are traces of spurs and drags. Since it is only the orc’s reconnaissance force, it should be There won't be a big and bulky guy like an ogre. So the weapon can be used by the werewolf. There are no other scars on this body. It’s just that the head is cut off neatly. It should be a lizard. They have such agility. And strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general listened to all the arrogance has been completely replaced by horror. Even he himself can only see what damage caused by the weapon is completely unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since they have a convenient scouting tool with a two-legged dragon, it is easy to observe from the sky where it is necessary to send a reconnaissance unit. This small group of orcs It should be the attitude of coming to test our army. And our army took the initiative to attack them. Naturally, they did not want to be caught by us. Only the counterattack was made. The combat power of the fully equipped orcs is not something that ordinary soldiers can compete with." The body was moved to the general and said faintly. "You shouldn't rush to send troops."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general took a while to react. Nod and said with a deflated voice: "Well, please ask the priest to deal with your own affairs. I will handle it on the military." After being discouraged and shackled, he was replaced by some respects and nodded. "Thank you for your guidance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa walked out of the city hall and sighed and tried to blow out the scent that melted into the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original vibrant streets of Bracada are still full of people but they are all soldiers with guns and guns. The creative hotels are all full of weapons and food. The whole city is filled with the meaning of Xiao Xiao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Bishop of Ronis, the life of the person on the street may be in his own hands, as long as he thinks of this, he feels tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunset dyed the clouds reddish like the nose still seemed to circulate the smell of the body. This bloody sunset looks extraordinarily ominous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An owl stopped at the tree next to him and stared at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why is he here?" Vadina looked at the image in the crystal ball with surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the sergeant that Ronis sent to go there. I wonder why he has inexplicably found out who he was from." "A Necromancer looks at the crystal ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
