If you want to send Ai Meimei’s sister to Erasia, it’s better to go to love first. Sterner's three delivery reels came faster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The whispering singer just got enough well water, so I have enough time, now I I started to do business...” Asa sat behind her side, looking at her snowy slender neck and the side profile of the knife, and suddenly it felt strange. After a moment of stunned, he suddenly remembered and asked, "Yes, don't you ask me what is the strange smell? I thought you would ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Talis faintly said: 'If you are willing to say it, you can say it. If you don't say that I have been following you, I know that your journey is also for this thing. I will know someday and I will understand. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled and silenced for a while and said: "In fact, telling you something is fine, I am taking this thing out to find one." Human. And this person should go there to find me without any clues..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Find someone? Then you should go to the thieves and adventurers union to reward. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is useless to reward this person. I found the two corps of the thieves union and the adventurer union in the King of Einfast, and the clues were vague. I am ready to find a needle in a haystack. So I went to the whispering forest to get enough sun well water. Really not, just go to the Far East to find a way..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Far East? Talis snorted and muttered, "I will go too." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the face of His Majesty the Pope in Celeste finally loomed a rare boundary. From the last dawn, I felt the breath, the Pope. The face doesn't seem to be much better, then slowly and slowly getting worse, until now. At least Adela has never seen this old man have such a face. Although he did not show any anger or have any Excited traces, but the wrinkled brow and the cold lingering lingering around him all indicate that his mood is already terrible.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Go and call me Lancelot. His Majesty the Pope suddenly said to Adela.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adela quickly quit and quit. In the presence of the current Pope, he did not even dare to speak out, that cold The taste even made him feel that his scalp was tightening in a burst.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paladin was quickly led by the Cardinal. The Pope did not even have When he stood up, he asked directly: "Lancelot, I ask you. How big is your grasp of the Tamik Knight? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not sure. "Lancelot's answer is simple and very certain. "I may be able to beat him, but I can't kill him." "Defeating a person and killing a person is totally different. Especially for those who are used to acting secretly like the Knights of Tamik.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well..." The pope nodded. He thought about it and asked. "So what about the guy named Gru?" Or can he and Cydrus join forces to kill the Tamek Knight? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still no. Lancelot still shook his head with certainty. "First of all, Tamik will never go to this person." I know that his judgment is always accurate. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope couldn’t help but nod. He knows that Lancelot is doing a good job. The best of the Tamik Knight is not his skill, but It is his sturdy nerves and purely rational judgments. Such a person will always know what kind of opponent he should face. What kind of countermeasures should be taken under what kind of environment, such as the most sophisticated machinery. From a certain point of view, Lancelot can't compare with him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that in order to reaffirm the fact that he is not willing to affirm, he asks again: "also Just said that no one on this continent can kill him? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question Lancelot thought about it before answering: "I don't know... I can only say that as far as I know, probably should This is the case. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope sighed for a long time, and some nodded in a moment, slowly said: "But I am sure that he is dead now... ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pope did not speak, just stood up and walked to the window and stared at the scenery outside the window. After a long while, he said slowly: "In fact, I am very reluctant to calculate what to arrange. Because I know that no matter how accurate it is, it is impossible to do everything under control, and there will be accidents. I have always believed that as long as I can grasp the direction in general, it is only important that this time is important, and I will only be able to play with these people to watch these eyes carefully..." He turned back and smiled A moment, "But I don't know if this is my bad luck. This time I actually encountered such a big accident, Tamik Knight..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Please feel relieved," Adela said quickly. Only he knows best what the death of the Tamik Knight means to His Majesty the Pope. If he chooses to lose one hand or lose the Knight of Tamik, he will never choose the latter. And maybe he is willing to both hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course I have to be relieved, not to be reassured..." The Pope sighed heavily. It seems that the decision is the same, and his face is not suddenly clear. But the gloomy color has disappeared. "Since the eyesight has failed, then there is only a big move..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope said to Adela: "You go Erasia called Inham back to me, and I have something to discuss with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Adela quit. He is truly convinced. The most important cronies, the best use of the men, such a huge loss just made the Pope a little depressed, he almost immediately can withdraw from the pain of this loss, like the next person to make the next step The intention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be able to sit on the top of the continent. It's not just because of luck or anything else. I don't know how he would shut down if I died. The cardinal suddenly thought of this and couldn't help but shudder. Because he knows that he will never have an important Tamik Knight for the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hamdale Village, a small, inconspicuous place in the Calound Basin surrounded by clouds all year round. This small village was originally unrecognized, not to mention other places, even in the self-closing Karendo Basin, there are not too many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a year ago, this little place was famous. The son of the blacksmith who ran out from here did not know how to become the murderer of the empire of the Red Emperor Ronis and the Duke of Mulak, and became the most vicious wanted man in the history of the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to do this, the king also sent a Knights’ investigation to the village, and made a small mountain village jump and jump, almost to the entire village. Together as a wanted criminal. However, in the end, it was inexplicably lost. It seems that I did not investigate any famous names. I just heard that the same officer did not know how to be thrown or the stone became a serious injury. The young knight who led the leader was carried out of Karendo. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the incident of the wanted crime, there have been constant adventurers and bounty hunters coming here to investigate the detailed background of the five thousand gold coins, just after After this year, the people have gradually come less, and I heard that there are signs of canceling the overnight rewards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all this has not changed much for this small village. The small place where the bird is not pulling suddenly pops up such an earth-shattering big man, as if the rain on the roadside suddenly gave birth to a fire-breathing dragon. This kind of thing has already exceeded the scope of villagers' understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably where is wrong, there are many people who look like. This is almost a common understanding of all the villagers. Out of the boring peculiarity of the residents of the Karendo Basin, they are reluctant to let their main thinking go beyond the habit of living. In addition to accepting the silver coins thrown by the adventurer bounty hunters, they maintain a normal and normal attitude towards this matter. In the past year, the villages have been improved, except for the rewards that have been asked to improve the lives of the villagers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three people coming out of the village today. It looks like a young man with a risk, a man and two women. However, the three did not panic into the village, but stopped at the grave outside the village. The villagers did not express too much curiosity. There are many such people, as long as they ran to plan graves. There have been adventurers who have tried this kind of behavior in order to find clues, but the dwarves who are coming to hear the enthusiasm for this kind of behavior, and have learned the people who are disrespectful to the dead and the earth. I have never had this kind of behavior in the future, and Karendo has never dared to fight against the dwarf. The soil around the tomb was enriched by the dwarves. The tombstone is still the same, with the name roughly written on it. A very ordinary grave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
