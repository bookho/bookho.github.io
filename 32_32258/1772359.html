			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To us is to kill him. Only kill him to extract the leaves of the world tree and the power of the sun well in his body to destroy the sword of the Dark Star Handle." Talis took a deep breath and finally began to nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Twenty years ago, under the leadership of Pope Deken, the strongest of the Big 6, the power of the church has reached its peak. Deken’s Majesty It is the strongest of the Big 6, whether it is power or personal strength. So he began to challenge the legendary mythical black star.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explored countless elves After the study of the ancient books, he discovered that the ritual intention of the elves was to fuse the power of the world tree leaves and the sun well into one person and let the person feed the sword."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power of the world's tree leaves and the sun well is the only force that can make a difference to the Dark Star. Although it can't destroy the Dark Star, it can damage the Dark Star. Although it's impossible. Saving the Big 6 from cleaning can at least pass this ritual to delay the Judgment Day, which is enough to destroy the Big 6, until the next time someone pulls up the sword. Although he knows Deken’s majesty, he does not believe it. Instead, he believes in Akibad’s Predicting that you are bringing together all the power to change the world The strongman of the world. So he wants to pull up the Dark Star to challenge this legendary destruction artifact with his own strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we want It is not to destroy the hilt itself but to release the dark atmosphere when the black star is destroyed. According to the elves' classics, when the black star is damaged, it will spread from the sword and the scent of dark death. Compared with the ultimate curse contained in the sword, it is enough to kill thousands of people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The breath is our ace to deal with Oufu It is the most effective means. It may be the only means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oufu’s exhibition has already been expected by the Pope’s Ma Tauren and the Hawks. The most important thing about the banshee returning to their strength is that they still seem to be mining a lot of magical gems in the Sandefes Mountains. They are all necessary materials for making high-end scrolls. Sedros means the sky. If you let him make Out of a lot of advanced magic scrolls It will rise several grades. Even if it is because of the annihilation of the main force of Nigan, it can be a tough battle to concentrate all the strengths of West 6 to deal with Oufu."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only take the hilt of the Dark Star to the wild and destroy it. The death of the scent is not only the best means of destroying the Oufu in the whole wilderness of Oufulian. Otherwise, even We will eventually win the battle with Oufu and there will be tens of thousands of soldiers who will sacrifice on the wild land. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And Oufu is the tortoise city that must be destroyed as soon as possible. The potential of the exhibition is too fast. So far, Sedros also controls the behavior of the orcs, but when he does not need to worry about us, in order to compete for more resources and territories, Oufu will sooner or later rub against us. Even people of different faiths will have struggles and contradictions. What's more, between different races. When it becomes a true great empire, it will be the entire human race. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That's it, so he must die." For the future of the Big 6 is at least to prevent tens of thousands of soldiers from dying in battle with the orcs and to destroy the hilt of the Dark Star, which may be more dangerous. So he must die. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay. Now I have told you that this is what you want to know. "Talis is already tired and full of her face. It is more tiring in her sense than in the battlefield to smash the top ten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;" Know these. What can I do? He has to die. Talis looked at Ai Mei. "I know that you like him, but this is the fact that no one can change." So I don't want to tell you that maybe it might make you think that it's just my reason and hate me maybe it's better. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down at the underground Ai Mei was silent for a long while before saying: "Why should all the responsibilities be pushed to the body of Asa? This is not his fault. Sister, you should know that he is a good person. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not his fault. He also has no responsibility. I... I also know that he is actually not a bad person. It’s just...” Talis deeply sighed. In fact, Ai Mei had just asked Lancelot about this sentence. “Just... we only have to do this. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is not his responsibility to let an innocent good person bear the responsibility. Is this the justice that your sister has always said?" Ai Mei looked up and looked at Talis's tender face. It was all stubborn.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them stopped talking and watched each other silently. After a long time, Ai Mei suddenly said: "No matter how I must find a way to save Asa, I must not let him die... I will not let you die."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't say stupid things. You should go to rest first. I will let you leave tomorrow." Talis shook her head. This is just a child's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the evening, Ai Meimei disappeared from the military camp. No one is now how she got out of the military camp. It seems that she has been in the tent and has not been removed. The only explanation is that she has a transfer reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although strange Ai Mei has a transfer reel, Talis is a little relieved. What she is most worried about is what awkward things will be done when Ayimei knows about it. Now it seems that she will not carry the delivery reel with her. This at least shows that she should have already planned. As for what it is, Talis has no energy and no way to pay attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been no power to change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Cardinal of the Cathedral of St. Peter in Erasia was in the room of Bishop Hamm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s true that like Alice’s thoughts, Ayimei had planned before she asked her, but this plan was definitely not what she could think of. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two bishops have heard about you." Ai Mei looked at the two cardinals. Take a small piece of metal from behind your ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very precise air magic array and space magic array on which the metal piece can feel the vibration of the air and then another piece in another place A corresponding vibration is generated on the metal sheet to transmit the sound intact. This magic trick requires the carrier to drive it by yourself. If you are facing an object like the Pope or Lancelot, it is naturally impossible to hide it. However, it is no problem to deal with Talis who is not guarded by God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really unexpected to hear it clearly. Thank you for your hard work." Bishop Adela smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot, though, used Amy's in a very secret way. But it is not difficult for them to find her, especially she seems to want to find Talis. The agreement with this little girl was also exceptionally smooth and expected to borrow the fact that she really asked about it from Talis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't thank this, this is also the question I want to ask. Instead, I want to thank you if you don't help me, I don't know where to find the answer. A person can't even go there." Ai Mei bowed to the two cardinals and asked faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now what I want to know is how the two plan to deal with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Oh? Interesting little girl." Bishop Adela smiled and looked at the Bishop Inham next to him. "What. Do you think we will dispose of you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I know that too many people continue to live, it will definitely make the two adults feel small." Safety. And the two bishops are not kind, Lancelot. There is naturally no reason to let me go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Then you dare to come back? Adela looked at the smile on Ai Meimei's face and it was still so gentle and bright. It seemed like a very cute and cute animal in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two bishops really want to kill me. Am I still hiding? Since you can rest assured that let me go to see my sister, I am naturally prepared and not afraid of me. I am not afraid that I will run away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although you are in Erasia, I know that I can’t escape the eyes of both of them.” Ai Mei Very calm. It is a veteran that is not commensurate with her age and appearance. Excessive hardships have already given her the mind and mind of this age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good little clever girl." Adelaide nodded and smiled even more charmingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature that really puts on this little girl is more than just a small piece of metal that spreads the sound and there are always a few eagle eyes watching her. . He sighed a little and reluctantly. "It’s really hard to have such insights and guts when you are so young. Even I feel a little bit unbearable..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
