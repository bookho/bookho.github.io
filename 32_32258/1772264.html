			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Meimei sat on the fly and smugly looked around the classmates. She tried to pull the Pegasus's reins and wanted to learn the actions of the two elf riders. Let the Pegasus fly. However, the Pegasus just slammed the nose and started the wing fan twice. That's how the magic apprentices around are amazed. This kind of animal that only lived with the Elf was originally in Dongda 6 and could not see it. It was even more amazing when they learned that they were from the legendary mysterious whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are mostly male apprentices beside Ai Yimei and more female magic apprentices next to them are surrounded by Abin, especially looking at him with a leather armor. There are a few swords with a long sword that are clamoring for an internship and need a swordsman companion. Abin in this group of girls seems to be like a duck from time to time to make them laugh and ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two brothers and sisters just felt the huge space magical fluctuations in the forest when they passed by the whispering forest yesterday, but they curiously entered the forest but were almost some of them. The dead wood guards stepped on the meat. Fortunately, Luya took people out to see if they recognized their brothers and sisters. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the Elf family’s migration to the whispering of the sorcerer Luya, according to the instructions of Elder Lloyd, did not mention to anyone, of course, their two brothers and sisters Will know. However, since they met Luya in the whisper of the whisper, they simply sent two Pegasus knights who had just sent them from Tula to send them back to the Tower of Teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whispering of the forest has never been known. Sunwell and the leaves of the world tree unite the power of the gods to let the ordinary people subconsciously dare not approach. Only the elves themselves and a handful of top magicians know the sacred place of the ancient elves from the classics. But now the world's tree leaves only have a fascinating power for mortals. Before the relocation of the elves, the relocation of the elves will sooner or later be perceived as being inconspicuous and intimately related to the forces around them. This is the embarrassment of Elder Lloyd to Luya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Lloyd went directly to the king of Einfast to discuss the details of the whispering of the Mori and the empire, so Lucia gave the two elf Pegasus Knights At the same time, the task of giving people is also to let them say hello to the Tower of the Tooth. Meet the 6 famous magical holy places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, in the heart of Luya, the biggest problem has been solved since the transmission has been completed. The Elf family has completely separated from Celeste's sphere of influence. And once the ancient trees of war re-grow on the sun well. The two original enchantments that are in the same vein resonate with each other and even influence the three world tree leaves in the sun well. In addition, the combat power of the empire tens of thousands of people and countless dead wood guards do not have to fear even more powerful opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this special situation that seems to have everything in place, it is quite normal to send people to visit the Magician Guild. At least in the effort to learn how to get along with humans, Luya does not feel that there is anything wrong with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the two brothers and sisters of Abin are even less likely to feel that something is wrong. The two of them quickly arrived at the Tower of the Tooth in the Elves. The two Pegasus knights were invited by the two tower owners to go to the tower and the two brothers and sisters stayed in the college under the tower. "Ai Mei, are you still studying at the Water Tower this time?" asked a girl who had a good relationship with Ai Mei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Granden Tower Lord said last time. If I come back, I will go to the tower of the earth. He has a relationship with the Lord Aidenta. I have neglected my duties before. Even if it happened." Ai Mei smiled and spit out his tongue and pointed at Abin. "This time my brother will also learn from the Tower of the Tooth. I tell you that my brother's swordsmanship is very powerful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow the legendary magic weapon Double repair... so handsome." Several girls heard it and called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you know the elves? I was so envious of you when they were sent by Pegasus. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This will not tell you. secret. Ai Yimei originally wanted to say that she thought about it and shut up again. But it seems that she felt that she couldn’t help but say it and still said in a mysterious tone: "But you can tell me what is my secret." A lot and it’s all important and interesting. Say it must scare you guys. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ai Mei. Don't talk nonsense. Abin turned her head and looked at her. Her voice was not big but it was a bit majestic. Continued and said a few girls with a grimace. "My sister just likes to say something to scare people. I am sorry." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
