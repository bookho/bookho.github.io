			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tatalia is located on the northwestern edge of the wilderness. This country is the only part of the country where the only land on the 6th and the wild land is in the highlands. It stays in the highlands and then takes the slope from the east to the west and descends from the high plains to the western plains. The last point of the extension of the Sandefis Mountains to the west explored the country's vast mountains and swamps. It seems that most of the places that are contaminated with the Highlands and Mount Sandef are barren and absurd. It is in stark contrast to the prosperity and prosperity of the Great Plains of Elazia in the south. Only after the establishment of the pure commercial distribution center of Oufu was the country had a little economic improvement because of its recent departure from Oufu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erassia and other countries with a long history of culture and culture have always had little interest in the region. However, after several long struggles and gatherings, several indigenous tribes scattered here have evolved from the tribal alliance to a kingdom of Taitalia that is not the same as other cultures. There is also a lizard tribe in the kingdom. This is also the only country on the 6th of the European Union that recognizes sub-human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of King Tetaglia has continued through XI. A year ago, the old king, Talos, died suddenly after he had not had time to leave his life. Although the old king has always worked hard to make the next generation, he does not know whether it is God or man. Because there are only two sons among the 58 generations. So the two princes began to compete for the succession of the throne with the support of the five major tribes. After more than half a year of fighting, the great prince Brown finally won the victory of the three major tribes and became the eleventh king of Tatalia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eldest son of the Queen of the Room is naturally grown up in a pet and looks like a tall, eight-foot-tall mighty thief than a ugly little prince. Ze also asked the king's favor. Therefore, he used to take himself as the owner of the future Taitalia, and he was naturally obsessed with the sound of dogs. One of his eccentric hobbies is the hobby of feeding swamp lizards. One of the biggest pleasures is said to be watching how his cute pets slowly swallow slave girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason for the victory of Grand Prince Brown in the political struggle is simply that the four words are mediocre and incompetent. This is the assertion that Sedros had read after collecting the information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three tribes that support him are indeed stronger than the two tribes who support the little prince but are truly decisive. The shadow of Taitalia, the great sage Nimbas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Culture and magic are as primitive as the land here. Tatulia can maintain self-esteem and status in front of other countries because of the possession of Nimbas Magical magician. Legend has it that he once used an enemy three to deal with three regular high-level magicians and used three magics to defeat the three magicians who were good at the three series. He also once made a church cardinal sit on the magic. In the downwind of Zhonggan, he used a terrifying magic to kill a rebellious tribe. The rest of the remnants of the thousands of people will lose their morale and collapse. In Tataglia he is almost synonymous with the god of magic in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many years ago, the old king fell into a desperate situation in an accidental accident of going out hunting. Thanks to the sage passing by in time to save the party and save the danger. The king’s prestige for the shadow sage has long been admired for a long time, and when he was saved, he invited Nimbas to become the national division of Tatalia. It is a pity that the sage's character is eccentric and simple, and he likes to go out to politics, and so on. At the request of the old king, he ordered his only disciple, Roth, to be the court magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why this savage sage has expressed appreciation and concern for the great prince. His disciple, Roth, was also a court magician and he also met with the great prince. In the struggle for the throne, there was Rosko's advice and the influence of the shadow sage. The Brown Prince could easily defeat his brother almost without blood. Immediately after the throne, the court magician was sealed as a prime minister. In today's Tatiya shadow sage Nimbas is almost equal to the gods in people's minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the recent great sage is also a bit strange. He hasn’t shown much in the past. He’s been in the past few months. It’s not even that his disciple’s prime minister, Roske, doesn’t know where he’s going. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grou strode on the red carpet and walked down to look at the information on the hand. This information was sent to him in the first time after he arrived in Tatalia. The densely packed small letters on the parchment describe the current situation of Tatlaria and all the important figures and their positional characteristics as much as possible. Among them, the description of the shadow sage, who has never shown any political aspect or even faceless, accounts for a considerable part. It is obvious that the person who wrote this material attaches importance to the sage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talent. Gru's mouth picked up a rare smile. Then the proof of this talent folded in his hands and gently turned into a wool-like slender debris that scattered on the carpet with his pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four guards and the commanders in front of the main hall looked at him nervously. The commander smiled awkwardly at him and asked for a briefing. But Gruen didn't even look at him. He glanced at the thick door with his hands and immediately separated him from the sides. He walked in and walked in without going to the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ou Ford makes General Gru to meet the King of the Kings~~~~" The voice of the commander was rushed out and did not have the slightest solemnity to be like a vegetable farmer. Grab the price of the guests who are leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall is broad and profound. Although the style that Brown King liked was still manifested because it had not been refined and repaired. The conference table was placed at the end of the main hall. His Majesty the King and the patriarchs of the four tribes were already seated to wait for the guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The ping-pong' must have four soldiers to be able to push open the door and slammed into the wall on both sides under the push of this person. The loud noise of the ear echoed in the hall. But the footsteps of this person who didn't seem to be big were not clearly covered by this sound and still passed to everyone's ears. The rhythm of every step of the foot is equally heavy. It seems that this person has stepped on every step of the heart with every thousand troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small but empty hall in the distance that seems to have been filled with him alone. The footsteps that were stepped on by the look of his walking posture were filled with this integrated momentum. Everyone has a feeling of breathlessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sage teacher hasn't returned yet?" King Brown unconsciously turned his head away and didn't want to see the person and looked at the next Ros. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The teacher’s whereabouts have been erratic and probably go out again." The court magician and the prime minister replied slowly. "Let's rest assured. As long as you know the situation of the big 6 now, the teacher will surely guess that the kingdom's variables will definitely come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The teacher can now It’s good to come back.” Brown’s fat face was a little blessed. He didn't know why he suddenly had this idea. Although he is the head of the king of Tetaglia in the name of the king, the one who is the shadow sage in his heart is the one who can give him a sense of security is his master. Even so, with his disciples calling a teacher, he felt that he was honored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this guy like when the teacher is here? King Brown said in his heart that he was too disappointing and did not notice that the pets staying at his feet had always been ordered by the two swamp lizards that had slipped away when the man entered the hall. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew went to the conference table and did not speak. He only scanned everyone in the room with the eyes without any expression. The dark scorpions are like two black holes that have no end in the end. All the people who are seen are crushed by the illusion that they can be sucked in at any time. There is no such thing as anyone who cares about his actions to face the king of a country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ross can cough up. He was a bit strange. It’s just that everyone is just waiting for this person to come to the meeting. I don’t know why this person’s heart has completely shaken everyone’s mind as if he has become the master of this place. The guest is waiting for him to come to the teacher to ask for sin. The king did not speak at all. He only coughed two times to break the atmosphere and said: "General Gru. His Majesty and the four tribes are already here. Now you have come to ask the important thing that Oufu said. What is the matter?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king finally returned to the world and nodded and said, “Oh yes. General Gru, please sit down. Letter from the city of Sedros The words are very earnest and anxious to say that there is a very urgent matter related to the survival of Tatalia that will allow the widows and the tribes to discuss with General Gru. What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru did not answer directly but looked at the Brown King and asked coldly: "Where is the patriarch of Prince Taize and the Lizard Terran?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown King replied: "Oh, I have let them lead the troops to the northeastern border."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, let them go What are you sitting on?" Gru's pair of scorpions fell on the eyes of King Brown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
