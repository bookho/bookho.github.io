			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The midday sun is shining. Just as the big eared ones are looking forward to the desire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the strong sunshine, it seems that the ground of the entire hill has a golden taste. When the big-eared geeks saw yesterday’s big heads coming to their cottages, they all cheered as if they were celebrating a grand festival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a mighty leader standing with his hands on his back. Although he didn't sleep at all all night, his current spirit was full of overflowing from his eyes to the yellow light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has always been excited about his great achievements. All of their income in the past ten years has accumulated about a dozen gold coins, but only a little while yesterday, he has gained thousands of times of wealth with his sharp diplomatic skills. His achievements are enough to make any great man in history feel ashamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was thinking about the wealth he was about to get there last night. What is 10,000 gold coins? There is really no concept. One gold coin is equal to one hundred silver coins. One hundred silver coins are equal to one hundred copper coins. One gold coin is 10,000 copper coins. But what is 10,000? A copper coin is about 30 or more 10,000 or more than 300! More than three hundred feet can fill this cottage, but I have to add nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine and thirty more to the sea that is completely a money. Even if you roll your eyes with your eyes closed, you won't worry about falling down and getting there. You can eat beef every day for many years. Some beer is better.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But good The elephant did not see any horses carrying the same money as the ocean. The collar is a bit strange. "Do you want money?" When the two people just approached him, they immediately went up and couldn't wait to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Too much we can't take it." This answer immediately met the imagination of the mountain of money in the mind and immediately believed. The man who came here yesterday looked around. "What about people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s still there, it’s not hurting you." The collar was in a hurry. "Then you should take some to see first. Others you can't take us can move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the person still in the original place? "This person seems to care about this. Leading anxiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That would be great." This person seems to be a little unexpected surprise. The voice turned and took another person to walk straight in the direction of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait for us to take the money first." But the two men not only did not mean the same, but accelerated their pace. Until they approached the hole, they only shouted something wrong: "Catch them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big ear screams around this are only two people The past. However, just after a huge explosion, three or four big ear monsters were blown up and the other ones were followed by a large piece. All the big ear monsters were scared by this and immediately stopped their feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's just a magician. Don't be afraid of everyone on the brothers." The battle experience is rich. The magician who knows the close combat is just the object of the sickle. The short knife between them waved and rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rushed directly to the man who had just released a handful of magic. This is the big head that promised a huge ransom yesterday, and now his behavior is very clear that the promise of exciting himself all night is just a scam. Disappointment led to the high-expansion of self-esteem that fell to the abyss and he decided to kill the guy first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading rushed out and screamed at the man. But he immediately felt the hand in front of a tight eye. The body suddenly flew up and had no reaction before it hit the mountain wall. The body was almost completely scattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party has only two people. The big-eared geeks were not afraid of taking out weapons with their weapons and rushing forward. Some of them ran back to their homes to get weapons and rushed to the top with bare hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big eared ones are unsuspecting. Asa is expected to reach the topography. He also knows that as long as he holds the hole, he will have nothing to do with the fighting power of the big ear and the fighting power of both of them. The gap did not surprise him, but he did not expect his reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the real life and death. He has no soft hand. It’s just a few knives that have been soaked in the blood of the big-eared monsters. The killing in the battle is completely different from the fight. The flying weapons are slashing in all directions and the enemy is constantly approaching you. I don’t have to think about the movements and tricks. I can only use the fighting instinct to dodge and then cut the knife toward each body that is close to me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body and the back have been hit by the big ear monsters several times. If it is not this robes, he has already been hurt. However, Asa still did not care too much about the clarity of the meditation. In this case, the body was born out of this body, which made the extravagant blood more intensive. He was completely immersed in the excitement of animalism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly there was a completely different touch from the savage impact of the weapon. There was still temperature. "Go away from the hole." A shout screamed at him behind him, and he was shocked by the state of chaos and now his situation. Rodhart had already rushed to the hole but saw him rushing into the big ear group and rushing in with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assad settled his hand and tried his best to throw it out. After a loud bang, several big ear monsters were blown out and flew out to blow up the encirclement. The two men rushed out of the gap and ran to the cave where Klis was held, facing the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criss heard the commotion outside and ran to the wooden fence and saw that the two men were bloody and ran to the hole and scared back. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa didn’t take care of her and looked at the big ear monster that was slowly coming up. The big-eared monsters have already fallen more than 30. Now they are also very scrupulous about these two people and dare to slowly form a circle before more than ten steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?" Rodhart gasped a little. He was hurt a few times. He just rushed into the encirclement. It was a very risky move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa licked his mouth. He originally intended to be guarded by Rod Hart in order to prevent the big-eared monsters from catching Klis as a hostage. The second is not to be afraid of siege at the hole. Then, with this robes on his body, he rushed into the middle of the big ear scream to slash and put a few magics on it. This would kill the big squad's fighting spirit and then easily solve it. But now that Rodhart’s injury is not too light, he must rethink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what do you think? Asa’s brains turned quickly and couldn’t think of any effective way. Instead, there are several big ear monsters who have taken out their bows from their grass houses and look like they are going to take them as targets in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly a hoof came and a team of people appeared in the doorway of the cottage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This team directly rushed to the big-eared monsters. Immediately all the cavalry armed with a spear chopper rushed from a distance and rushed here. The big ear screams were immediately cut down and overturned. Other big ear owls saw this kind of battle and they began to flee. It is. Asa saw that he was a great man of Bolugan. He did not bring weapons and armor. He was riding on a high head and was even short, but he commanded the cavalry to make a left-handed strike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals of Bolugan only commanded the cavalry to drive away the big-eared monsters and did not catch up. Then he rode on the horse and looked at Asa and said, "How can you inform me about the special envoy? It is too risky for two people to come in like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be an adventure." Asa nodded and admitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, I heard that you almost smashed the pub in the city yesterday and thought about finding a helper. You will probably do it today. The city's escorts waited for a while to watch the people here and watched you come over and I drove them over. Sure enough, everything was in my expectation. Miss Duke is still okay?" Shaking his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa turned and cut off the lock on the wooden fence. Chris ran out from inside. Seeing that the situation around me has been completely controlled, she suddenly looked around and saw the big eared monster lying on the side rushing past and kicking and stepping on and kicking and saying: "Do you dare to catch me? Also shut me down. Do you know who I am for so long?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a child's farce and no one cares. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly the big ear screamed and stood up and grabbed Chris and grabbed her knife against her neck. This is beyond everyone's expectations that Asa and Rod Hart are far apart and completely out of reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All don't move me!" Hearing this screaming, the big-eared geeks who had already escaped from the crowd seemed to have taken advantage and slowly ran back a few more daring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all human beings here are only looking at each other and don’t know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chris’s neck was hung up and shouted. Her originally sleek face was completely horrified, and the green, full-bodied arm below made her look like a canary waiting to be dissected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is going to cut down the guy’s head to me?" Pointing at Asa’s arrogant, his ugly face was completely angered like a Like papaya that has been soaked in the gutter for a long time. "I sent his head back to the Duke to tell these humans that we can't despise and deceive. Then ask him to give 20,000 gold coins to us or send him his daughter's head."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big ear snorted and slammed the knife toward Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt just stepped forward and immediately shouted: "Don't move." The knife touched the yellow serration on Chris's neck. The knife was immediately trapped in her flesh. Just use a little more force and you can immediately puncture the layer of fine white skin. Rodhart immediately settled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big eared monster went to Asa and raised the knife in his hand. Asa had no reaction at all. He kept frowning and staring at the collar of Klis. What was in his eyes was not a messy look that was as disappointing as everyone else, but another strange and single taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt shouted: "Stop.". His face has been distorted. He just took a half step forward and saw that Asa, who was still motionless, suddenly reached out and pressed it on the face of the big ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. A huge spark of mixed blood and blood bursts. The bloody smell in the air was intense in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘When 啷’ the knife fell on the ground, the two broken hands of the big ear were still on the top and the lower half flew out and the internal organs fell to the ground. The upper body was blown away by the flesh and blood that had been blown up all over the sky. The big ear worms stuck to the companion's flesh and blood screamed like a pig and ran away. The other people present were completely stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s eyes didn’t squint and stared at the word one word and slowly spit out: “Now is our advantage here. You can't speak for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flesh and blood of the big ear whistle is now slowly scattered from the air and a solitary eye falls to the top of the collar. Also dragging some meridians. I looked at Asana’s eyes and stared at my face and looked at the eye under my feet. The body began to shake. The knife in his hand shook and Klis began to shake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s voice was as cold as a bayonet that had been frozen for decades. "I will let you guess again. If you hurt the hostage in your hand, what will I do to deal with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the collar began to shake. Just shouting: "You don't move, don't move"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I give you two ways." Asa still stares at the collar and doesn't care. Not slow to say. "You choose it yourself. You can kill the people in your hands and we will take you to cut all the meat on your body. I will ensure that you can take more than one hundred knives and you can see for yourself." See how your internal organs are pulled out and then suffocate." Asa's fingers pointed at the internal organs and blood on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two people put it out and I will give you a living path." Asa’s eyes seemed to be two red-hot knives straight into the collar’s ​​eyes. Piercing into the heart and smashing the inside is full of flesh and blood, and the sound of the collapse of the teeth will ruin all his residual fighting spirit. "You choose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collar suddenly dropped the knife and ran to the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criss fell softly and saw the eyeball and internal organs next to the ground and jumped up and ran to the nearest Rodhart The next side was planted on his chest and cried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed and shook his head. The Bolugan on horseback also sighed with a sigh of relief and shook his head and said: "Mr. Special Envoy, you are inevitably too risky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I Guess the Duke’s adult probably won’t get 20,000 gold coins. I can’t let him see my head and see his daughter’s head again.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is I don't want to be beheaded. Asa secretly said. He was not acting just now, although he also wanted to have a courage to kill Klis, but if he couldn’t, he would never change his head to Klis’s head. What Sander taught him, he remembered very clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
