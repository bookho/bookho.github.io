			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Listen to you here to confuse the public." Aden's master is beginning to shake the body's electric light is also constantly flashing. He only felt that several blood vessels in his head were on the verge of the explosion. "Don't worry about her, this woman must have been bought by the elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like everyone to be here? Those so-called witnesses are Sitting on the air element is coming here to get our Pegasus to go one step ahead. When they come, everyone knows who is fascinating." The voice of the female mage is not only loud but persuasive. Among them, the power of the power has been stabilized and stabilized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aiden’s master resisted himself from exploding a series of lightning that had been running in his palm and full of his anger. He knew that he would not shoot at this time. Effective otherwise, he would turn this woman into a coke even if he was thoroughly suspected by other magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loud noise and the fire came from below. The following magicians finally couldn’t support it. The summoned elemental giants were all defeated under the attack of the dead wood guards. Now only the attacking magic is everywhere to stop the dead wood guards. But this method is never sustainable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone else doesn't move the Air Master to save them with me." Adelley said loudly that he saw Master Eden. "If you dare to attack me, it is you who admit that you have ghosts. You don't have to be polite to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flying Pegasus with the huge blue water The curtain fluttered toward the bottom. A few air magic masters hesitated and had to follow them. Even if they didn't want to believe that Master Aiden really caused all these sins, they couldn't help but rescue their companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Calling people to save Luya’s elders seems to be on the other side of the road." Several elder elders in the war tree are in a hurry Ants on the hot pot. The ancient tree of war has been hit hard. Thoroughly unable to use the exact location of the leaves of the world tree. The position of Luya's drop is quite far away. It is difficult to determine the orientation by visual inspection. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key is that the group of siege magicians who are not far from the ancient tree of war is playing fiercely. The magical cracks of the elements of the magicians are deafening and the chaos of several elders is completely submerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Adelive’s muscles on the face of Master Aiden’s face, twitching a red eye and watching the back of the female mage seem to want to use this vision in her There are two holes in the body. But this time he didn't seem too angry but turned and rushed down. Instead of rushing to the trapped mage below, they rushed in the other direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other magicians, the departure of Master Eden is a little unexpected, but no one can move. This ambiguity seems to keep up with not stopping him. No. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it was just stopped by Aideley, his attention has always been with the two people below. He has always clearly seen where the person who just caught the elf is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very angry now, but he really can’t really want to rush to bite the stinky woman’s flesh piece by piece. He wanted to do this long ago and now he wants to panic. But no matter how the fire. He still has the rational reason to know that the current situation also knows what to do now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First he is clearly. The situation he is in now can be said to be very bad. He did not expect that this stinky woman would actually come out at this festival. Aideli’s people in the Tower of Tooth are not low. This is a plan with a lot of flaws. The original magicians had some doubts about this. She intervened in other magicians and naturally believed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they have been fighting for a long time with the elves, they have had no small deaths and injuries, but they have not reached the point where they are not dead. These magicians are not the kind of people who kill and fight. After Adelie had to rescue the magicians on the ground, it was even more impossible to continue fighting. And if she said that the real tower of the tooth has been sent here, then everything is complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But fortunately these are the most important things that are secondary to the world tree leaf. This is the root cause of his planning this action. As long as he has the leaf of the world tree, he can do nothing. And Adeley has to save the trapped wizards. This is the opportunity. Maybe it's just the last chance. Therefore, he did not rush to the two people running directly below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
