The Duke had the Duke In fact, he also has his own plans. He once said to me that the person he most grateful for in his life is me, that I brought him from those illusions to the realization, so that he has the opportunity to realize his dreams. But I I was thinking all the time, whether I helped him or hurt him...so even if he betrayed me, I am not too angry...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the campfire, Talis and Ayi Mei listened quietly to Asa’s story. Listening to the life of others is a wonderful thing, especially in such a turbulent life, although it seems to have nothing to do with yourself, but the most basic resonance of the same person can make the listener feel the joy and sorrow, the dignity of life. And helpless. And because of the spectator's reasons, it is better to see the helplessness and sorrow. Asa spoke in great detail, and this was his own hair. Many of Rodhart’s experiences were his own experiences, and the story continued until late at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good poor man." Ai Meimei sighed for a long time, summing up Rhode Hart's life with such words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talisi snorted and said, "What's so poor? He ended up in a smashing end. Wang Ding's end. This is a breach of faith. Guy, climb higher, stronger, and finally must fail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a question of success failure...." Ai Meimei flashed With big eyes, the bonfire maps the softness and tolerance of water. "He is not strong at all. He is only being succumbed and fleeing. His ideals, his dreams are crushed by reality, he is burdened with so many pains and regrets. He can only escape into reality. The reality is so powerful. So horrible, he only has to integrate into reality and become a strong man in reality. He is actually not pursuing his ideals. He is escaping from the past and making up for the gaps and shadows in his heart. He is not pursuing his own initiative, he is at large, so he is at large. He can ignore everything, his eyes have no other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to escape the shadow, it is a machine for the pursuit of power, love, friendship Even he himself has lost. Such a person is really pitiful and has nothing. No matter how high he climbs, he gets more and more, but he has never really satisfied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorrowful little female magician reached out and stroked the long hair hanging down the horns. She still has no feminine charm, but this pure and sensual is immersed in secular women. someLight and pure as water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of person..... actually accounts for the majority. Living in this world, how can you not surrender to the world? They never feel pitiful." Asa smiled, and the fat duke, who liked to smile, appeared in his mind. He recalled a conversation with the Duke of the Duke before his wedding. Follow Ai Mei's words. Rhodehart is exactly the same as the Duke, and he has only taken one step and left the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no natural generation of traitors, just as the animals themselves are not good or bad, Asa has always thought so. This is why he has never been able to produce complete hostility and killing for anyone. Even against the Duke of Mulak, Rhodehart, and even the Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you actually compare me to that kind of person? Where can I be like him? Even my own beliefs can’t be persisted, how can I follow my idiots? Than?" Talis said with Asa. Listening to the story of the middle of the night is one thing, but accepting the master who does not accept the story is just another matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am now.....just a little confused."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I can feel a little bit of his mood. Although it is a little different, but suddenly lost the support and support of the pillars of my heart, the confusion and horror, sad, really terrible." Ai Meimei hugs his legs. Like a frozen kitten, the slim body is even thinner and pitiful under the wide mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assa moved closer to Ai Meimei, but Talis jumped over and sat next to Ai Meimei, holding her back. I took a look at Asa: "Do you want to do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister is relieved, I will be your pillar in the future. Protecting you is also the only thing I can do. Be sure not to lose justice and light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked at the two people together, Asa also smiled. He walked back to the bonfire and sat down, feeling the kind of warmth that was rarely seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can continue this way, or go further. Asa suddenly had this idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling and thoughts only have land when I first went to Oufu. And her. When I thought of it, his heart suddenly became sour and sour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, but what did you say about the kid now? I remember that Empress’s queen helped him to plead, and exiled him. "Oh?" Talis suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa lay down and looked at the stars above. Answer: "I don't know. I hope he can learn some lesson. It's good to go where you can settle down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just hope. Asa sighed in secret, knowing that he would not be a man who was settled down. Indeed, as Ai Mei said, the eyes are only far ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The echo of this sentence still seems to resound in his mind, but now it sounds like a joke. Funny jokes that can't be laughed at all and can't be laughed at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really useful..." The old man in front of him murmured and nodded, violently coughing. Array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as the old man is there, such a cough will not stop. Sometimes Rodhart really suspects that the old man will cough up his lungs at any time, or directly cough up his own. He has hoped so many times in these days, such prayers. However, this old man is obviously dying at any time and will die immediately, but he seems to be able to cough to the next century. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighs, the old man opened the flesh on Rhodesart’s chest, the dry fingers picked and the ribs bounced like an automatic spring door opened. The three hands like the dry branches pinched the heart of Rod Hart, felt the unique elasticity of the muscle fibers of the young people, and poked his liver and spleen, which took back his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the feeling that the heart was pinched, and Rhode Hart knows it now, but his heart has not beaten yet, even the liver and spleen Things like the stomach have already been processed, and I don’t know what is stuffed inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels good all over the body, as sensitive as he has just taken a hot bath, his heart even feels the folds on the finger, even that The air spurt of the old man feels in his internal organs, but even the eyelids can't be licked, not to mention the sound. The vocal cords have been taken out and thrown aside. Maybe the old man thinks this organ he has used forever. Nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be very useful. This is his belief in him. Because he knows that only useful people will be reused by people, and will have the opportunity to climb continuously. So he has always tried his best to make himself useful. Not only exercise your body and martial arts, but also the mind, the intelligence you know, and so on. But he never thought that he was just such a usage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man pulled the muscles of his arms and thighs again. He seemed to be carefully looking at the blood vessels and nerves in his muscles. He couldn’t help but cough with a cough. A burst of sigh: "Good physical fitness, although the strength and physical aspects are somewhat worse than that, but the potential and coordination are much more, rare and rare... useful and useful..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s fingers are clear across the body, and the pain can make people feel that the mind seems to split under this sharp and huge tingling. But he can't use a little bit of action to ease and vent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one in the old man’s mouth is a kind of person standing in the corner. Probably can be regarded as a kind of similar, Rhodesart saw with his own eyes that the big muscles of the whole body were split into small pieces by the old man, like a toy piled up in huge blocks, and then piece together. This is probably the only person in the world who can experience the same problems as himself. If that is really a human being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to say regret or something like it. His current feelings are painful except for pain, and he can no longer accommodate any other thoughts and feelings in his mind. The blood flow in the blood vessels is no longer blood. The old man used a slender pipe to pour a liquid with a strange smell into his body. The rancid smell and strange magic power completely replaced the blood from the blood vessels. Dissipated to the limbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
