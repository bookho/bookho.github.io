			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa thought about it and said to Jessica: "You stay here and I will go alone."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Jessica frowned at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too dangerous." Asa replied faintly. He knows very well how high Jessica's sneak stalking technique is. The black elf itself is a genius in this area, so he will let her go to explore the road. But even she is almost now able to explain how alert and insightful several guards are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, alertness and combat effectiveness are always two different things. Even if there are two or three Templars in the guards, there is confidence in dealing with them. But his current purpose is not to deal with these guards but the cardinal who is in the middle of the room. As long as those guards are assassinated, they will turn into a frontal battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same assassination and combat effectiveness are two different things. Asa’s dare to assassinate Eszal did not mean that he had the confidence to defeat him in a positive battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the Cardinal on the parchment that the Bolugans gave him was the biggest and most eye-catching. The description next to the name is far from the description of others. There are only a few small words that "do it". Although only these words have already made the most important point of this person clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if this is the most important goal, it is not a goal that must be removed. Because it is too dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is actually the name of the cardinal on the parchment, but it is also the rigorous style of the work of the Bolugan adults. In the case of a threatened person, he is ranked first in order. Whether it was Bolugan or Cedrus, there was no requirement or expectation that Asa could kill Astur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as twenty years ago, Escher was in line with Ronis and today’s Pope Magnus and called the Big Six White Sorcerer. . Although he is the youngest and weakest of the three, it does not mean anything. Like a weak lion, it is a lion, not a rabbit. In his early years of fighting and adventure, he has experienced countless battles. The nerve reaction and magic skills are not comparable to Adela's lack of practical experience. Moreover, there is absolutely no escort guardian who is not a master of the cardinal of Elazia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More critically, if he is still a member of Deya Valley, then the hidden identity behind this is absolutely accompanied by unspeakable strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Asa himself did not think about killing this biggest goal at the beginning. After the assassination of yesterday, Asa and Jessica stayed in Wangcheng. Tulaula is in the southwest of Erasia and Oufu is in the northeast. Asa is here waiting for the Hilton and on the other hand, they can always pay attention to the movements of the Erasia. Once there is anything, they can react immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But staying here is a big problem. It’s the wind and the two strangers who will definitely attract attention. The Knights of the Kingdom are searching for suspicious characters in the city. St. Peter’s Cathedral is just one of the places where the Knights of the Kingdom will not search. So Asa sneaked into the air. The cathedral lurked in one of the most hidden places. Although the priests and the guards of the guards are not as good as the guards of the kingdom, but the cathedral is too big and too complicated, let alone two people who are good at concealing themselves, even two cows. I can find a place to put it in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after hiding here, a thought in Asa’s mind is born, since you can hide here, can you just kill that target? Maybe It was his last and last chance in Erasia. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the three people who were assassinated before are only the ones who attacked Oufu’s fingers, then Astell is at least a complete arm. According to the observation of the great people of Bolugan as the Oufu messenger, the relationship between Queen Catherine and the church is not intimate or even fascinating. If the Cardinal of Erasia died at this critical time, Queen Catherine might take the opportunity. Weaken the church's power in Erasia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although from this point of view, if the biggest beneficiary of Escher is to die, it will be Queen Catherine, but now the interests of Oufu and Catherine Queen It is indeed hanging together. Politics is such a seemingly ridiculous thing that does not necessarily have the common sense that ordinary people can't usually see through it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since coming out of the forest in Tula, he has felt something in the depths of his soul has been touched. He is not very able to tell whether this is because he has witnessed Gru and his earth-shattering after the war, or the awe of the two, or whether they are fighting with Lancelot or the elder elders telling them that The remarks. Whether it is the unparalleled pressure or motivation, it really makes him feel that something in his heart has re-invigorated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the motivation to have goals and fighting spirit. As he had just left Caloundo, he felt that his chest was full of life and strength. He saw the mountains but did not stand up but the heart had more power and saw himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when faced with a goal of great value and great danger, he decided to go and try it almost immediately. . This is certainly a very dangerous task, but it is also a step to let yourself move to a higher place. An experiment. And this sudden storm is no doubt a godsend. So he decided that he had to go anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do I want to stay here? Are you afraid of me to die? I said I don't need you to care." Jessica looked coldly at Ah. Sa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed and said, "I just don't expect you to die. Let's say this is not Tulalon. If it is really dangerous, I will probably I won't be distracted to save you." He knows that if he just sneaked away from Jessica, he wouldn't drag his hind legs but it would be another matter if he fought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The best thing is that I will follow you or send me to death. It is my business."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "That's just for you." A thunder banged in the ear and the window shook slightly. Asa’s reconciliation Jessica got up and gently pushed the small window on the roof. The wind immediately rushed in. The smell of the rain and the thunder of thunder and lightning filled the small attic mezzanine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forest of Tula, he saved Jessica from Gru, she did not express gratitude to Asa for saving her. With a bit of hostility and sneer, he looked at him and said, "Do you think that you will be grateful to you and then be your loyal slave forever? This kind of noble and great appearance is the trick of buying people's hearts. Don't you feel sick?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stunned. Although he did not think that Jessica would be as grateful as a character in the Cavalier novel, he did not think that it would be such a reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know now that there is never a concept of goodness in the world of the Black Elves. The good people are done in white." Gru looked at Asa and smiled. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed and didn’t know whether he said to Gru or to Jessica: "I never do good things, just do what I have to do." ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru finally let go of Jessica for Asa’s words as he said, but he finally lost the sentence "Nothing to tell others about me." ". Jessica later found out that Asa told him in a very weird manner that she planned to follow him as before: "But don't think that I am grateful to you, but I want to see if you are What kind of idea is what kind of person is playing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa naturally said that he agreed that he was in need of help, although the Black Elf was still Hilton, like them, maintains their position as a helper for Asa, but there are not a few different places like now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa slid out of the open window like a muddy piece of water and stuck it on the outside wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outer wall of the cathedral's stone is uneven, but at least even a monkey can't climb on it. Asa dare not use any magic such as feathers, and any magical fluctuations within a hundred meters of the white magician of this class will cause him to perceive. He uses meditation to control his first muscles to the extreme parts of the body. They are attached to the bumps on the wall and can even be attached to the gecko. He slowly moved down to the position of the room of the Bishop of Ascher. He is already very clear and below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a big hole in the sky suddenly, and the rain and water that had accumulated in the sky for a thousand years were thrown into the rain. It feels like a little fist in the body. Less than three seconds from the inside of the Asa wind, it was completely soaked. The wind and mad tearing the drenched clothes and skin several times almost drove him off the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
