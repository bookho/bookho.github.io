			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The midnight brutal highlands have few drizzles that bring a gentle taste to this originally desolate and awesome place. The raindrops sprinkled on the exuberant grease torches with a subtle hum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of sentinels watched the dark nights with great vigilance. It’s impossible to see how far the bright torches shine in this totally untouched field. They also understand that there are more than a dozen werewolves and lizards lurking in the invisible darkness nearby. But no matter how they reminded the spirit of the tired and anxious face, they could not hide that they had been close to two or three and had not rested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a food force unit that is sending large quantities of grain from the territory of Elazia to the army of the former coalition forces. But they did not expect that they would encounter a small orc attack in such a place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the command of the coalition forces was returned to the generals of the cars by Celeste, the coalition forces were more than doubled. The morale of the soldiers was all high. Some time ago, the knights of the Temple Knights lost and did not have any influence on them. In their opinion, as long as such a large army rushed into the air, when the 100,000 troops arrived outside the city of Oufu, any intrigues were absolutely in this. The superior strength of the hoof will be crushed into powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter how high the troops still have to eat, the 100,000 army’s food is a huge amount. When the coalition goes deep into the highlands, it needs a bigger grain team. It’s just one of the troops that has sent countless grains and grasses from all over the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team that escorts the grain has 500 people to deal with the wild beast. This should be far enough. It is a thousand miles away from Oufu. Moreover, there is no possibility that there will be orphan troops in the middle of the 100,000-strong army. But they did meet it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This team of food handlers has been harassed since the encounter with the orc small force of more than a dozen people two days ago. The orcs are not eager to attack the troops ten times more than themselves, but are constantly wandering around. Not a few bows and arrows were killed by the lizards. And the range of the archers in the team is completely incapable of being able to compete with the lizard. It is also impossible for the orcs to take advantage of the fact that the soldiers want to catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering the night, the soldiers began to have real nightmares. The orcs are almost no harassment attacks, but the soldiers are completely unable to tell whether the figure from the darkness is just two or three harassed individual orcs or all the forces ready to attack. The same way as harassment during the day. The orcs are all slashing and not fighting in front, but the effect is obvious. The whole team has barely got any rest time. So the next day, this fatigued team had to stop and rest only after a few miles. But this harassing sneak attack tonight has not stopped the soldiers from splitting fifty sets of turns to watch the night and even numb the harassment. Their spirit and morale slowly became exhausted and paralyzed from the beginning of the tension. But overall their morale is still at a fairly high altitude. Although they are now trapped here, but this position is actually between the army and Erasia, strictly speaking the control area of ​​the coalition, so they are not Too worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These guys must have been deserted from Oufu and wanted to find some food nearby. You can rest assured. The pigeons have been released. No matter the front The army of the back or the support troops in the back will come in two days and will wipe out the group of orcs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the captain’s words to the soldiers. Almost all the soldiers do think that the huge advantage of the coalition forces can not create a sense of crisis anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the reaction of a soldier in the team is very strange. He is not only very scared but scared. It was also horrified to report to the captain that all troops would be left behind to escape to Elazia or to join the coalition forces. According to the soldier, he used to be a hunter who was familiar with the methods used by these orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The tracking and harassment of them is a way for wolves to help when hunting prey. This kind of harassment and consumption is to let the prey fatigue while letting one or two Only the wolf will inform more of the same. If we don't take the opportunity to escape, it is a dead end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This advice is naturally not recognized by other people. I almost killed the soldier because I was talking indiscriminately. Everyone believes that this will soon end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone carefully guards the shields to protect the key." The Sentry captain ordered him not even to sound the whistle of the alarm. These two nights have been whistling for fifty times without any retreat. Any practical meaning is just that the people inside can't rest in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one such bow. Then the night was completely silent. Only the stunned cockroaches and the convulsions of the limbs were shot in the throat of the sentinel. Several sentinels were rushing to ask for help but the arrow had already worn most of the pipes in the throat including the carotid artery. The small soldier who is not transparent is not equipped with the priest. The last soldier has to draw a sword to completely end the pain of this companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"*Would you like these bastard beasts come forward in a straightforward manner? I will cut down your tail and head into your assholes." The angry soldier stood up and snorted in the darkness. The snoring seemed lonely in the empty wasteland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't call the brothers inside to sleep." The sentinel captain said tiredly. It has been used to life and death for so many years on the battlefield and this archery is an endless sneak attack that has made his spirit nearly exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don’t know if the soldier’s screaming or tired illusion captain seems to have seen several figures appearing on the edge of the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well?" The captain squinted and wanted to see it again. But in front of the eyes, a thing that spins fast and sways in front of him, he falls straight and falls down. A small axe was completely embedded in his face and only left a handle on the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of the werewolf and the lizard finally appeared in the fire. But before the soldiers fully reacted, this was just a savage vigilance and turned into a panic because the orcs who appeared in the fire were not only a dozen or so dozens but they were side by side. Hundreds of rushing to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on. Really..." The soldier who had been a hunter’s advice to the captain screamed in surprise. But his screams had just opened his head and was immediately cut off by a small axe in his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werewolf and lizard people continually rushed into the bright light of the fire from the darkness. They didn’t make any noise before. Now it started to attack and there was almost no sound. Those soft footsteps and limbs seem to be mixed with the ground and there is no barking of any beast. Like the nightmare ghosts that turned out in the night, the ghosts quietly brought fear to the front of everyone. Fifty sentinels need not say that even the exclamation and screams have turned into corpses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers in the rest of the camp were still alarmed and all picked up their weapons and wanted to fight back. But the hasty and tired human warrior will never be the unilateral scream of the orc's opponent. The orcs above have accomplished this unilateral killing of their efficiency with a surprisingly efficient skill as a butcher for many years. There was no extra action, and even a conversation between them did not seem to be a group of killing machines to quietly complete their mission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horses carrying the grain trucks have already been shocked after smelling dozens of werewolves. The wolves and the lizards transferred their targets to the animals after completing the slaughter of the soldiers. They also slaughtered them after a very short period of time. Not spending too much time, this camp has become a place full of dead in the hands of the wolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the wolf talent began to command other orcs. They concentrated all the grain but did not burn it. If you want to burn such a large pile of grain in this dark wilderness. The fire is enough to see two or three hundred miles away. After the orcs took away the parts they needed, they dismembered all the bodies on the ground and stuffed them evenly into the grain pile. They also drenched the visceral blood into these foods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drizzle is also sprinkled on these bare grasses in the open air. According to the weather in the wilderness on the high ground, as long as tomorrow, the evening of these grains in addition to flies and mites There will be no more animals willing to eat outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all this, the orcs rushed through the dark night. Because this is just the second attack. According to the information from the companions, there are at least three food handlers waiting for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten days, the army of the coalition forces finally had to stop moving forward because of the problem of food and grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The encircled party can actually cross the blockade of 100,000 troops on the wilderness without replenishment and rush to the enemy behind the enemy to harass the grain road. It is almost impossible to do one thing. But for the orcs who are good at night action, hundreds of thousands of nature are difficult to cross the front of the army, but this squad of only a dozen people is completely ok, and then they gather in the rear to take the unique wolf tactics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
