			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Top!" As Elder Lloyd yelled, all the elves looked up and saw the flying figure but the first time was a surprise rather than an alert. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun ban is not possible to use in the enchantment of the enchantment, regardless of the degree of the drop of the figure, at least from the height of the upper kilometer This is what kind of person seems to fall into the bolognese is the only result. If it wasn't for Ai Meimei, I was a little vigilant and scared. Some elves might be prepared to find a way to catch him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the guards!" Elder Lloyd did not relax at all but shouted nervously. He knows that this person is at least more than ten miles around the war tree under the height of five kilometers away from here, but the height is reduced in order to extend the radius. However, after all, it is still five kilometers high, and even the winged Pegasus and the Griffin cannot fly to such a height. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who can come close to this height from such a height and who can be pointed at the fallen leaves of the world tree will never fall into a meatloaf. It is his purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, when there were hundreds of meters above the ground, the man’s hand suddenly shook a large piece of cloth and sat on the corner with a rope. . The figure of this man began to slow down as the cloth swelled like a big umbrella and caught the air around it. The elves with good eyesight screamed and they now see this person. The black shirt looks very awkward like a bunch of unreal smoke. The most conspicuous thing is the dark golden skull mask on the face. The enchanting secret does not seem to be a person with a mask but a mask with a human form of smoke. He was covered with white frost all over the body and it was condensed under the height of several kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Necromancer!" These arrows are not so much as the screaming arrows hit the black man in the air. There was a strange roar in the strange shape of the branch, and then there were two large green balls of light whizzing out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light ball is not as thick as light, but like a bunch of leaves directly wrapped in the surface of the light ball, the energy arc is flashing Green. The arrows connecting the light balls are disintegrated and directly turned into a group of green smoke to dissipate in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer in midair suddenly let go and let go of the two ropes in the cloth in his hand. The originally bulging cloth umbrella suddenly shook into a piece of cloth. The Necromancer has slowed down and suddenly added countless arrows and two green balls that can hurt the dragon from the top of his head and flew into the sky. He continued to fall to the altar below. The height of this hundred meters is nothing but a blink of an eye. He is less than a dozen meters away from the leaves of the world tree on the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead wood warriors around the altar have long held up huge arms in the arms of Elder Lloyd, dozens of huge wooden stakes, pinching, hitting To this person in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you can't use magic unless you have wings on your back, you can't use the force to change to the dead wood warrior in any way. You can also capture this person. . A bang of sawdust, dozens of hands of dead wood warriors all hit together and sandwiched the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But only the dull sound of wood hits the woods, but there is no flesh and blood flying this dead spirit mage like a virtual shadow without a solid or a beach can be free The water of the changing shape flashes, hides, turns, sways, squats and even seems to be deformed into two or three strands and then re-aggregated. In the arms of the dead wood warriors, the tens of thousands of vertical criss-crossings collide with each other and fall straight to the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is the bastard possible?" All the elves, including Elder Lloyd, looked silly. In addition to the magic of the elves and the space magic exerted by the eyes of the stars, no magic can be applied to this solar well enchantment. But this necromancer can actually make such an incredible action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer is not necessarily only longer than magic. It is purely uncoordinated skill coordination and agile body movements. This is not or is not simply a mage. Elder Lloyd first understood and then reacted. He waved a gesture and mourned a few words while the giant poisonous bees and various poisonous insects summoned by the arrows of the elves also swept over the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer's hand shakes the black cloth that was originally used as an umbrella cloth, and the black-eyed poisonous insects and arrows are all rolled up by this black shadow. The wind is blowing. In the shadow of the darkness, the necromancer grasped the leaf of the emerald world tree. The elves shouted in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
