			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another call sign came. Asa knows that the stalker is tormenting the woman. This is the method that the race used when hunting humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he turned and ran to save people, he would be in this stupid trap and the result would be that his two heads together became an ornament to an orc tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river of Dono River is gently and gently rushing to the east for a thousand miles of waves like waving to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come on, come in and be safe, although it will be sad, but at least you will be alive. After a few years, maybe you will be indifferent to this thing. It will be forgotten in the table between the wine table and friends for a few years. You must forget it for decades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you can also use this sadness as a motivation to become a general in a few years and lead an army to sweep all the orcs on the big 6 And the revenge for this woman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third scream is already faint as if it were just an illusion of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa shouted a loud curse that he knew to turn around and rushed to the road while doing everything he could to make a scream to tell the stalker his stupidity. The trap was as effective as he had hoped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa then ran after less than ten minutes and saw the stalker and the woman he was caught in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neck black was scattered from the cloak and confusedly obscured her painful expression. Her right hand flesh and blood is distorted in the form of dead tree vines. The bones are not as good as one inch. That is not the only damage that can be caused by breaking a place and then breaking it in another place until there is no place to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azallo has peace of mind, except for this hand, she still can't see where she was fatally hurt. She was just like a chicken to be slaughtered. She was stalked by a stalker in the air. The sound from the mouth was intermittent and the claws seemed to be pinched in her neck at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with the overgrown giant claw Asa, for the first time in a broad daylight, I saw this chasing him for three days. Orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge body-shaped brown hair half a foot wider than him. It covers the whole body of tall ears, yellow pupils, narrow mouth, a dog-like head. It is only a werewolf. The proportion of each part of the body is about the same as that of human beings, but the perfect curve of muscles and bones also shows that the strength and agility contained in this body are hard to reach. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The werewolf was wearing a special leather armor. The meteor hammer that had crushed Asa’s dozen colleagues’ heads was obviously also a special human and dwarf. Use such a huge weapon. This terrible arm and his body complement each other enough for him to deal with a whole team of soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this werewolf doesn’t seem to be so prestige and dangerous, or even a little wolf. The hair of the left arm has been condensed into a mass of wounds that are still bleeding slowly. Anka Sword does not reduce its lethality because it can't be used for chopping. The unique blade is pierced into the body. Once it is rotated, it will rip all the surrounding blood vessels and tissues. The slender blade is dwarf. The forged alloys can even pierce the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a blackened group on the back of the left paw that can be seen. The fur around the burnt bones has been burnt. This is the trace of fireball. . Look at the slight focus of the fur on his head to know that this was originally a fireball that was shot at his face and was blocked by his hand when he could not escape. The timing of this fireball must be very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you deal with the woman, the odds of the stalker are actually great, Asa feels extremely regrettable. Now it’s only a matter of strength. There should be hope. After all, the stalker’s left arm has been <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stalker’s snoring opens his mouth to reveal sharpness. The tooth moved the shoulder. Asa did not understand the meaning of this expression but he clearly saw the muscles on the claw that caught the woman bulging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prey has come to the point that it has reached the bait and it is useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stop!" Asa yelled and yelled at the stalker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa condensed like a shrimp into a mass of blood and spit from the nose and mouth. Fortunately, the ribs have been broken and not inserted into the internal organs. There are countless heads in the chest cavity, and the other rushes of the left and right sides of the chest are not able to do anything except the other feelings of pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really the end of the addiction. Looking at the prey that made him so much thought in these three days, it was such a frightened stalker who was disappointed. Originally he was looking forward to ending with a wonderful kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, when he showed a clear footprint and smell next to the campfire, he definitely thought it was a trap. How can this embarrassing prey seem to show itself to others? It must be a trick. So he chased another line that didn't seem like much. When his own judgment was actually wrong and was deceived by the prey of this prey, he was completely astonished and annoyed and completely angered him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this other human combat power is even more unexpected. He was almost blown up by a fireball. Fortunately, this human being is also very vulnerable. After breaking his hand, he immediately lost his fighting power because of severe pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is ultimately his own victory. I was very successful in tempting the escaped prey and now I can go over and easily unscrew my head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to be so fast. Take a sneak peek at the slightest process to see what this human being will do when it comes to knowing that life is about to end. It is also an interesting ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last play a trick? Still struggling? Or is it a squabble of tears and a wailing? It’s best not to come here and have seen it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa was so hard that she snorted and ribs between the ribs were filled with knives and kept moving up and down with the breath. He barely looked up and saw that the white pulp secreted from the knives in the tree was full of knives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recognizes that the straight roots above this tree once reminded him of an almost shameless statement. Now he remembered the grief of the woman who had looked at the ground and had no embarrassment. He stood up and pulled the knife out of the trunk. Use all the strength in your body to lift the knife forward and rush forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stalker looked at the oncoming hunter almost in a poor state of mind. This action that is as slow as a tortoise and has a clear trajectory is your last struggle? You can even see the pulsation of each of your muscles and the distortion of the movements caused by the pain to see where the knife is falling where it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stalker raised the handle of the meteor hammer in his hand without any deviation blocking the bang of the metal. As expected, the knife and the hand were bounced together with the body and were shaken back. The chest and the abdomen were wide open. Just pull the paw straight from below and pull the hot heart out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the stalker didn’t anticipate a detail that didn’t seem to matter. The sap on the knife is turned into countless droplets under intense vibration and splashed into the eyes of the stalker and the wet nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that the sap is a thousand knives that have been smashed and smashed and smashed and burnt red. The stalker screamed for a screaming scream that he had never heard before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world was completely replaced by this pain. The vision is first and the red is completely black. The nose is gone. There is nothing but pain and even the screams of the ears. Then the only remaining body feels that a cold thing has been stuffed from the belly into the body until it reaches the chest. It is not so laborious but it is determined to squeeze out its position from the originally neatly arranged internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fear that even concealed the pain swarmed and the stalker subconsciously took a thing under the lower abdomen and used all his strength and fear. . Then he heard another scream that was not inferior to his screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa couldn’t hear the sound of his wrist bones broken into pieces. He could only feel the innumerable bones in the middle of the muscles and blood vessels and the sudden rise from the skin. He didn't force him. He didn't have the slightest strength. He used this huge sting to bend his knees to the handle. The elastic rupture of the heart muscle is uploaded from the handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stalker suddenly stopped the call sign and slammed his chest to force the sharp claw tip to insert his own fur through the leather arm as if he wanted to put it inside. The broken thing is back to its original shape. But after a few steps, he fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
