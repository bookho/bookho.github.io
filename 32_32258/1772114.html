			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whispering of the deepest elves in the central conference hall, a few huge and unique fireflies out of the milky white light, the space in the middle of this huge ancient tree hole illuminate. This long meeting has continued from this afternoon to this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an explosion of explosions and percussions in the meeting. After the scout reconnaissance, the magical explosion outside the enchantment and an evil stone statue rushed into it. The enchantment was enchanted and dispelled by the magic power above and became a bunch of ordinary stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This result of reconnaissance also made the conclusions of the meeting more powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Clan stood up and decided: The accident just confirmed that the effect of the great solar well enchantment is still irresistible, no matter what kind of magic power The whispering of the forest can not work. Although the deterrent effect on human beings has been reduced a lot, they should have been feared after many people who have cleared the forest. So we will keep the status quo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The status quo? Then we have been discussing for so long without any results?" Elf girl Luya got up and looked a little excited. I reiterate my suggestion once again: in the current situation, we should communicate with humans to solve problems together. The evil spirits scattered on the stone statues outside the forest, although they can't feel it, are clearly the ignorant human beings who are there to pray at the leaves of the world tree. We must act to be better with the power of humanity and to make it clear to them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everything we have already vetoed." Another elf elder is cold Interrupt her coldly. The stupid and vulgar creatures are even controlled by others. Do we still have to explain to them? And we also don't need the help of vulgar humans. Direct melee combat has no creatures to compete with the dead wood guards, and we and the unicorns help. We have been using this method of guarding for tens of thousands of years, no matter what kind of enemy can be dealt with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luya anxiously looked at the silver of the elders as they flowed. "But now the situation is different. Because of the lack of two world tree leaves, the sun power of the sun has almost no human existence. It is sooner or later they invade our forest."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In order to prevent this, all the dead wood guards are concentrated around the sun well. No one can steal the leaves of the world tree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Luya sighed and sighed and looked at all the elder elders in the room with a helpless voice: "Why do we have to wait here to wait for problems and not take the initiative to solve the problem?" and other elves have a frosty expression Compared with her tone, she seems to be the only living creature in this ancient tree hall. This strong emotion is even more vibrant in her beautiful appearance, even if it is anxious and helpless. "I don't need to deal with humans. We can also temporarily expand the scope of the dry wood guards to get them out of the forest to smash those evil stone statues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Clan Faintly veto: "This is absolutely impossible. You will not know the rules of the family. Whether we are a unicorn or a dead wood guard, we will never be able to leave the whisper." The last time you left it is a special case. The special case in it must not be easily committed again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rules." Luya’s tone and face became as cold as other elves, but this is her One of your own expressions rather than the faces of other elves. "I also clearly remember that the last time the man with the leaves of the world tree escaped was already seriously injured. Our rule helped him so much that he slowly escaped under our eyelids. It is us. The rules let us lose the leaves of the world tree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one answered this time all the other elves kept the cold and indifferent face. The elders of the half-kran Clan said coldly and succinctly: "The rules are the rules. That is the code that the law of all things is made for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "If the rules become binding, it makes no sense." Luya looked around the compatriots, and all the helpless eyes flashed a desolate beauty. "I have left the whispering sensation to see it outside before I understand that we are too rigid and conservative. We always think that we are too high-spirited and disregarded with other races. Humans only regard us as a small and weird race. Our voice ignores those inferior orcs only because they have built a strong nation. Humans have to change their past attitudes to recognize their status and establish contacts with them. We must be with the companions of the Tulaolin forest. They unite to make our races have a place in this big 6 power distribution. Otherwise we can only be "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not denying that the teachings of the great Marfa are only the present situation"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I announced the end of the meeting." Elder Clan underestimated but interrupted very thoroughly Luya’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves elders stood up together and walked out of the conference hall. Luya and Elder Clan went to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know how many countries and races have been destroyed in tens of thousands of years?" In the case of only two people, the tone of Elder Clan did not appear. It’s so cold. "That is the pursuit of strength and the pursuit of progress. The inevitable pursuit of power, such as leading to self-control and progress, leads to mutual struggle, so that the two will continue to show up. The final result must be destruction. Our closed and conservative is ours. The fact that a family can live peacefully for tens of thousands of years is an unchangeable part of our civilization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the situation is different now"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter what is different outside, we just have to do what we should do." Elder Clan patted Luya's shoulder and said softly. "Go back, don't think about it anymore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luya walked back to his old tree silently. The tree house that entered the top of the tree seemed to be an extension of this boring feeling. There was also a nasty smell in the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was very upset when she sat on a bed weaved by the tree vines. She was just about to get up and go out to breathe. The feeling of sudden danger was on her mind. It was not the illusion of mood. Instead, there was indeed a smell of smell in the house and another smell mixed with human smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rushed to the door, but the smell immediately rushed up to knock her down to the ground. One hand licked her nose and mouth and the other hand buckled her slender hands together and pressed her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luya struggled a few times but did not use her as if she had been nailed to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't move, don't make a noise. I have a very important thing to discuss with you here." The tone of this person seems to be anxious than Luya. . "You must not say anything. If you call someone else, I will only run. It is not good for everyone. What I want to say is that your own safety is about the statues outside. Do you understand?" I understood the nod."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luya nodded. The hand that held her mouth loosened and saw that she did not yell, and slowly let go of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you still dare to come here?" Luya stood up and took a step back with hostility. She has heard from the voice who this person is. But I don't know why this person has a burnt smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You listen to me have a very important thing to tell you. The Necromancer Association, the dark servant you said, will attack the whispering noon tomorrow at noon. The statues outside the forest are where they are placed to deal with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You make things clear." Although the whole genie dreams of catching The criminal who lived was in front of him but the words he said in his mouth were more weighty. Lucia reached out and waved a magical firefly for lighting. The small light from the palm of her hand illumined the tree house. She only saw that the man in front of him was burnt and ruined and not even spared. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, relying on the whispering edge of the whisper, there is the fluctuation of the sun well. Asa can use a fireball to stop the thunder bomb from the Necromancer. However, the shock and flame caused by the explosion also caused him to suffer a slight injury. He fell from the air in the depths of the forest and stunned him. Fortunately, the treatment of the forest that was full of fluctuations in the sun's wells immediately restored him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whispering murder of the whispering omnipotent murderer did not appear to have something in it. Asa thought about going to the elf’s place of residence. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning, he only planned to solve this paganism in three, five, and two places, but did not expect to hide the conspiracy of the Necromancer. He now feels powerless except for the horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is now the imperial minister, although he holds thousands of people in his hand, but the matter has now reached the point where it is indeed as the necromancer said that it has not returned to heaven. Forced. At least 5,000 devout believers will become the food of the gargoyles at noon tomorrow. Then the gargoyles will take the offensive and kill all the elves here to take the leaves of the world tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, even if he went out, he smoothly joined the organization and became the comrade of the two Necromancers. He could never convince them to stop the plan. This is a plan that all members except Ved Nina will join together and will never stop because of the benevolence of a newcomer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is only one hope, then you can only come to the whispering forest to touch the elves' luck and see if they can join hands with them. After all, the necromancers are going to deal with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the elves are so stubborn that he has long experienced that he will not believe any of his criminals who have escaped from his own promise to steal the leaves of the world tree. The only thing that entertains him is the overwhelming arrow rain. Now that he has no Ghost of the Ghost King, he will no longer dare to become a hedgehog. He will walk into the Elf station with great light. Considering that he and he quietly touched Luya here. In his impression of all the elves, only she seems to be able to communicate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Asa’s story, Luya thought coldly and said, “Why should I believe in you? I believe in a despicable human being who violates his vows. How do I know that you are not a dark servant sent to exercise your intrigues? The deterrent power of the forest to mankind is because you have taken away the leaves of the world tree and now we have to concentrate the dead wood guards on the sun. Well there"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa language. This unexpected problem made him really unable to answer. After a pause, he sighed helplessly and looked at Lucia heavy but calmly said: "I can only say this. Believe it or not, you can only get it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Luya did not speak and looked at him. Under the glimmer of the magic fireflies, a pair of the most skillful artists sculpted their eyes with the most precious gemstones and the other pair of eyes were all silently covered with dust and scorch around the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half a day, Luya finally whispered: "Even the legendary dragon can't compete with the sacred power of the Sunwell. Any foreigner in the whispering forest." The magic power will be ineffective, no matter what sorcerer they use, the evil ones will never enter this. We don't have to worry about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know them Can you enter the forest? I only know that the Necromancers are definitely smarter than me and smarter than you. They will never just be greeted by the gargoyles just to scare you." Asa patience shows Luya the solution. Method. "In fact, it is very simple for you to solve this problem. As long as you appear in front of the believers, tell them what the forest is all about. Let them see the dead wood guards and let them understand that those natural gods are all ghosts. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think we will stand up and explain to the stupid humans and show them the dead wood guards like the exhibits?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't bother to explain that you will simply command the dead wood guards to kill the gargoyles. They have been outside your forest for a few months. Why do you all wait?" Questioning students and not actively solving problems?" Asa was in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether we are a unicorn or a dead wood guard, we can never leave the whispering singer. This is the rule that the great Marfa gave us." Luya felt that there was a strange feeling. These words were just mentioned to the elders in the meeting. Now she still has to reject the words of the elders. This unprecedented strange feeling unconsciously changed into an expression on her face like never before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is very incomprehensible, but the expression of the elf girl in front of him makes Asa look so good that the fire can't come out. Under the faint light, although this smile has a bitter taste, it is enough for anyone to stop thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa didn’t say anything more. After a moment of silence, he said slowly: "I will lead the army to destroy the stone statues by noon tomorrow. You are Come help or hold the scented rules in the hole like these mouse holes and be killed and become zombies. You can do it yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; After leaving this sentence, he turned and slid out of the tree house and slid down the ground without a trace of silence. He was completely integrated into the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luya looked at the figure in the tall tree house and disappeared and sighed. She does not believe but she knows that the elders will never believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky just showed a trace of fish belly white local official's mansion was stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
