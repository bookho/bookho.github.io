			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the flame body completely covered a man's body, the cow's head sacrifice finally breathed a sigh of relief. But the heart that he mentioned had not been able to let go, and he was immediately scared to spit out almost from his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the scream of the scream of the scream of the scream of the singer of the singer. Although this sound does not have the penetrating power of the Black Dragon and the power of the soul, but the overflowing power directly shocks everyone. Even if you are embarrassed, you can feel the power of this snoring. The power of this sound can be felt clearly without using the skin and the muscles. The air in the entire cave is shaking in this squeak, trembling, countless above. Small rocks are also falling with the sound of this sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Niu Tau Sacrifice was directly stunned by this sound and fell to the ground. Even the Knights of the Temple can not help but make a slap in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the roar, the body of the fire element giant exploded. The body of the fire element is as fragile as the mist, and the red-yellow body is torn by the white vindictive light. Asa still did not move in the same place, and the giant of the elements covering him was directly smashed into pieces by his vindictiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot, at the very center of the gravity field, still couldn’t move, his face and eyes were horrified, and even the Knights of the Shrine were fired. When the element is alive and burning, his expression can be made without any fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very clear about what this vindictive weight means. If this scene appears on Gru, he will not be surprised, but it appears on Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the second fire element rushed over, the thin man who fell with Asa greeted him. That is Rod Hart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt did not use the weapon, he almost slammed into the arms of this fire element. There is no smothering body on his body surface, and the burning sound of the cockroach and the smell of the body burnt out of his body, and this odor has a strong rancid smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt is moving in the body of the Flame Giant. Under the action of this gravitational field, his movements are quite fast, but no matter how fast, he seems to be unable to do anything with elemental creatures such as fire elements. However, the body of the Fire Elemental Giant was constantly distorted and weakened with the action of Rhodehart, and the last wailing disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elements of the fire are scattered. The exposed Rhodes Hart, his whole body has been completely different from coke, like a broken statue carved out of charcoal, carbonized the muscles and skin with black smoke and strong smell, a piece of pleasure The ground flakes under gravity. The only good thing is his right hand, with a piece of black ice on it, which is the result of his magical magic in the water magic mixture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of water magic to cut the core of the element in the fire element is undoubtedly the most effective way to fire elemental creatures. To accurately capture the core of several elements inside the fire element, it seems that drilling into the body is also the only way. Only no one has ever thought of using such a method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa naturally will not know to know this method. This is what Rhodehart himself came up with under such circumstances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not only his magical power but also their judgment and intelligence. What is the top transformation of Necromancer? Something like zombies. Except that he is not self-aware and can't be alive, he is no worse at any point than when he is alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trembling of the ground is beginning to weaken. The effect of the gravity field is slowly disappearing. The knight's body is slowly relaxed, but their mood is only getting heavier and heavier. They felt the smell of Rodhart's body. It was not the smell of bio-energy. Just the speed of his movements, the speed of this person who is not human is even faster than them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in any case, they all know that they must stop a person who treats the black dragon. The two sword-ridden knights gather all the vindictiveness and strength that slowly accumulate. , rushed to Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But a body like a muscle fortress is in front of them, it is Helicika. His huge body was completely in front of Asa. Like Rodehart, he was bare-handed and had no weapons. He waved two huge fists and hit two Knights of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two shimmering white radiant swords smashed into the gray muscles. It is not wrong to judge with the shrine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this undead monster, even if it is impossible to kill. Breaking your hands and feet is also the most effective way, but they judged that the wrong one is not able to completely cut off the arm of the ordinary person's thigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ones that can be used by the Knights of the Temple are the finest of magical weapons. After pouring their vindictiveness, even a steel-cast arm can It's easy to cut off, and the arm of Hilika is definitely not steel. However, the Knights of the Temple found that the steel was still difficult. The gray muscles are not only hard, but also the toughness and elasticity are full. The two long swords can only be cut into the bones, and the above strength and vindictiveness have been eliminated and cannot be penetrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika has a child’s head-sized fist banging on the chest of two knights, and the muffled sound seems to be two siege cars hitting The voice of the city gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two shrine knights are really like the siege car’s giant hammer hitting the same body volley and flying out, the glorious armor at the chest just in Morley After a blow, it was already recessed, and now it is almost recessed into their chest. After the landing, the blood overflowed from the mouth of the two people. Finally, they found that when the sword was cut into the arm, they found that it was not right. They fully dissipated and dispelled most of the power. This injury is not too heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the punch’s psychological blow to them has been too heavy to be heavy. Although the consumption of vindictiveness and strength is quite a lot, their condition can only be regarded as half of the peak, but they are the Knights of the Temple after all, and they are the top fighters in the mainland, and even one face can not stand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of this punch is almost the same as the one that Morrier just hit on their chest. And the two Knights of the Temple can feel that the curse of the Necromancer spells has been spread from the opponent's body. Fortunately, the Glorious Battlegear has a special resistance to the curse, otherwise they will stand even now. impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bang, a bolt of lightning emanating from the wand on the hand of the Tauren outside the cave, and making an arc on the Helica. Then with the curse of the Niu Tau Sacrifice, there was another sharp stone pillar protruding from the ground and slamming into the body of Helicika. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Niu Tau Sacrifice outside the cave just climbed from the ground and waved his wand inside. At this time, there is no clear boundary between the enemy and the enemy, as long as it can stop the man's treatment of the black dragon. He hopes to use this magic to contain this muscle fortress-like monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the white arc seemed to have no effect on the body of the Helicika, and the stone column crashed into his body and immediately shattered, his muscles The fortress did not shake even. The only effect of this lightning technique seems to be that Helicia has noticed the sacrifice of the bullhead. The only effect of this lightning technique seems to be that Helicia only noticed the sacrifice of the bullhead. He twisted the huge <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the skull turned to the head of the ox, and Mu's eyes made the head of the oxen almost fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Tauren Sacrifice immediately reminded himself not to be afraid. Although the gravity field is weakened, it is still effective. Although this monster is terrible, it is not easy to exceed this long distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika did not try to come over, he just took the left hand of his left hand and pulled it out, then raised his hand, this finger With a strong wind breaking the wind, the horns flew past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final Niu Tau Sacrifice has always been very vigilant, and while Helica waved his hand, he rolled to the side to dodge, this interception just rubbed his head and flew over , hit the rock wall not far behind him. It’s just that this finger is so powerful that when it hits the rock wall, it smashes itself. The tiny inner pieces and the black juice splash around, and it also splashes on the body of the ox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Niu Tau Sacrifice screams almost like the roar of Asa’s, just like a fish that was suddenly thrown into the pan, smashed from the ground. The air also rolled over two turns, and then fell off without any breath and noisy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilskay has stood up and opened the golden war bow to catch a broken magic arrow. But his hands are not loose, not afraid to loose. He knew that this arrow couldn't shoot the muscle monster anyway, let alone the Asa behind. And if the monster then throws a finger or even an arm, he knows that he can't afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
