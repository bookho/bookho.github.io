			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the two people who have never experienced the breath of the Dark Star, the king of the dead spirit that destroyed the world is only a legend. Even if you know that it can be used by the Necromancers to determine the fate of the gods, the weight of this legend is not too light, but it is too ridiculous. The two magical masters who hold the powers, even though they can reasonably believe, are still unacceptable in feelings. This great world will not be used for a long time and will be destroyed by a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandenda Lord thought about it and said, "If you need all the magic scrolls of our Tower of Teeth, you can provide them. There are several and close to the curse. The great magic. If we add all of our elements, the magician does not exaggerate to say that it is not difficult to level a small country..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This group of undead The range of gas seems to be just over a dozen miles." Aideli master interface. "Even if all of the dead monsters in the dragon are aggregated, all of us here have enough power to destroy them all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The problem is not that the undead lies in The King of the Dead. The undead monsters can't be completely destroyed within his breath. Even if it is broken into pieces, it will slowly reunite because of the darkness. And now the power of the King of the Dead is not just The condensed form was comparable at the time. He would not turn a blind eye to the enemy. Before using the doomsday trial, the instinct drove him to destroy all obstacles on the road." Elf elder Longy opened. Although it didn't take long for him to look older, the wrinkles had already covered every inch of his skin. It was like a centuries old man who even spoke with his voice and movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you use the curse?" Audley smiled and finally pulled out from the map and looked at Elder Lloyd. "In this case, as long as Elder Lloyd, you can reveal the magical techniques of the ancient elf empire to us. The power of us here is believed to be a meteor fire. It is not difficult to call these top scrolls as long as we keep using them. Curse..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, what time is it. You, Adelaide, don't stare at these ideas..." Elder Lloyd saw Adriatic At first glance, his eyes look murky and black and white are almost inseparable, and there is a scent of scent in the eyes. "When the ancient elves empire, even the power of all the elves, even the titans and the dragons, did not prevent the elf king who became the king of the undead to start the final judgment... I believe that even the two towers of the main magic and antiquity The wizard's magic technology is nothing compared to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two towers were ugly and ugly, but in the end they didn’t say anything but just looked at the table. The magic map sighed for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And have you not seen me like this? Using my human standards to measure me is actually just a teenager but I can still have up to two or three years. The life of the land is over. This is the punishment of Mafa for all the spy-spirited elves. This is because I just showed this map to you... even if Marfa bless this thing, the map will be completely destroyed. I am together..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aidley does not seem to give up. Say: "I don't know if you can say that Marfa can help us? Since he has the ability to create the world tree leaves and sun wells..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Mafa is the mother of the earth is the mother of all things, the dark star is the darkness of all the creatures on the whole big 6. From a certain point of view, it is actually the weapon used by Mafa to clean this big 6 A world that has been tempered by too much and is on the brink of collapse..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Is Marfa not the patron saint of your elves? That can refrain from the dark stars. The world tree leaves and the sun wells are not..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can the great mother of all things protect a family? The so-called greatness is selflessness, you know the word What is the meaning? In her eyes, there is no essential difference between the ants and the dragons. It is just that there is a very small number of elves before the destruction of the ancient elf empire, which touched her will and pulse and then survived and then worshipped her wishfully. Nothing... you didn’t see even our vitality. Only the will that follows Marfa can be continued. As for the world tree leaves and the magicians of the Sunwell Elf Empire, they finally made these kinds of instruments according to the pulse of Mafa, but I think...that is actually the black star Essentially the same... But one is the condensed life and the source of life. One is the condensation of death and darkness..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Polu The eyes of the dry man seem to be falling out at any time. Open your mouth. “Can you create two diametrically opposite artifacts? This is totally uncoordinated...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you say that the two things are actually the same?" The expression of Bolugan’s expression was distorted by the hard work of thinking. The face that was originally like a big pie was now like a piece of pie that was smashed for a while and then punched. "This... seems to be illogical..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's just your logic or the logic of human beings. Don't cut back to understand things you can't understand." Just like the mossy fungus that was born only in the morning, it won't be understood as there is day and night. If you want to make a fight, you can understand that we are nothing but a vast expanse of the world. Some dusty methods have never looked after us. Will care about anything that just evolves the world according to her own rules... The catastrophe that we are facing now is just a process in this countless evolutions that is equally insignificant..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloogan adults still tried to think about it and finally sighed and twisted the face back to the original shape. "I'm sorry, I still can't understand what your old god stick is saying..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you don't understand, then." Elder Lloyd's wrinkles overlapped with a smile. The turbid eyes swept over the faces of several people around him. "These are just my violation of the teachings of Mafa. Feel free to explore the speculations of the real fallen elves. These real originals are also things I should not know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The faces of Lancome and Aideli are still full of thoughts. It seems that some of them seem to be even more puzzled. It’s not the same as the Oufu agent who uses the logic to explain everything. As the top magician with the highest comprehension, they can grab some of the things inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These things are known and useless. We still have to do it. Elder Lloyd, you believe this with a magic map is not because Discuss these places.” The Pope’s expression did not fluctuate. I don’t know if he understood it completely or didn’t understand it at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light cough. The female prime minister slammed the atmosphere that was inconsistent with the meeting. "It’s a good esoteric philosophy and theological topic. So let’s talk about something more practical."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s head is also like his eyes. It has always been so tough and tough without hesitation. "Do you just say how you can destroy the king of the dead spirit? What can we do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Lloyd nodded and slowly used him to sound They are all dry and rotten voices saying: "Our only hope is that this king of the dead is not complete, so even our ceremonial gathering is not complete. We are also hopeful... as long as we gather all the fighting power Take a path in the countless undead monsters. The force of our ceremonial assembly on the dark star may destroy the black star's hilt..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, what ritual are you talking about? I don't understand what kind of buddies are you doing now?" Prime Minister asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just her face is completely puzzled. The head of the tower of the two towers of the head of the tower of Roland, the leader of the Roland, is also puzzled. Only the Pope and Lancelot are still as calm as the Pope just sighed. Said: "It is not the present, but the whispering whispers that have been repeated for thousands of years. The rituals of the sun well and the leaves of the world tree are integrated into the elf body of each generation with the blood of the elf king. When the star broke again, the chest of the elf was sent to the sword of the Dark Star..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Elder Lloyd saw the pope. "This has been performed numerous times and the ritual was originally intended to prepare for the appearance of the Dark Star. This time it was only useful. This time the ritual was destroyed. It was destroyed by a human being who broke into the whisper of the world tree. The power that should be poured into the elf body was all absorbed by him. Unfortunately, those forces are incompatible with the human body, so this ceremony is not complete..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Fortunately, the dark star is not complete, it is just a hilt. So there is still a chance?" The Pope also looked at Elder Lloyd. "In fact, I just finished this ritual and I will help you with it... and it is not so easy to finish the story now. At least we still need the consent of the person or the person who wants to die." The possibility of destroying the Dark Star. Of course, there are other ways just to be in trouble..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope’s voice paused the eyes of both him and Elder Lloyd. At the same time, I seemed to have a tacit understanding at the same time and said, "Put him to the king of the Necromancer and let the King of the Necromancer pass his body with the hilt of the Black Star."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
