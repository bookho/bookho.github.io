			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ha ha ha ha..." Bishop Jia Wei laughed at the purple blood of his mouth and fluctuated. The original Fengshen handsome and extraordinary, he looked a little embarrassed. He looked at the person in front and laughed: "There is a road in heaven. You don't have to go to hell. You have to get in. You think you can use it to turn around and turn around to reverse the situation?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'嘎啦' Asa took a step forward from the debris of marble. He took the Javy sword and did not retreat, but the marble floor under his feet was crushed by the tremendous power and momentum that was passed down. Although he did not retire with Javey and did not vomit blood, he knew that his injuries could only be heavier than the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Jia Wei is a powerful and earth-shattering full-strength sword, but he is just rushing to resist after the full use of magic. If the quality and power of the vampire's teeth in his hand is far better than the long sword of Bishop Javi, I am afraid that he is no longer able to stand. He watched Bishop Javey shaking his head and said, "You didn't go to the Magic Academy? I thought that Talis, where I arranged there, could drag you down for a while..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to admit that your trap is effective. You know what kind of lie can cause the greatest panic to me and you are really smart in this game. So you entered here. Fortunately, I am Halfway, I woke up and rushed back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wake up? Did you think that something is wrong? I thought you were sure that even your judgment would be gone." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really important for me to do this, and I can’t even think about it. But I’m not trying to understand this in the middle of the road. It’s feeling. I feel that you can’t go to that thing...” Jia Wei’s squint looked at Asa and asked, “I even wonder if you know what is there?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't know until then. Otherwise, when you tortured Jessica I said it. I heard about your strange behavior when I returned to the School of Magic to find Sandru. I only judged that there was something you wanted below and it was like the Marquis came back and called you out. And Sandro and I vaguely mentioned what he was going to guard here, so I judged that the following things are absolutely heavy and are the things of the Necromancer. Yes..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be smarter than you think...but it's not the time to talk to you about this nonsense... This time I caught you and I decided to cut all your hands and feet first. Then slowly ask..." Bishop Jia Wei stunned and looked at the airflow that had just been played by the two men. The ministers climbed back and the swordsmen of the Paladins arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa faintly sneered: "Do you know that you can take me down?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I know that you are not hurting now. You don't have to be there to do anything." Bishop Jia Wei looked at him coldly. The samurai swordsmen have swarmed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rod was specially rolled up in the airstream that had just been blown out and fell to the wall and then fell to the ground and did not move. Although he could barely stand before, the bones in his chest were indeed broken. The broken bones seemed to be inserted into the internal organs. Now the two pastors who rushed into the hall were helping him. Although there are few magicians and priests in the Paladin, the magic level of any one of them is the leader of the empire. The level of the two priests' white magic can be compared with the ordinary bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of Jawi wiped the blood of his mouth and regained his enthusiasm and smiled in front of him. "I said This is a dead end. It can't be broken. Now it's best for you to get in and die. You and I should all know that it is impossible for someone to rush out in this group of Paladins, even Gru and Cedros. Impossible.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa faintly replied: "I said I want to rush out?" Then I also told you that this game has been broken. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please, you, come, break, give, me, watch." Bishop Jia Wei sneered and spit out a string of words and waved to the dense swordsman who had stood behind. "Take this murderer." There is no need to worry about it except to ask him to live. It doesn't matter if he cuts his hands and feet. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the hands of the Cardinal's hand, dozens of long swords are coming out together. A white sword light brings out the sky. The temperature of the murderous entire hall seems to have dropped by several degrees. At the same time, Asa snorted. The white smothering light suddenly ignited.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that Javey’s words are correct. Almost every magician in the swordsman is close to the level of the great magician. The ten people who use the curse at the same time may even be able to compromise even if Gru is here. And the hundreds of swordsmen in front of it are all the standard masters. The perfect way is to fight the battle. No matter how strong the strong is, it is impossible to get out of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" This time a voice sounded. A person stood up from the debris on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Queen of the Queen." The ministers exclaimed at the same time. The sound is all ecstasy. The prime minister was not so surprised, but when she saw the queen standing up, she was so happy that she had tears in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bed is closest to Asa. In the moment he just hit the intercourse with Bishop Jia Wei, he was smashed by the waves and the body of the queen was also Buried in it. Now she stood up from the debris herself. The Queen’s mouth had no two scary fangs. And the expression has completely disappeared from the usual shackles and distortions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone is going to stop." The Queen stood up with anger and reached out and pointed out that it was the Cardinal. "He is the guilty culprit. He is the necromancer! It is he who turned me into a vampire. I have to swear that I will summon the ministers of the Marquis of the Lord of Minsk, General Thomas, to assassinate me. I did not promise them that they caught me. Magic makes me crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is stunned by this sentence, even the nerves are like steel casting only know the battle of the Paladin The captains of the swordsmen were stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt and Bishop Javey were both horrified at the same time but at the same time the flash of cold did not appear to be very confusing. The cardinal whispered aloud: "This guy used the black magic to control the mind of the queen to take him down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although for Asa It was a little surprised to be able to hack his double ban on the use of white magic to seal the control of the Necromancer, but Bishop Javey was not very worried. A vampire queen who just had to bite to accuse a pope appointed by the Pope is a Necromancer, especially since she was only used to use black magic throughout the body. It is obviously not too convincing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, another person jumped out to the Queen’s front and shouted: “All the empresses are all true. He is The murderer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsmen who were going to come forward immediately stood still. This is the prime minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait." The old minister of Jensen also stood up at this time. He looked at Bishop Javey and the Queen with some hesitation. "It's a bit strange..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't you see that it was the assassination of Bishop Ronis and the Duke of Mulak? Do you still think he is Innocent?” The voice of Bishop Jia Wei has already shown anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Jensen sighed. "Because he was the murderer of the Duke of Mulak, I wondered how the prime minister would innocently cover the murderer who killed his father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is Because she also got the mental magic of the wanted man." Cardinal said coldly and waved again. "Catch the prime minister and I will help her to eliminate this magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Rhode Hart woke up under the treatment of the priest and gasped. Say: "That's right. Take him down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have to fight for me, don't move."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence comes out all the people are holding on to the same time. Because it is actually Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the reason why everyone settles and stays is not just because he talks but because he pulls the prime minister and the queen together from the back and puts the hand on On their necks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't move here, one of the queens is a queen. The prime minister is a man who can't be less empire. Don't force me to kill them." Asa I glanced at the audience and then set my sights on the face of Bishop Javey. "The bishops believe that you will not ignore the lives of both of them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I forgive you not to dare to do it." Bishop Jia Wei's cold voice There seems to be no change, but his face is already ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
