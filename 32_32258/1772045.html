			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening carriage received a guest for the Ducal Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a strange guest and the gorgeous carriage does not match at all, even the coachman of the carriage is more glamorous than him. There was a very old and dirty robes on his body that seemed to be unspeakable and even his face was covered in a robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of the people of the Dukes is very high. So even if I saw the Duke’s smile and personally greeted the guest, I did not show the slightest surprise and still do what I should do. Only they remember that even the prospective family of the Duke of El Niño seems to have never received such a courtesy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I told the bishop to come here." Just entered the living room with the Duke and sat down with Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke smiled, and recruited a man to take the knife of Asa and walked over. The duke took the knife and handed it to Asa and ordered all the others to leave. There are only two of them left in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can see that this young man has no hostility and no timidity when he says this. He is not threatening his opponent to intimidate the other party, ‘you better not move me’, but to show that you are prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of enthusiasm, the hospitality is still so clear. This is a person who has a heart but does not like to play tricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke likes such a person. Although his mindfulness is rarely comparable to others, he still likes the straightforwardness of such people. Even as an enemy is a happy opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he has a relatively strong personality for this young man. He wore a worn robes and came to the palatial ducal palace, although he showed unruly and clumsy expressions everywhere but he was not humble. This is a person who is quite self-aware and does not care about power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a rare person. The most promising people who have the power to buy people's hearts and powers seem to have such a hard way for these immune-like scammers to have such a hard way to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Duke likes this type of people. In fact, the most basic and simple way for them to use them is to let them feel that they are actually If it is right, he will come to you unconsciously and be more reliable than buying anything. It’s just that people who are used to buying others are also narrow-minded and think that the people in the world will only benefit if they benefit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So even the guest can be saved directly. The Duke came to the door and said, "You can rest assured that the bishops are now open. Who else has the courage to move you? I want to protect your integrity. If you have any responsibility, it will be on my head." The expression is very gentle and the tone is very arrogant. There is no such thing as deliberately flattering and flattering. It is just chatting with a friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nodded. Regaining the knife again seems to be reconnected with an old friend who has been separated for many years. A feeling of stability is regaining my heart. Even if he is ignorant of politics and power, he knows what the status of the bishop is. The Duke’s straightforward explanation of the words made him more than half of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke immediately said more straightforwardly: "In fact, I always wanted to kill you." This kind of direct person must also be very direct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa frowning asks: "What is the mouth?" He was surprised by this reason but also had some unexpected feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The thing that your army is completely destroyed by the orcs in the west cannot be known to others." The Duke was still very happy and straightforward. "That is a very confidential military situation. It is absolutely necessary to ban diarrhea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nodded. This is why the Duke ordered him to be killed immediately on the spot. 's reason. This is the root of all the troubles in two months. Now he finally understands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike some of his original expectations, the Duke was very calm and straightforward to say his maliciousness and its origins. But he can also feel that the Duke did not lie to him. This also made him feel that the Duke was not a sinister and sinister person who made him believe that the Duke had been very sincere to invite him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This message is very valuable. The people of your army did not sacrifice in vain. It is only if this news flows into the hands of some impersonating people in the court. The consequences are unimaginable." The Duke screamed at him. "Have you told anyone about this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke smiled and nodded and said, "That's good. In fact, I have always disliked this nasty secret method, but this is the rule."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What? All major secrets are kept secret by using the method of killing?” Asa was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke nodded: "Of course. As long as you know not many people, you use this method. You think about the lives of several people compared to the safety of thousands of people. And the interests of the country are very important? If you are the manager of the country, how do you choose?" The Duke smiled. "The big things in the country are like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa frowned and thought about this impeccable logic and nodded. He believed that the Duke did indeed have nothing to do. Thus his wariness and hostility towards the Duke were completely lifted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke seems to just say it casually: "I think the bishop should not know what happened to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa shook his head. One of the most important problems in the Duke’s heart is that it is no longer a problem. But on the surface, he just nodded slightly and said: "Bishop Ronis is a very kind person, but he has always been uninterested in the military affairs. His intervention is probably a coincidence or a private reason."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nodded. When he saw that the old man who often came to find Shande at night was actually the bishop, it was inexplicable. Sandro only briefly told him about the situation. The bishop immediately ordered the carriage to be pulled into the big house and wait for the duke to come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop did not ask him why the Duke would want him to be removed, and then the mountain is also Druid. They solved this thing for Asa, but they didn't even ask for the reason. Even the most basic curiosity did not express the arbitrariness as if they saw the child fall on the street and lifted it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t understand Asa, I didn’t ask. The bishop is inconvenient to ask him, but he asked him and asked him to explain their indifference just because they didn't care. And this thing that almost made him lose his head, they solved it very casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for the bishop and Sander to intervene is also not clear. But it doesn't matter because he wants to figure it out very clearly and this thing will be solved very skillfully at once. He said: "Fortunately, only I and Klauvis have seen you tomorrow. We only have to claim that the fugitive has seized and executed you. It will be fine." As if looking at Asa very seriously, "As for the stability of the empire in the future." The safety of the people. Just ask you to keep this secret." This hat is very radiant. No young person will like it and once he is put on it will definitely be proud of his protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it was beyond the expectations of the Duke. Asa shook his head but the attitude was clear in the Duke's expectation: "Of course I will keep secrets, but it is not why the people of the country have no interest in the national affairs. I just don't want you and the bishop to be embarrassed and I don't want to die."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there was a slight surprise, the outcome was satisfactory. The duke smiled happily and picked up the glass on the table and said, "Then this thing is over. I am very sorry for the trouble that has been added to you over the past two months. Please forgive me." He smiled even happier. . "And I want to thank you for keeping this secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa also said with a faint smile: "You just do what you should do and I am also doing it." It should be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two clinked together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I have always been grateful to you from my personal point of view." After discussing some confidential details and other things, the Duke took a shot of Asa. The shoulder looked at his eyes and said, "I really thank you for saving my daughter." The tone did not deliberately express the gratitude of a father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa has some guilty questions: "Is the injury of Xiaoyan now better? Where is she now?" These two questions are in his mind. Months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s expression shook his head slightly: “After hurting the cervical vertebra, the journey is bumpy and life is fine, but the hands and feet are always there”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Can I meet her?" Asa couldn't wait to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the little sister saw Asa in the bedroom, the Duke of Mulak had not seen his daughter’s smiling face for a long time. This now makes him a bit stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa walked over to the bed and looked at Xiaoxuan and said, "I'm sorry, I suddenly have something to do. I am not here now?" In the aisle, he and the Duke had already agreed to the caliber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small smugly laughed and said: "Unfortunately, I can't move now. Otherwise, I must cook to make my best dessert for you to taste." She lost a lot of face and was very pale. What is more important for long-term pain and suffering is that she has to face the fact that she can only lie in bed like this. This is not something that anyone can afford. She is still very young and beautiful. There are many future ideals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her body lay calmly in the quilt, as if the bodies covered with cloth on the table of Sander were lifeless. Only the head and neck can move a little to reveal a little lively atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s all my fault." Asa felt as if she had a sour feeling in her eyes. It was him who made her such an Asa recall his inferior and vicious lies. For the first time in his life, he felt that it was heartache. That is the helplessness of helplessness and remorse, and it is clear that it is a mistake that can be avoided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I say this? If I didn't have you, I would have died before I couldn't come home and couldn't see my dad and my sister." Xiao Yan said faintly. It seems to be even stronger. Perhaps it was already too sad during this time that I have accepted this reality. "It’s a pity that the notes in my backpack fell in the swamp. I have the drug information I collected and recorded in the past two years. And unfortunately I haven't found the two herbs you said.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't have me, you won't have anything at all. If it weren't for my trap, you wouldn't hurt it. These words don’t dare to say it makes him feel uncomfortable. Asa saw in Shandru's book that the treatment of magic damage to the brain is basically incurable. It has been played for a long time in Sandro. Asa knows that the spinal cord is actually an extension of the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There must be any way. There must be a way to cure you. You can rest assured." Asa looked at Xiaoxuan. He remembered to teach himself to practice meditation on the book. He once saw a lot of magical anecdotes and strange things recorded in the catalogue and even saw the ridiculous term of "resurrection". Just go back and take a closer look at the book. If you translate the above text, you will definitely have a clue to find a good way to treat it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for comforting me. In fact, as long as you often come to see me chatting with me, I am very happy." Xiao Yan was too weak to smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not comforting you." Asa said with an unusually firm word and a word, "I will find a way to cure you." No matter how long it takes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small look at him in surprise and then slowly turn his head away from the other side of the wall. Asa couldn't see her face and only heard her voice choked. "You don't want to say that. I have decided not to cry anymore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stayed until he left the Duke’s House on the drizzly street. I have been immersed in this great sense of responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke is also very moved to thank him for telling him that he does not have to work hard for this matter. He is very grateful for his heart. After all, this is not his fault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is really my fault. Asa dare not say it. He made up his mind to make up for this mistake. Once he remembered that because of his own timidity and cowardice, he would make a beautiful and gentle woman full of vitality and be completely disabled. He could only die in bed like a corpse. He felt that his heart was like being filled. Into a can of boiling lead juice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must not let this guilt continue to entangle himself. He can’t let himself see the limbs that are moving like a corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he finally saw Xiaoyan’s tears, he was even more shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she finally re-adjusted her voice and turned her breath, Asa saw a face with tears. The face that has been too thin has revealed a brilliance that does not match it. That is the unfortunate satisfaction of the abundance of abundance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can see that it is not a sorrow but another emotion that he does not understand. Although I don't understand it, there is an inexplicable emotion that sprouts in his body and then spreads into every corner of his thoughts in an instant. It seems that an innate string in an unknown corner of the heart has been touched to resonate with her inexplicable feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
