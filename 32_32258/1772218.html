			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking high in the sky, the stretch of the Tulalian forest is like a green ocean. At this height, the huge elves and old trees in the center are also like the majestic mountains that are isolated in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two gargoyles hovering over the top of the elves, a magician sitting on their faces, each with a silver skull mask on their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two magicians dressed up seem to have no surprise except for the silver mask on their faces, but the two masks are enough. That is the legendary devil in the hearts of most people is the most mysterious and most powerful identity and status of the big 6 is the proof of strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the most mysterious and horrible magicians in these two legends are all surprised because they have seen the legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s true that in the eyes of both of them, the momentum of the elves and old trees may be much larger than the ordinary people’s, the vitality and magical power. Even let them feel that their nerves are tightening their body in a burst of magical power that is enough to stand up to the big 6 and resemble a mouse in contrast to this big tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magician began to mutter and smother the mantra, and his hands slammed down two loud explosions from below. The huge flame spreads up with the waves of the explosion and rises up to form a small mushroom cloud of two flames. "Hell Explosion" is not the top attacking magic, but it is not far from this top. In a small-scale battle, such a magical magician can usually turn into a key character in the battle, and this magician actually I used both hands to get out twice at the same time. And actually did not show the slightest effort. If this scene is seen by all the magicians in the world, I am afraid that many people will not dare to study this magic again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the magicians who made these two magics did not appear happy or complacent, but sighed and shook their heads. Because the two hellfires did not really blow to the elves old trees or the layer of the Sierra Forest below, if there was no light shining on the top of the elves. Two high-level magic exploded in midair. This magician used a half-awesome and half-satisfied tone to say: "It seems that this is the ancient war tree of the ancient elf empire era mentioned by the Lord Akidbad in the book. I can't think of the true life of Tula Leone. There is such a tree. The elves are still sinking until this time to use the leaves of the world tree to start it. I never imagined that the leaves of the world tree would be the core of the elves. This kind of effect can withstand our full attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another magician also frowned at the forest below and asked a little bit desperately: "There is still one here." Do you want to combine the fire bombs and the scrolls of an ice storm with the strength of the two of us?" He is not only a little angry, but also has a cover-up fatigue. In fact, he has already cast several great magics just now. But there is no such thing as a glimpse of a colorful light over the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The useless can't break through the life of the enchanted world tree, and it can immediately restore it to its original state. We both The magic power is not enough now..." The magician thought about it and said, "If it is a curse, it should be fine. Or if two people come together to attack the top with a top-level magic, it should work." After all, it’s not an absolute magical failure barrier like the whispering sir...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you want to try it? I don’t think it’s too wasteful to waste the curse scroll. It’s hard work. I’ll go right away and just believe that even the teacher of the world tree will be very interested in it...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a sound from The sound of the ancient trees below is not very loud. But it enveloped the sky above the forest. "The guardians of the dark will or say that I should call the name of your society, the deity of the Necromancer, please go back. We don't want to be against you. But we can't let you take those that they want. Something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Necromancer looked at the sneer out below: "Is the joke really thought that shrinking in this turtle shell will make us back?" I don’t believe they dare to come out from inside.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a green light suddenly shot from the ancient tree of war and pointed to one of the dead spirits. The gargoyle that the mage took. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gargoyle's reaction and mobility are impeccable. With the consciousness of the dead sorcerer above, a little bit of position has been removed between this moment, but only This little bit is obviously not enough for the huge body of the gargoyle. The body of the obsidian is lightly scattered like a glass. The half of the shoulders and arms are swept in green light and turned into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Necromancer I said that we don't want to be enemies with you." The sound once again sounded and the volume did not change, but listening to the ears of the two Necromancers is completely another convincing power. Many times. "But I also promise that we have enough power to dispel the thoughts. Both Mr. Cedrus and Mr. Gru of Oufu can receive news from us immediately. They also have the transport reels of Tula in their hands. Come here at any time. I don't think you want to see them..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These long-eared mice, I will turn you all sooner or later. The meat on the test bench." The necromancer who was almost shot by the green light looked at the bottom of the eye and was full of anger and killing. This very obvious trick has seriously hurt his self-esteem as a Necromancer. A person who thinks he has stood at the top of the world will never like the feeling that others have pulled him down. In particular, he is completely powerless to this threat from others. when. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several winged Pegasus carried the elves around the canopy of the Elven ancient tree. Although he did not dare to fly out of the invisible magical barrier, the elf archers above did not close the bow and arrow in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other Necromancer did not show much excitement and anger. Just a flash of cold light in his eyes and then whispered, "Go."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two gargoyles swayed in the air and turned to the east. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the huge, dense branches of the underlying ancient tree is a platform of intertwined branches. An old, two, and three elves look up at the back of the gargoyle in the sky. The wrinkled elf elders finally breathed a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elder Lloyd, why don't you want me to point to the Necromancer? Why are you killing these evil dark things and why are you going to warn them to leave? "The female elf who carried the huge black longbow asked. Her face was slightly tired and the energy consumed by this arrow was quite a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Lloyd shook his head and sighed and said: "Even if it is aimed at such a long distance, it is not straightforward to kill." It’s killing one with your current strength and it’s impossible to shoot two consecutive arrows and kill the other. These guys are all arrogant, whether they hurt one or make them feel threatened as long as they really irritate them. I am sure that tomorrow will appear on the top. It will definitely not be the magic used by two people. It is definitely not just these conventional magic." He glanced at the face next to his face. "And the power of Luya’s elders is afraid. It’s also the limit. In fact, the two guys above may not be able to take advantage of the bombardment.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf girl who sits at the center of the platform There is no trace of blood in his eyes. In the center of the platform is a magical array of green leaves in the center of the array to slowly spread their green light throughout the array and the girl's hand is lying on the leaf. It is her control to use the power of the leaves of the world tree to cast out the ancient trees of war to support the barrier against the magical bombardment of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slowly opened her eyes and had a blushing face like the silvery face, although it was a sick red blush but it looked on her face instead It seems to have more kind of beauty. Although the vitality of the leaves of the world tree can be endless, she can't. After all, this is the independent control of the war tree's barrier against the magical bombing of the two great magicians. She actually reached the limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several elder elders also walked down from the old trees. All the faces were full of sorrow. Every magical explosion in the sky just made every of the following elves scared. As long as the defense of the old war tree is ineffective, the next thing to face is the disaster. An elder elf wiped the cold sweat on his head and said: "Elder Lloyd seems to be right to open the war tree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Lloyd Shaking his head, the dignity of the face is heavier than all the elder elders. He said: "This is just a matter of expediency. Those guys will not give up. Even if General Cedros and Gru are able to come, they just let them There are scruples. The next time they shoot, it must be an offensive that we can't resist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is any way to deal with them? Tula's There are not so many Pegasus that can be used to ride the archers. These are absolutely against the gargoyles and necromancers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then let Pegasus carry all the magicians."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no way that the Necromancer can never fly into the range of our bows and arrows before using the magic to razed it here. Our tens of thousands of elf archers in Tulao have no use..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every war tree has three eggs that are mutated in war....As long as Luya uses the power of the leaves of the world tree to hatch it, it may give us enough Fighting power against the Necromancers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Queen of Isabel’s whispering smugglers collected these things and established the Tulaolin Forest to stop Let the legacy of the ancient elves be used to kill and provoke war. It is a last resort to use the ancient trees of war..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whether it is the magic of Mafa or The Queen’s intention is that he must never pursue power for disputes and ** and finally bring power out of control.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But the dispute is not what we provoked** The source is that in the hearts of those human beings, do we want to let anyone kill? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument does not seem to produce a result. In the end, all the elder elders turned their attention to Elder Lloyd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Lloyd frowned and looked at the wrinkles on the face of the world tree on the stage. This thing is really a trouble, and the most troublesome part of this trouble is that it cannot be completely solved. After all, this is the sacred object of the elves, and even if it is a great sacrifice, it cannot be handed over to others or destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is necessary to protect the power of one thing. The elves who follow the teachings of Mafa and do not pursue power are undoubtedly not the opponents of the Necromancer. Although it is always possible to get help from Cedros and Gru, this seems to be not a long-term solution. Fortunately, the secret ally Oufu dragged the church and the Necromancer's footsteps to attract most of their attention and power, otherwise the situation will only be more unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that we only have to move...not to find a helper..." Elder Lloyd sighed with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oufu midnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa jumped out of bed and stretched his arms and moved his neck and twisted his muscles. The bones and joints of the whole body were evenly distributed from the cervical vertebrae to the knuckles. The buzzing sound went straight to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" Jessica asked. She leaned all over her body and leaned against the bed. The delicate, delicate skin but full of strength and harmonious beauty made her look more like a black female leopard in the dark than a wake up from the frantic sleep. Prostitute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that something is happening when you put on your clothes." Asa’s words did not finish Jessica and heard a footstep from far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azra opened the door just as the half-orc figure also appeared at the door. The half-orcs did not panic. It seems that this way of opening the door is often just a gasp for Asa: "Mr. Sedros let you go to the city hall as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened? Has the coalition attacked?" Asa asked him not only the footsteps of the half-orcs but also the noise on the streets outside. The orc soldiers’ screams screamed between the sound weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs are still breathing. Even his physique far better than human beings is very difficult to see and is run with extreme speed. His green ugly face is full of sweatlessness, like a soaked bitter gourd, but the excitement and excitement are obvious. "It’s not that the coalition forces withdrew. Mr. Sedros called all the troops to prepare for the attack."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The square in front of the town hall is already a mountain of beasts. Almost all the orcs of Oufu are gathered together. The tall werewolves and ogres carrying huge warhammers and axe-sized lizards also held their own weapons in an orderly and dense manner under the leadership of various tribal leaders and warriors. The Orc Trainer drove ten dragons and hundreds of bulls standing around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this scene like a grand military parade was not too noisy because of the good order, thousands of heavy breathing and wheezings gathered together. Zhilang. The thick breath that permeates the air, from the countless excited orcs, represents the wildness and impulsiveness of their blood, suggesting that this unsettled calm suppresses a storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
