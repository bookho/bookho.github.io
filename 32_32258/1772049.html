			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After discussing with the villagers the situation of the imperial controversy, Rodhart and Asa came to the cabin of the imprisoned and saw the imperial minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Knights of Rod Hart invited you to Ann." As soon as he entered the house, Rod Hart was half-squatting, and the knight’s courtesy tone was also a slap in the face. Singing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial minister is a middle-aged man with a white skin and a neat and tidy appearance. This kind of person, Asa, is common in the night of Wangdu. Usually, a woman or a man is sometimes taken up and down the luxury carriage to enter and exit the brightly-built courtyard. Such people usually have a feature that even if the hands and feet are placed on the woman, the expression is usually the integrity of a national official. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the imperial minister is even more devout. He was kneeling in the middle of the hut with his eyes closed. It seems that this captive identity does not make him panic. The clothes are still neat and solemn and solemn and seem to be within the luxurious cathedral. He did not respond to Rod Hart's words and still focused on prayer. And Rod Hart is still there. Asa stood at the door and looked at them inexplicably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final imperial minister slowly opened his eyes and seemed to be praying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are here to save you from going out." Rodhart still groaned. He has been completely impressed by the adult's temperament. Being trapped in such an environment can still be so calm and praying so devoutly that the belief in his heart is how firm the volume is. It is indeed the demeanor that a big man should have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know." The imperial minister looked at Rodehart with a compassionate look like a master of prophecy he had mastered. "As a servant of God, I have always believed that I will not be hurt by those low-lying gangsters. God will surely come to save those who believe in him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He got up and walked over to help Rodhart: "This knight is here by God's guidance. You must be a person with an infinite sense of justice and a person who is very religious to God?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt nodded quickly: "Yes. I am ready to dedicate my life to light and justice."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is the situation outside? Have the gangsters been cleaned up by you?" The imperial minister looked at him with a glance at the hero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things are like this". The attention of the imperial minister is very excited and so embarrassing. "Those are not gangsters, they are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Rod Hart’s statement, the imperial minister had some surprises, but after thinking about it, his face quickly settled down. Nod and said: "Well, everything about what you said will be investigated and dealt with after I return to the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you. You are The eyes of ordinary people are as noble as the messengers of God.” Rodhart was so grateful that he almost cried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is natural." The imperial minister nodded gracefully to the acclaim of this accolade. "As a servant of His Majesty the Immaculate God, I naturally want to do my best to preside over justice. During the inspections, I have never been merciless to the pagan gods and the gangsters who disturbed the Empire. But if there is Devoted believers and law-abiding citizens are wronged and I must give them justice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are so great." Rodhart felt it I have my own idol. "I will escort you back to the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial minister nodded as if he agreed to someone else’s request. Rodhart immediately bent down and sent him away from the cabin where he was being held. From the beginning to the end, the imperial minister has not seen Asa at the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside of the house saw the imperial minister coming out. All the villagers came together and gave the imperial minister a half sigh. This is what Rod Hart strongly suggested to think that he can go home safely and continue to live. The villagers are also particularly respectful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial minister used a very responsive posture and momentum to nod his head and take it for granted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the villagers stood together and watched Rod Hart and the imperial ministers go away and think of the gift of the gift. Perhaps their wish is promising and they are all a little excited. I also think that this imperial minister is probably really a good person who has studied a lot of knowledge and probably has a very kind heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing is completely inexplicable from the beginning to the end for Asa. But fortunately things have been solved and now there are people who are familiar with this forest. He first found the hunter Levin. He should be the one who is most familiar with the forest. However, after listening to his problems, the hunter Levin shook his head in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa almost desperate. A futile anger was born in his heart. If Cris is now in front of him, he must have both her eyes brutally bruised and then swearing at her. You don’t understand it, and you don’t know how to make it clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key is that she still holds the book and follows the caravan designated by his father. I don’t know where to go. I don’t even want to go back and find someone to translate. I thought that I was frightened by the ten silver coins and I couldn’t help but regret it. If you are not so anxious at the time and then check it out in the library, there may be some clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greed for money is evil. He remembered a grumble that an old pastor in his hometown often hangs on his lips. He is a little weird now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only one forest in the forest where you don't have anything to say." A voice that didn't hear much clearly said that Asa turned to look at it. That claimed that he had never seen a fair old man in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man has a few teeth whose mouth is leaking: "There is a forest in the depths of the forest that is going back to the forest. People look back and have nothing to look back." The forest that speaks..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunter Levin seems to have been reminded to nod and say: "I remember that there is a strange forest with no beasts. I ran inside, so I didn't go in. But recently, it seems that there are often soldiers in the city who take the grass outside the forest as a grave. I sometimes see them burying the body there."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of forest is that?" Asa felt as if it was a bit of a clue. "Why did you want to go back when you looked? Why didn't I hear about it when I was in the city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunter Levin shook his head and said: "The forest gives people a feeling Not very comfortable, the locals don't like to be close. And the forest feels like "He frowns very hard to search for the appropriate metaphor in his brain. The result is that the head is still horizontal and still can't find the right decoration. "Like what is strange, I don't want to think about it." He suddenly cheered up. "Yes, it's like a very annoying person. You can't even think about it. So you don't even want to think about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa frowned and repeated him The words: "Like a nasty person? Don't think about it?" This metaphor for the forest is hard to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"En feeling is that" Hunter Levin frowned and thought about refining a metaphor in his poor words. Asa feared that the more he said the more difficult it was to say, "It doesn't matter what it is, please take me to see you tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" "There are children outside shouting." The villagers ran out to hear the results he brought back from the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt was surrounded by people who saw the victory of the game between the villages and ran back to report the children’s face and couldn’t wait to say loudly to everyone. "The admiral has said that we will gather all the people to the grass on the east side of the forest at noon tomorrow. He will join the local officials to announce in public that they will be excused from their actions and will be exempt from our taxes."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd burst into cheers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said that this is fair in the world? Do you believe it?" Rod Hart looked around and proudly proclaimed his beliefs. Everyone in victory is immersed in their own joy and no one cares what he says. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the old man who spoke to Asa was not very happy and he also listened to Rod Hart’s words very clearly. He shook his head as if to talk to himself: "I haven't seen anything like this when I was seventy years old." Turned around and stressed to Asa: "Seventy years old." Asa nodded quickly . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
