			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it was only temporarily remodeled in the basement, the Academy of Magic’s ability to build this temporary cell was very solid. Needless to say, the steel bars with thick arms are not likely to be broken by three people, even three elephants. And dozens of magicians and priests in the steel fence and the walls of the entire cell temporarily engraved dozens of magical arrays also make this cell more solid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa was unable to sit on the ground. It’s not that he doesn’t have the spirit if his eyes can really be solid. The cardinal has long been poked. But the only thing he can do now is to look at it with his eyes. The injury on his joints is not heavy, but it is just enough for him to move. The sorcerer's magical array of magicians painting inside and outside the prison even has a small seal array. Needless to say, he is afraid that even if Cedros is trapped inside, there is no way to use magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want to do?" Asa looked at the cardinal outside. His face still carries the usual masks. Javey and Rhodehart have not exposed his true identity. It is only to others that this is a very important prisoner who needs to be held in separate trials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure that I won't do anything to you. But just after asking you a few questions, I will send you to Celeste. The Pope will seem to want to see you. See you. Although I don't know what he wants to see you do, I am at least sure that it will not be for you. Maybe he is interested in the leaves of the world tree and the sun well in your body."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can you go to Deva Valley to become a member of the Necromancer Association? I know that you did not have any relationship with Deva Valley before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not something you worry about. In fact, you didn't have the opportunity to go in like me at the time? But you gave up and the result was that Vadeneina was shut down. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You were the apprentice of Vedina? But when did she accept you as a disciple? According to time, that should be..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal laughs and does not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing here now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come back here?" Jia Wei gently A smile. "Of course it is to get my things back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red The cardinal nodded: "Yes. It should have belonged to my status power... Of course there are people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People?" Asa’s eyes burst into vain The light is like a beast. His snoring also becomes like a wolf roaring: "I warn you not to touch her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javier has no provocation The rebuttal just frowned and frowned and said, "Don't touch her? She seems to be my wife. This sentence is actually what I said to you more than a year ago..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In short...in short..." Asa was so excited that she even twitched her face and suddenly stood up from the ground. But the pain and weakness of the joints made him fall down immediately. He still squatted on the ground: "I tell you that if you touch her, I will definitely make you regret for a lifetime..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javier still looks very dull Just nodded. With some comforting tone, it is like talking to himself and saying to Asa whispered: "I can finally be completely sure. I have won. I won if the battle is strategy or emotional." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa struggled half-sitting on the ground and said, "You have the ability to kill me now. Otherwise you will never win."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I have already won." Jarvi nodded calmly, affirming that this calm would only occur in the face of undisputed results. "Do you think I will use any despicable means to get her? No, I will tell you. I will go to pursue her with a bright and honest attitude. I don't want her to be a local. But she wants her heart and her feelings. And I can be successful." I tell you that I won you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that I still like you in her mind. But in reality, she still has to face boring every day. The boring state affairs of the boundless government. At this time, do you say that she needs to be able to accompany her around her to solve her worries and live with her, or is it a shadow that only exists in her memory and does not dare to see her?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can win controversy. Do you still don't understand where you lost yourself? You lost yourself and you lost this person. I don't know if you heard this sentence from me. I am also given you the loss of character."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter how good the chance is, even the luck you are in front of you is not sure. But You are not the kind of coward who is completely incompetent everywhere. You refused to reject the Duke’s adult rejection of Bishop Ronis. The teacher refused to have the strength but not to exercise and use it because you not only have no secular ** but also Refused to this worldly world. You may think that those of us who are driven by ** are ugly and boring, are you? You want to keep your free and free life posture? But you are inevitably involved in this situation. How do you refuse in the storm? Your attitude is no longer a refusal to escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I sent someone to listen after seeing your weapon in her The news knows that the thing is actually as a The token was sent to you there and I have been monitoring the Prime Minister’s office. Now you have not recovered the weapon. I know that you are afraid to face her. At this time, I also vaguely felt that you are What kind of mentality, and finally seeing your anger here, I know that I really won. I am willing to rely on my instinct and personality to simply live and even the facts to escape. Why do you win me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Jia Wei has been saying. Asa is always listening to it. He knows that these are true facts. Every word that appeared in Jia Wei’s mouth slammed into his heart and made a loud noise. "Now I still have some loss. A guy like you will actually be the biggest enemy I have ever had. But it was so easy to be defeated by me." Bishop Jia Wei sighed and then looked at the smile with a smug look: By the way, I told you The reason why I don't reveal your identity. Also because I don't want to alarm her. I will use a variety of methods to let her slowly forget you. Finally I will let her become my wife again. This time is really true. All that belongs to me will belong to me. You don't have to be reconciled because you don't deserve it. "<c /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Cough' Asa’s body trembled. He bent over and coughed up a blood. The expression on his face has completely lost control and the body is also shaking. Javi looked at the ground and snorted and smirked at Asa. He knew that this helpless failure and sorrow was the most desperate and painful. Then he Raise the voice and shout: "Bring people in. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Javier’s voice, Rhode Hart came in with the bundled Jessica. Everything here is confidential so it’s not suitable for others. His men are involved.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt is still so calm. Jessica is a sneer and disdain to watch Asa sneer and say: "Your This friend is really trustworthy. "Javi took the black elf and threw it on the ground and stepped on her face. Jessica screamed but there was no resistance." .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay. The chat time between the two of us has ended. It’s time to start working now. I asked you that there should be a secret place in the School of Magic... Maybe it is a prison cell, etc. Do you know where it is? "Javi asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not answer that he was still lying on the ground and curled up into a group of expressions and the body was distorted by mental torture.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that it is very difficult for you to answer questions at this time, but I am very anxious to know this answer. This was originally supposed to be known only to the Bishop of Ronis. The most known thing about you now is you. Bishop Jia Wei reached out and squeezed the finger of the black elf's finger slowly. Jessica snorted but did not call it out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tiny sound of a crispy pea was crushed by the black elf. The slender and long fingertips in the hands of Bishop Javey became a pile of fuzzy flesh-and-blood skeletons piercing the skin and muscles in a messy shape. Sika just snorted and twitched and didn't scream.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good bones. Bishop Jia Wei faintly smiled and played the blood on his finger. "But I advise you to call it out to your lover." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica's face is full of cold sweat but she is still sneer: "This is what a young man." When you fall into my hands one day, I promise you to see the art of the black elf's torture art. The first thing is to spend half a day slowly cutting your work. I told you in advance that the scene was absolutely wonderful. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
