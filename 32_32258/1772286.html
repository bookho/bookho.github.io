			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis’s face became ugly, but Abin’s face was even more ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I can give you a chance. You take her down and let me see your determination to be useful to me."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the most seasoned judges and heretical judges, there is no such thing as a cool and majestic Knight. His eyes are still very sturdy, but the power is no less than the sickle on the huge guillotine. Abin's face was even more ugly, and the facial features were completely twitched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will judge it myself. I will count it, you will have no chance if you don't do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The female knight on the ground yelled: "Tamik, can you be a Knight of the Temple? Is it also worthy of the Lord's glory in the Glorious Castle? If the Pope knows that you will do this. Punish you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamik Knight did not look at Talis, only staring at Abin’s mouth and pronounced: “One.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin is not only convulsed on his face, but his body has also begun to twitch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two, three..." The Tamik Knight is not slow, he is not the kind of person who deliberately loses his appetite and shows his superiority. This rhythm just makes people feel urgent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin’s body is still shaking, the bean's sweat is rolling from the forehead and sinking on the chin, the hand holding the sword. Because of excessive exertion and whiteness, it seems that I will smash it at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four..." The Tamik Knight has lifted the knife. Until this time his face was not murderous, although everyone knows that he will never make a joke. Talis has not said anything, she only feels desperate and horrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin suddenly screamed with a dying beast-like cockroach, his expression has been completely replaced by an animal's cockroach, not seen the person completely I can't imagine such a handsome and clever teenager can make such a beastly move. He suddenly raised his sword and fell to the neck of Talis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jianguang is like a practice, the air that is drawn is like a beast. But after a local bang, Abin’s sword was smashed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tamik Knight retracted the knife. He looked at both Abin and Talis, and it was the expression of the wood. It seems to be thinking again. Finally he seemed to understand again, watching Abin nod. "Well, maybe it's really useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin slammed softly on the ground and gasped with a big mouth. It seems that I have just had a long run of hundreds of miles, and I feel so tired that I am completely free from the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis is completely staying, stunned, not just because she just came back from the ghost gate, more because of the sword Actually it is Abin. He knew that Abin’s sword was not fake. She felt the murderousness. If it wasn’t for the Tamik Knights to stop, she would really be cut off by this sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If such a sword is cut from the sum of others, she will not be so surprised and unbelievable, but from Abin, she is completely unable to accept. It would be forgiven if she said that she had stabbed her from the side. If you want to save the lives of two people, then such a sword is completely <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no room for resolution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you talk about the word 'friends', the most direct conversion from Talis is Abbott. I have been training in Celeste from an early age,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After adulthood, I have been living in the glory of the Knights of the Temple, and the surrounding priest is not a dumb priest. knight. In the ordinary people <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly hard and stereotyped life even a suitable conversational communication object. Until he met him in Elazia, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there was a concept in her mind that the word 'friend' should have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation suddenly changed suddenly, and he completely lost his sight. When I suddenly met him again in this forest, and still mixed like this <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexplained, the heart of the Tali line has long been He was the only friend who was temporarily. But it was this true friend who just chopped her head with a sword and a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, you have proved that you are a person who knows the interests and knows the affairs. I have reasons to stay with you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamik looked at Abin and nodded, then gestured to the two Templars. The Templar immediately found a <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tree vine from the tree next to it. Ma De tied up Talis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You two gits, beasts... The heart has been eroded by the devil and is more dirty than the Necromancer. You are not worthy of using the White Devil..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis woke up from shock and anger, and began to scream again. However, it is somewhat different from the previous explosive tone. This time it seems hysterical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A templar grabbed a bunch of leaves and weeds into the mouth of the knight. Block her shouts inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just like this ‘useful’? After being pushed out, I heard the dialogue between the Tamika Knight and Asa. The Tali line only felt that it was completely empty in her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden shot of the Tamik Knight, who thought it was a sudden betrayal of the ignorance of his hometown, had already made her mind a mess, not willing to Left and right in the mind seems to have a burst of the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she also knows from her standpoint that it is ridiculous to threaten Asa with herself, and Asa seems to have no reason, but she When I saw Asa even, I didn’t seem to look at her, and I didn’t even look at it. When I smiled indifferently, I had already stopped thinking about it and it was empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companion? Who is a companion? Is there a companion? Who is right here? Who is right? Is there justice? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the Tamick Knight had a black fangs knife, she almost did not feel the fear. She only felt that the face was cold, and then the knife cut into the sound of the meat, and the strong bloody smell came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly stunned, she suddenly found out that she had nothing in her body. Then, after a little return to God, she knew the knife and <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not cut it on her own body, just wiped it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamik Knight will not cut, can not kill a person who can not move, this is almost equal to a person to eat, accidentally not put their hands and arms It’s incredible to eat together. Talis did not understand what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then everything that happened next made her less aware of it, and she didn’t have time to understand it. The whole world exploded suddenly in a way that could not be understood under the knife that the Tamik Knight did not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explosive sound, flame burning sound, cracking sound, bone break, sound knife, sword, screaming, screaming almost all in the same time, all over the place Blood, limbs, violent magic elements, like jumping from the silent forest to the battlefield of the vinegar fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis has just returned to discover that the Tamek Knight is retreating, the black fangs long knife with a bloody stain, the other side of the blood Connected with a hand flying in the air. It wasn't her hand, and she was being held back by a person holding a fly and retreating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one more step back, Talis discovered that the person holding her retreat was Abin, his sword-bearing hand had been cut off shoulder-to-shoulder. . The long sword he had in his hand was inserted in the waist of the Tamik Knight. Although it doesn't look deep, it has become the reason why the Tamik Knights have to take a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The templar who had been holding a long sword next to Yabin has disappeared, accurately flying out, being a black knife Nail a nail on a big tree without a scarecrow. There was also a scream of screaming out of his throat. The sword in his hand also has blood, but Talis knows that it is not her own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
