			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Mei is working with the magicians of the three shining castles. Her body is surrounded by a transparent water curtain, although it seems to be weak, but the three magicians' fireballs and lightning strikes on it, but the religious rituals can't break through this shield and she waved cold. The ice god arrow blasted the head of a magician into a piece of crushed ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elemental magic of the Tower of the Tooth is still the pure and fierce of those who are the pro-disciples of the Water Magic Master. Her magic is far from the equivalent of the ordinary magician. The two magicians underneath did not have the slightest fighting spirit to escape with the flow of people around the crowd of swordsmen. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Meimei waved a gesture in the water curtain; screaming at the inability to sway and then waved the grand elements unique to the high-level spells to the escaped magician. Out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scream rang out of the water in the air around the magician, instantly condensed into a huge circle of ice thorns. The shaping of the ring is not hindered by the **, but because of the more moisture in the body, it condenses bigger and faster. Immediately after the formation of the ice ring, more than a dozen swordsmen around the magician also smashed with flesh and blood. The two magicians in the center were not injured, but they were still in shock. In fact, another piece of cold condensed into a huge ice thorn on the top of their head and smashed their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai Meimei, who has been out of magic, did not stop at instinct. She immediately noticed the strongest and most vital person around Asa. She immediately turned to look at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She Hu Ben is white and delicate, the girl’s skin is now whiter and more transparent, so that she can see all the muscle fibers and bones in the body. The blood is taken away by the Soul Eater along with the vitality, but it does not dry up and has something more powerful to support in the **. Turned around and stared at Asa. In the eyelids, it is no longer that the big watery spirit's eyes are the fire of two groups of burning dead souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This smart and sultry little girl is now a corpse. Dozens of ugly and horrible zombies and medullas clustered her in the middle of the fairness. She looked like a flower of a dead in a carrion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is only a teenager and can be said to be just a little girl. In order to save Asa. She is a man and two necromancer traders holding the mortal consciousness to go around and sway around. Even the most experienced warrior is the most daring to listen to the adventurous, and she does not have the ability to go to the ground but she does. The war of this glorious castle can be said to be caused by her efforts. In the end, in the surging enemy stream, no one even noticed how she was killed by the magic of the ha, and the silence was silent and ignorant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s painful heartache turned out to be a numbness. I didn’t even notice that the ice and water vapor condensed on top of my head until the cold spread to my face. Turning all the liquid in the body into a spike, the flesh is smashed and smashed, and when he spreads his eyes to the head, he instinctively reacts to the hood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slamming sound. The vindictively bounced the ice on his face with the coldness of the surrounding field and flew out his small half of his skin. Finally, the cold did not cover the eyes, and the eyes did not fly together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ayi Mei’s gestures even smashed into the ice thorns that appeared in Asa’s body around him. The body of the corpse is indeed more suitable than the human body to magically flow the condensed atmosphere of the black star. The cold will give all the undead creatures infinite power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow of people around the escape did not stop and no one noticed the battle here. But it was only an inconspicuous little battle of the entire battlefield. The people who had been escaped were drawn. The end. All the orcs and people are dying to escape the growing number of undead monsters who are constantly swallowing them to tear them apart and then endless darkness to turn them into undead. There are screams everywhere. The explosions are all flesh and blood flying and bones and carrion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hiding two or three times, Asa no longer hides because he knows that there is no meaning to hide again. He took the pain that has already been numb. A huge, hot fireball writhed in his hand and rushed toward Ayimei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Meimei’s fresh ice god corruption was swallowed silently in front of the fireball, and the fire was so strong that it could easily resist the magic of others. In the face of this fire, the curtain can only show the same fragility as the surface and the zombies and guards around Aiyimei are blown up and swallowed by flames. Although the spell is rough, but in the pure magical destructive power, Asa is not the same as ordinary magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of a pain in the hands of Asa's magical power is about to rush out suddenly a big drink with a fierce wind breaking from the side. "Stop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa flashed over the side of the sword. It seems that a team of swordsmen and pastors are not far from Talis. I am running towards here. It seems that she led the team after the break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" Talis screamed at Asa, but the voice just fell on an ice arrow and hit her chest, though she could not pass through the glory. A also frozen her to the ice and fell to the ground. When she looked back at the fire of the dead spirit that Ai Meimei was burning, she understood what was going on. Her eyes were full of horror and muttered: "How could this be?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa did not argue with her and then rose to Ai Mei. In addition to those top-level old monsters, no matter whether it is a corpse or a magician, as long as there is no near-negative guard, it is similar to a target for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait. You stop." The long sword in the hands of Talis blocked Asa and rushed up to drag him. Her voice and expression have been religious rituals. She is even sceptical. She even wonders if she is crazy. "How can this be? How can you do this? You must have a way to think about it. There must be a way.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out of the way. Saqiang resisted a punch and beat Talis's head violently and kicked open. Ai Mei's huge ice swept the scalp of both of them.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have prevented him from saving the little girl. Talis shouted at the swordsmen and pastors who followed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the swordsmen also saw the flame in the eyes of the little girl. At least half of their companions are falling under the sorcerer's transformation of this magician. In this case, even the loyal subordinates may not execute the order of a monster who will save the next undead. Moreover, they also know that it is not the opponent of that person.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Talis, you are awake, the little girl is dead. It’s just that the monster transformed by the corpse is no longer a human being, and it’s impossible to save it. "2 Swordsmen are not benzene to see the reason for the loss of the Talis Knight." We are still running away. This direction can only be done after the break. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground is shaking. A huge skeleton monster rumbling and rushing over the last swordsman’s team never slammed Come here. This is a monster that resembles a crocodile but is several times bigger than a dragon. The swordsman who swears every time under the foot of the skeleton. The screaming screaming of the flesh and blood is as unrelenting as the ants.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Mei suddenly turned to look at the huge spear in Zhuangxiang’s eyes and the fire of the dead spirit. The Gantu Dudu suddenly had a dead eye in the eye. The fire was also a flash, and the other swordsmen and priests left at the foot stepped forward. Although there was no sound, it had a strong connection with Ai Mei.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not care. He rushed to Ai Mei.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ai Mei is here for you. save you. She became like this because of you... I beg you to save her. "Talis's voice has been strong and crying. I don't know why she has not dared to go forward.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think I don't know? You thought I didn't Sad?" Asa jerked his head and turned to Talis to snarl his voice until half of it was dumb. The vocal cords were torn because of too much force. Although he could not see his own eyes, he knew that it must be red. I have to drip blood to get her blood to be burned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning to the chill of Ai Mei, Asa did not dodge but blocked by hand while One hand was placed on Ai Mei's forehead. The feeling of the delicate but cold skin started and the huge ice thorns suddenly formed in the arm and then broke the pain of the spurs and the knots were difficult to separate and then The torrent-like fire magical force surged out of Ai Meimei's petite body and turned into ashes in the fire.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa and Talis did not move any more. I didn’t talk anymore, just looking at the dust that had disappeared and landed. It’s just that the eyes of the two are different. The sorrow of the eternal sorrow in the bottom of my heart is the sorrowful sorrow in desperation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no more sadness and no more irreparable Recoverable. The world does not change what has already happened because of anyone's sadness, so the only thing that can be done is what can be done.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
