			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all the processes are carried out in a state where Rod Hart is sober and feels very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and this seemingly non-like old man seems to have an infinite amount of interest in this kind of work. Rest only for a small period of time every day, and then put time and energy on his body in addition to eating. He never thought that he would actually become such a step. He thought about death and was not afraid of death, but he did not expect that he would fall into life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is better than death? Rhodes Hart finally understood, the word is almost for him to do for his current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day, fortunately, the Queen died and pleaded, he was not killed by the angry Roland head, just exiled him, and said that he would never be allowed. Then the king appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman is really weird, very weak animal. When he saw that the Queen had to kneel down to the head of Roland to ask him to let go of himself, Rhode Hart thought so. She has betrayed her to do this, and she is still desperate to help herself. But it is also true that women are indeed such strange animals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Paladin's squad leader, to the exiled one with nothing, this failure is a complete failure. But he was not discouraged, not even depressed, but it even inspired the fighting spirit. Instead of wandering around in obscurity or being in seclusion, it is better to desperate for your own dreams and die in the path of your own dreams. Already lost a lot, the only way is to get more, otherwise he would rather die. He can't accept such a big failure, he can only turn this failure into another, greater chance of success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This opportunity is to go to Diya Valley and rely on Jarvis’s father Marquis. He knows some of the inner feelings of Diya Valley from Jarvis's mouth. Javy originally intended to use him as his right hand. These news are also a means to convince him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is convinced that such a useful person can be appreciated by the Marquis. Must be accepted by the Marquis. And he still has a message that he probably knows only himself. He guessed the Necromancers must be very interested in this news. The news is also a kind of capital, so he has been well preserved and has not told anyone. He used the power of one person to play the mountain range. He knew that it was almost synonymous with madness. But he only has to do that. He wants to fly higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was saved by a Necromancer while he was dying. The Necromancer dressed by the Cardinal not only treated his dying injury, but also took him to Celeste to meet the Marquis. At this time he already thought that he would fly soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the Marquis quietly listened to his words, he just nodded and then fixed his body. "Thank you for telling me about those things. I know that you are a very useful person, but I also know that you are going to use it for me, but it is because I am also useful to you. And I know that you will never just be willing to use me. Your usefulness is, after all, useful to yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A person who can never be satisfied can't control it. It can't be controlled, it's useless." "The Marquis said faintly after saying such a sentence, he stopped looking at him and said to the cardinal who sent him." "This kind of useful person is still sent to the teacher of Shante. He is not saying that a test article is not enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, this is actually my original Meaning." The cardinal smiled. "Being alone can go deep into the Shadow Mountain Range. Physical fitness and willpower are the top choices. Teacher Shante said that it is such a useful person.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp I took him here to see how he said to you, but I can't think of getting such a message. "The news that is useless for the time being, hope is only temporary, or if this person really does not have anything to me. Used." The Marquis replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fail to fly, fall to death on the road to fly. But what he didn't expect was that the flight didn't fly, and even fell and fell, and he couldn't die if he wanted to die. How could this be? How can I do this? How can I become like this? I don't know how long it has been sent to this strange hut, maybe not long after, maybe it's been a lifetime. In addition to the constant and severe pain, there is only such a thought in Rhodesart’s mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sour voice came, the pain from the arm can be crazy, but he is crazy. Don't look at it, Rhodes will know that the old man is engraving the magic array on his arm. Almost all of this large bones have been engraved with this kind of thing. The magical power in your body is also tangled with the snoring. This person actually has some magic, the magic qualification is quite good, rare rare, good, good. This is the admiration of the old man named Shante when he opened his arm for the first time. Therefore. His special training in the engraving of the magical array, especially in the engraving, seems to instill some magical power into it from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are guests? It's rare...." The old man turned and made a gesture. "You can pack it yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the action of the old man, the body of Rhodes has not been moved for a long time and the body has slammed. He jumped from the stone platform, packed his arm that had been taken apart and stood on the corner. Standing next to it is the whole body muscle, like the same muscle fortress. Rodhart pulled a large piece of dirty cloth on the ground and covered himself and the same kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His movements are very smooth and fast, and these are all out of his own will, he only feels his own brain, he did it himself . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be the role of the magical array engraved in his skull. Rhode Hart remembers that this old man was particularly careful when he engraved this magical array. He seemed to have dropped a drop of blood in his mind. He could also feel that the old man's blood was very sticky and thick. Like a thick mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he just remembers, since the blood of the earth has dropped into the magic circle, he has almost no thinking ability. In most of the time, he can listen, see, move, feel, and can't think. Only very few occasional opportunities, such as now, he can vaguely think about it, recall, regret it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------------------<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still a cemetery in this place? Is there still someone living?" Talis said with amazement. After a few days of flight, they have already arrived at the borders of Nigen. Now standing in front of a deserted cemetery. Speaking of Nigan, the first thing that everyone thinks of is the huge underground world. There is a huge hollow in the crust of the west side of the continent. Compared with the world of the earth, the bottom is like a completely different outer boundary. Tauren, black elf, eagle banshee... Countless creatures form a self-contained world below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This caused the wars of the creatures and the surface humans that crouched in the underground to originate when it was impossible to study. The war had already slammed the surface of Nigan in countless times. . Although it is not a poor mountain water like the Dragon Desert, it is also not suitable for people to live in. There are usually only a group of big eared monsters and some eagle owls wandering on the ground. Although the location of this cemetery is considered to be very remote in Nigen, there is no community of big ear monsters on the way, but it is really weird to be inhabited in such a place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the cemetery, but it seems to be just a pile of chaotic burials. There is a fence around it. In the center of the cemetery, there is a room that looks like the grave and the grave. This place is actually inhabited, indeed, "Is there Mr. Shante old? I came to visit under the guidance of Egrenair." Asa did not directly enter the cemetery, just stood outside and asked aloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come in." A faint voice came out of the room with a cough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And is the Necromancer?" Talis's eyes swept over the surrounding graves and touched Asa with caution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are things buried in these cemeteries....It seems to have fluctuations in the magic of the dead. It is better to be careful."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elites who are qualified to be buried here are the throne of the Temple, and the corpses of the eight bishops are your predecessors. You should believe that they will not be messy. Attacking you is." The coughing sounds and pieces together, coming out of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis is still far from the hut, her voice is not big, but the people in the room don’t seem to hear it, but she also heard that she is the church. People. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa made a calm gesture to Talis, since Aier’s mother-in-law asked him to come here, this should not be an enemy. Three walked into the cemetery and came to the door of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A squatting old man opened the door, wretched like a bat, or an old bat, stiff. The action, constantly coughing, no one would doubt that this is an old man who can fall down at any time. He looked at the three eyes with a weak look, and the turbid eyes stayed a little more on Asa's body, raising his hand and saying, "Come in and sit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entering this tomb-like room, Asa’s first feeling was somewhat intimate. Talis still kept the look and momentum of this kind of alert, Ai Meimei was screaming, almost scared to turn around and escape, shrinking behind Talis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
