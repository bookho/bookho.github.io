			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well?" Lancelot walked a glimpse. The volatility of the imaginary magic of Tima High Priest came at this time. Stoic knew that there was already a hand, so he urged Lancelot to say: "It is the high priest, we are fast. Point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No..." Lancelot's expression was a bit odd. "Who did you hear any strange noises?" "Weird voice?" Stowe also groaned and shook the huge bull's head. "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Lancelot didn’t ask him, he asked the other six Knights of the Temple. However, the six knights looked at each other and shook their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems like someone is screaming, is a woman....." Lancelot's expression is still very weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the Paladin, the expressions of other Knights of the Temple are also weird. This does not seem to be suitable for the questions asked in this environment at this time. The key is that this person who asks questions seems to be very unsuitable for this problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot frowned and shook his head in confusion. He did hear the scream of a woman who did not know where it came from, and it seemed to be the voice of someone who knew, as if...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is almost impossible for a person like him to have an illusion in perception to make mistakes, but if his hearing feels that the judgment is not wrong, it seems theoretically even more impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go to the business that the priest of Tima has commanded. After you've finished, you have to have more women. Those black elves have heard about humans for you." It is a very good woman. You don't have to worry, there will be a lot of land." Stoic was very impatient and still annoyed. If you don't know that you don't <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be an opponent, he prefers to use fists or axes to communicate with these humans. But now you can only use this as much as possible to communicate in a way that they can understand. Lancelot nodded a little helplessly and didn't have an explanation. This is really not the time and occasion for worrying about these things. He continued to walk towards the front. "You can rest assured that this is the only way for the Black Elf Holy Land to go to Othello. We will not miss it anyway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stoge with Tauren The unique throat sound promised. Then turned and slammed the other Tauren's language with the Tauren. The breathing of the Tauren people is much heavier, and all the wide passages seem to be filled with the smell of the Tauren breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, all the Tauren breathe heavily after entering this huge passage. They are very nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are fifty Tauren elite warriors and ten Tauren priests, all of whom are elites. Especially the fifty Tauren warriors headed by Stoic, they are no longer ordinary tomahawks, but huge pure steel tomahawks with magical inscriptions. All these axes are all engraved with the Sword of the Sword, which is a special weapon prepared by the Tamar High Priest for many years. That huge weight matches the strength and strength of the Tauren, and this weapon seems to be more suitable for cutting the gates without enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the elite Tauren warrior’s own combat power is not to be underestimated, even if the combat power is not as good as the seven Knights of the Temple, but they are both powerful and destructive. It is an absolute victory. Even a rhinoceros has no chance of winning with these Tauren warriors. Besides the years of combat experience, they will never just wrestle with their opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if such an elite warrior holds such a weapon and walks in a tunnel that is not as wide as a tunnel, they can’t help but be nervous. The ten Tauren priests seemed to be better, whispering something that seemed to be the verses of the sects, and asked the legendary gods of their ancestors to give them the power and courage to face the enemy. In the face of the enemy who has never met, only in the legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tunnel is quite different from Nigan, not only very wide, but also well-prepared, more like a huge passage for a mansion. In the channel, unlike other parts of Nigan, there are only a few occasionally visible illuminating crystals that illuminate the walls, and artificially inlaid with many gems that can shine. Although the brightness is not whiter than the ground, it can be said that it is brilliant in this underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This passage leads to the holy places of the black elves, their spokespersons of the gods, the residence of the Black Dragon Molier. The black elves have worshipped this huge intelligent creature as a half god, and it has always helped the black elves to occupy the highest and highest position in this underground world. To destroy or completely defeat the black elves. This spokesperson of the gods must be eradicated. This is something that everyone in Nigan knows. But everyone knows that to get rid of this dragon should only be the dragon that appeared in the legend, which is what the residents of Nigan want to think. If you die, you can’t do it because you can’t do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
