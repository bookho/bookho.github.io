			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bang of Lancelot’s body smashed the front of the orc and smashed the magical shield that the Cardinals tried to support until they slammed into the distance. At the head of a bull who was rushing toward the swordsman, the whole man was sunken into the body of a bull. He carried a few thousand pounds of bulls and flew for more than ten meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bull is dead. Lancelot stood up with blood and he spurted another blood. That is not the blood of the cow is his blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew that he was dead at least five times if it wasn’t the glory armor that attracted the healing power of Purdue. The strength of that foot is far beyond his expectation and the ability to withstand the glory of the armor. The armor in the air is constantly destroying and then being repaired by the Purdue beings, where the chest and abdomen are constantly broken and constantly cured. After consuming the Purdue beings, it basically offset the destructive power of this foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe even the humanoid Morrill can't play such a kick. This foot has almost all the limits of the power that can be achieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now my status is the best." Gruyal pointed to Lancelot and they are now separated by hundreds of meters of Gru and Not big, but Lancelot heard it clearly because he was talking to him and he was listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru's wounds are still in the blood of the Temple of the Knights before the death of the two swords deep to the bones, he and the orcs can not borrow the treatment of Purdue beings The power has also consumed too much power. Lancelot can be sure that he must be very heavy. But I also feel it. Maybe his state is really the best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**It’s really in the spirit of weakness, but it’s already condensed to an unprecedented height. It’s like a huge wave, it’s like killing and killing, killing and killing. No more. Even the two enthusiasm that has reached the extreme is not replaced by a more wonderful and deeper soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru pointed to Lancelot's finger hook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot did not move. If the match was just made, he had already lost more than a dozen times. And he has seen the situation where the magic circle is transmitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't move. Where do you want to go?" Gru said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot, who was just about to stop, stopped. He had to stop a cold chill and run through his spinal cord. The killing and imposing outsiders couldn’t feel it but they had covered him all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as he dares to move the magic array there, Gru will definitely come to him faster and more fierce than him. He is now completely in the other side. Under the momentum, he is already completely at a disadvantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are too weak." Gru shook his head and said that some regretted some hate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Weak?" Lancelot was stunned. No one has ever said this to him and said it is natural that he cannot even refute himself. It is really ‘weak’ that the person who said this has only fully controlled him by imposing manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are too many things on the body of the Paladin." Gru looked at Lancelot. He did not pay attention to the situation in other places. In his eyes, there was only Lancelot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...It’s true. There are too many extra things. You can’t win without saying anything.” Lancelot finally sighed and he didn’t go again. Look at the transfer magic array and turned around and watched Gru reach out and untied the glorious armor. A long sword was picked up from the body of a swordsman next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just lost because he is working with others and he wants to win too. He knows that as long as he can win the remaining orc troops of Gru, it is easier to deal with him. He is too scrupulous. He is the only person in Glorious Castle who has the ability to confront Gru. He is the spiritual pillar of all warriors. So can't die without losing. He has already thought too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are so strong and strong. The martial arts and equipment are not the most important, even the most important thing is the spirit and soul. The soul of the competition is who is more focused on the soul who burns his own power more thoroughly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been no more radiant battle. The pain left by the chest's foot was no longer suppressed. Lancelot felt it very clearly. He has no other things besides a sword in his hand. He has not felt this way for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It didn't feel like this for a long time..." Lancelot took the sword and walked toward Gru. There is no vindictiveness or murderousness on his body that looks like an ordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ogre warriors have now had no armor and no vindictive rushing over and rushing over and there are five or six Werewolf warrior. These are the paladins who originally wore the brilliance armor of the orcs around the magical array. They can also let their last reason be scrupulous. Now this person suddenly drops the armor without any vindictiveness and murderousness. It is undoubtedly an undefended meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot is still not walking fast in Grupo, but it doesn’t stop every step. The intensity of each step is also complete. The same is not bad. He looked straight at Gruen and didn't look at the orcs who rushed to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five or six werewolves suddenly made a mourning at the same time, whether it was the rush of the running rush, all the likes of the empty pockets, smashed down a few times It won't move. They didn't have much scars, all of them had a small wound in their throat. It’s just that the throat is injured. These werewolves will never fall. It’s just that the wound has continued until the root of the back of the neck just splits the medulla. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot’s hand still does not seem to move on the hilt of the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ogres have not stopped. These two monsters have long been murdered. The huge mace in their hands is all on the flesh of the swordsman. The heavy sputum was also filled with blood like a flesh roller compactor drilled in two blood pool hells. The armor and the axe on their body can withstand and the whole body is wrapped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loud bang of Lancelot pulled the sword straight to Gru. He didn't seem to touch the eater, but the two huge monsters that were heavy and heavy, like the toy pieced together, were touched and the armor of the body was broken together into dozens of scattered blood. In the rain, the whole person of Lancelot was poured red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Lancelot had always been a calm and tall mountain, then this mountain has become a volcano. It is burning the deepest magma. There are no active volcanoes without any scruples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the orcs who are rushing toward him all go backwards. Such murderous and killings are no less than just Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no longer a Paladin to find a way to defeat the generals of Oufu. Only two men are full of war and bloodthirsty. The students are born on the other side's death and are still eager to feel the mutual touch of the soul on the edge of life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is right." Gru's granite-like face had a smile. "Let me make my state better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a mess of turkey near the magic circle. The white magical light curtain broke through the orcs and immediately swarmed. Although Lancelot attracted some, but the power contrast is still huge. Although the white magic of the cardinal door is superb, but the orc is too much paralyzed, the four ogres have just been appointed, and then the head of a cardinal is directly knocked out by the werewolf meteor hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not just sending a magical array, it’s just a unilateral slaughter. This person just happened to ease the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who came is Talis. As soon as the magic light curtain disappeared, she appeared from the transmission magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that she can’t compete with so many orcs, but she actually brought in several elements of the summoned scroll and opened a few tall giants. Appeared around. Then there was a scroll of giant rock scattered and thundering bombs. More than a dozen werewolves and lizards were suddenly flesh and blood under high-level magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half is half of the female intuition that she knows much more than other cardinals when she heard the alarm bell in the cathedral of Erasia Instead of rushing to come directly, they rushed to take all the high-level scrolls from St. Peter's Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the power of the Shield and the close-fighting Guardian White Magic is immediately apparent. Heaven's God's Guardian Prayer... A whole lot of high-level magic is added to the body of several giants. These summoning creatures are able to withstand the orcs around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister Ai Meimei? How come you are here?" Talis was now in the transfer magic circle, Ai Mei quickly picked up. Ayi Mei is still shaking the scenes of the screaming flies of the beasts around her, so that she still has some unconsciousness and even Talis is not immediately recognized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
