			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first day after Clovis left, Asa easily entered the pagan church of nature. After spending a day in it and inquiring about the day, he has already learned about the history of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really a very weird pagan church. The most bizarre thing is that most of its loose structures are villagers in nearby villages or almost all villagers in nearby villages, and many people in the city of Airy have become believers. Some of the more prestigious people, such as the village head, became the head of the self. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term 'pagan' is a bit reluctant for them. The farmer's farming in the arable land of the peasants should do what they do and at least make no difference in lifestyle from normal people. As long as the local officials do not interfere with their behavior, they do not go against the official. As opposed to other mysterious and strange pagans, they did not have the slightest alert for all those who came to participate. It was very warm and welcoming and inviting others to enter the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing they can do to show a 'paganism' is that they go to the sacred forest every day at noon to sit down and worship in nature. God's cares for meditation. The method of meditation is simple and easy to learn. Even the illiterate farmer can sit on his knees and sit on his mind and feel meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This easy-to-learn meditation is the leader of the god of nature who teaches the believers to the believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prophet adults are the people of the gods of nature. No one knows him or know where he is from. The last time the army came to drive away the gods of nature, the prophets adults claimed that they would feel the miracle of the god of nature. As a result, these guardian statues suddenly appeared to let all those who offend the god of nature disappear. Since then, under the influence of such a powerful and powerful miracle, the god of nature has grown stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon today, a new group of new believers will be taken to the sacred forest to feel the power of the god of nature. Asa is also mixed in. But naturally he wouldn't be feeling the gods. He was going to see the prophet and see the weird statues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be the fastest way to solve the problem here before you can leave to catch up with Rod Hart. The troops brought by the four or five thousand believers are really insignificant. And these believers are nothing but ordinary people. So the most effective way to do this now is to find out the leader of this group and figure out how they are doing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Protestants who went to worship places were old-fashioned people in their fifties who heard that they were a teacher at a school in the city of Airy. These more learned people in the god of nature spread their faith to the believers. He walked all the way to explain the teachings of the new comrades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The greatness of nature is born to nourish us but not to return. How great is it. And those who serve the rulers and nobles to make us obedient The god that was created and the mother of this great creature are seemingly ugly and powerless." "So 'naturally' is our creed. We will not bind the believers to do anything like those artificial religions. I don't feel any awkward things at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't need to say more about using your own eyes to see the great god of nature. The forest is felt with its own heart and soul. The power that shocks people is not the same as the puppet clay in the church. As long as you face the natural meditation of the natural god every day, you can feel this great nature. In the end, the realm of harmony between man and nature is taken away from this worldly trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new believers nodded their heads and sighed. As long as you have more time to sit, you can combine heaven and man. This is really easy and cheap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa has a strange feeling that this sect can grow so amazingly in such a short period of time, except for the use of whispers, the biggest feature is because it Too... How do you say that Asa knows a lot of vocabulary? I can’t explain this feeling to myself. I can only say that it’s too...good quality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what kind of religion is to attract believers with the promise and the power of display. The church uses heaven and hell to intimidate and lure the power of the magician and the priests. Now the power of this natural god is more common understanding. It is not only the feeling that can really shock the soul, but also the guardian statue that suddenly appears. This is a force that is far more powerful than the prayers of the church and has to be convinced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind of meditation that Asa learns to join at the beginning of his life has been taught when he is mixed in. It was very simple to change the magician's basic meditation. Removing all the magical factors will only make the meditation person feel calm and full of energy. And if you meditate in front of the whispering sensation, you will naturally feel the shock of the deep soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa also finds it very strange to use so cheap and slogans to lure so many people to do what? Just sit there every day? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now there is no time to delve into these. As long as today, the ghost tricks that have found the so-called guardian statues have seen the so-called prophets. If you catch the catch, you will have to kill it, and then you will smash it. The rest is much easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Protestants came to the sacred forest under the guidance of old scholars. It was the grass that the first encounter between Asa and Ved Nina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grass that once filled with killings and zombies is now in a peaceful and solemn atmosphere. Thousands of devout believers sit on the grass and face the front. The forest closed its eyes and thought that even the Cathedral of the Magic Academy did not have such a grandeur when it was praying. These are just a few of the three or four thousand believers. It is said that there are several other places in the periphery of this forest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is sandwiched in Protestants I saw the long-lost whispering forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the mysterious forest that once frightened, Asa clearly feels the depths of the soul that once shocked people, making people fearful, fearful, and even afraid The power of looking up has almost disappeared, leaving only a little momentum as if a dying giant's breath continues to reverberate and maintain the dignity of this ancient holy place between the old trees. And now the believers in the land have added some ridiculous taste to this remnant majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new believers were the first to see the whispering of the singer immediately conquered by this remaining gods. The previous skepticism immediately made a big step toward Prudential. All the people were amazed and some of them fell down directly. The old-fashioned and sincere expression led them to walk towards the edge of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa walked with the new believers around, but his attention was on dozens of stone statues standing on the grass. These are the things that have been legendary in the night and have been inexplicably represented here by the worshippers of the gods of nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These strange statues are all the same. There are five or six meters tall human body with claws on the limbs like a mouse. Not so small, the squatting mouth has two sheep-like horns and a pair of bat-like wings on the back. These stone statues are in a semi-squatting position with a distance of several tens of meters from each other to form an arc-shaped whispering singer. It seems that as the legends of these believers are guarding this sacred forest. According to the believers, these stone statues appear silently overnight in the forest. The rules of the forest form neatly form a circle to protect the forest. This is something that manpower can't do. It is not a miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Asa is now sure that these strange statues have nothing to do with the absolute whispering of the forest. Such things have never been seen in the elves' dwelling place, and the quirky styling is obviously contrary to the elves' old-fashioned but advocating aesthetic style. What's more, the dead wood guards are enough to protect them and they still use these strange and ugly stone statues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stepped forward and touched one of the stone statues. The texture is indeed a stone and the lifelike shape is definitely not made by ordinary craftsmen. Asa carefully stared at the stone statue, which was a bit strange and suddenly faintly felt an ominous feeling from the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't use your dirty hands to touch this god of nature." An old woman believes rushed up and hit his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure?" Asa again seemed to ask the old woman as if she was muttering. The look is full of horror and shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman thinks that this daring guy has already felt the dignity of the gods and sat down with satisfaction and continued to meditate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa’s heart is now shocked. Because he felt a slight wave of magic when he put his hand on the statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the magical fluctuations will never surprise him because he had expected that these inexplicable things should be magical. The reason why he was shocked was that these magical fluctuations were very familiar and familiar with the taste of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stared at the dozens of statues on the grass. According to the old sayings, this is only a part of the whispering of a hundred. Looking at the devout believers in the grass, Asa suddenly felt creepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The believers who worship the god of nature, please gather together. I have something to say." A very loud and full-bodied voice suddenly sounded. Even on this wide grass, everyone can hear clearly that the believers who were sitting there quietly gathered there after hearing the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a prophet." The believers seemed to be as excited as they heard the fairy sound. "The prophet must have an important thing to announce."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa struggled to finally make a way out of the crowd and came to see the closeness of the prophet. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tens of thousands of respected people really seem to be the kind of courtesy of Asa. If you see it elsewhere, you must think it is a worldly Supreme Hermit. His white clothes were spotless and the silver head and long beard were mixed together to look holy and extraordinary. His face is more majestic and every wrinkle is like a synonym for high morality and a description of the mysteries of the universe. He sat under a stone statue. The stone statue was closest to the whispering forest and the shape was also different from the other. The two wings on the back were unfolded to protect the prophet at his own feet in a hug. Even if it is just because of such a temperamental leader, it is reasonable to attract so many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The already intimate believers gathered again and again to pick up the shoulders, but the birds were silently watching the tiny movements of the Prophet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The comrades who worship the god of nature, I want to tell you a good news." The voice of the prophet's voice was loud and he was carrying his back to the whispered forest. The fascinating power seems to be mixed with his mysterious charm that his voice will infect more. He raised his finger to the stone statues and said: "According to my understanding of the meditation communication with the god of nature, the god of nature will come to the body of every person who prays and prays beside the guardian statue tomorrow. The miracle will It will make us heaven and man unite to reach the highest realm that our life has been pursuing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of repression still reveals a huge sigh of excitement from believers Their mouths converge and sweep across the grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the prophet sounded again and everyone was quiet and afraid to miss the tiniest note from his mouth. But his voice is so loud that everyone can hear it clearly. "Because tomorrow's prayer meditation is the most important thing, everyone has to rest and raise their spirits tonight. And I will also be here to communicate with God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Asa suddenly remembered a believer next to a believer: "I heard that the Prophet has never left this place since the appearance of these statues?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The believer is very sure to nod: "Yes. The Prophet is used to communicate with the god of nature all the time. He will meditate here no matter day and night and wind and rain. Never leave. You even Don't you know what's new?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will you never leave here day and night? He doesn't have to eat and take a bath?" Asa forcefully Look at the perfect religious leader. He suddenly determined that one person, or someone who can still be said to be a human being, is by no means a necromancer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the prophet who has a heart with the god of nature." The saints you contact should not use such sleazy words." The believers are very dissatisfied with this new comrade. "Do you know? Your luck is really good. You can meet this kind of good thing just by joining."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed and agreed. "I also feel that my luck is good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not so much to say that it’s dying to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thousands of believers who sat here during the day in accordance with the instructions of the prophet have all gone home to raise the miracle that will come tomorrow at noon tomorrow. spirit. Now there is no movement of any living things. A new moon and a glimmer of starlight are falling dead on the old trees and stone statues. The ancient trees are still scattered with the majesty. The wild beasts and birds are not afraid to approach here. Even the wind does not have only stone statues. Looking at the forest for a long time, I silently confronted the gods of the ancient trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two footsteps in the darkness of the distance broke the silence of death. The two figures slowly separated from the darkness and slowly approached here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prophet did not respond to these two sudden appearances and still sat there so sacredly and solemnly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two figures approached and came directly to the prophet. The prophet still did not respond, and even did not move at all, still immersed in his own meditation. But the two visitors did not show any tribute to this devout focus. One of them even extended his hand and pressed it on the white head of the prophet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prophet was very tolerant and still sat quietly without even eyelids. This rude person does not seem to appreciate the fact that he pressed the wrist on the head of the prophet and then grabbed the long, straight and upward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prophet’s adult still didn’t move his face. It’s still so quiet and dignified, but a silver has been uncovered like a lid with the lid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original quiet and dead environment seems to be active. After the heads of many prophets are uncovered, a large group of insects have a locust-like appearance. There are even insects with wings that seem to have been tired of being so tired of the solemn and dignified residence. Suddenly exposed to the air, they are excited and squirming and whistling, and some strange tweets. The person who raised the head of the prophet used the other hand to slap the active little bugs and read a few spells. The little bugs quieted and re-drilled into the depths of the head of the prophet. The man nodded with satisfaction and said: This insect is probably only used until tomorrow. But there should be no problem supporting the call to the believers at noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides his companion said in an old voice: This worm has really deceived so many people easily and easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a prestige in a small town in a small town. But in the back, I often ** some little girls who are less than ten years old. I occasionally revealed that he didn’t believe the whole city, but he thought that I was the real prisoner. At that time, I had the original appearance and it turned out to be so useful. It happened that I had to go home to deal with some things some time ago, so I took him to live and made this insect to call the believers. You see that the appearance of this appearance is really good. There are now four or five thousand people for us to use. During this time, they are letting them sit still and meditate. They told them to go back to sleep and raise their spirits tomorrow. Their energy must be very good. It must meet our requirements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voices of these two people are very strange. It sounds like there is always a sob in the throat that makes people feel unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only four or five thousand at a time, and these gargoyles can’t eat that much. The voice of his companion was so pale and indifferent as if he was talking about a table of uninteresting meals. The reason you compiled is really effective for these idiots, the highest realm that God and man are united in. I can't think of a person who can actually lie to four or five thousand people to join you. This is just a group that comes out of action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Strictly speaking, they didn't lie to them". This person said with gusto. "It is really to let them reach the highest realm that life is pursuing. Death is not the highest state of life. Is it true that all living is for this ultimate purpose? Isn’t the most poor pity in the world thinking about what to pursue? The illusory mysterious and unpredictable goal to get rid of the dissatisfaction reality, so that they end their lives in wonderful fantasy is not very kind and poetic?" The man looked up and sighed at the starry sky. Tomorrow must be a good day. With your hundred and eight gargoyles, there are so many enthusiastic people who help. After noon, this ancient miracle forest and all the elves inside will be ashes. This feat of tens of thousands of years from no one has been completed in our hands and even made me a little long-lost excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves of the world tree belong to our solar well to see if we can use it to destroy it. Even if he said such a grand plan, his companion’s voice was still bleak and indifferent, and there was nothing to leak. “Why, in fact, did Vedena’s woman have a chance last time? I don't know how she did the hard work, but she just took away the leaves of a world tree and was finally wasted by her. Women are really extravagant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please be considerate. Wayward is the privilege of girls and their lovely place. It’s not good to be here by hand. This person puts the head cover of the prophet back in place to make this disgusting look look so solemn and solemn. No matter what you have to do it yourself. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know clearly that I have been busy with other things some time ago. I don't care about this. But since the prophet has already released the words, those who are enthusiastic and sincere will surely come along. No one can stop it." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hehehehe" The old voice seems to have been inspired by this upcoming success with a weird laugh. "It’s been said that everyone hasn’t joined up like this for a long time. It’s just that if you have more people than just one person, I’m afraid that even the guy from Nopolino will not have enough capital to make so many gargoyles. Thanks to your proposal. We will think of such a way to deal with the enchantment of the Sunwell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This method is not my original, we have to thank" the voice of this person Suddenly stopped, he carefully looked at the weird and precise props of the insects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" asked his companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person whispered for a moment and said, "Nothing is a mouse." Then he turned and waved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a black lightning in the dark, a vague shadow suddenly spurted from the shadow of a tree not far away, and his figure was in midair. The light flame shines brightly. The place where he stood just now has become a tall ancient tree in the sea of ​​fire. It instantly becomes a fierce fire. As long as this person's action is slower, the whole person will be decomposed into ashes by this magical flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a strongly near-perfect fire wall that is released from the magical power to fully ignite into a dazzling flame, but the burning fire is so fierce The entire forest and grass that was originally dark and illuminating also illuminate the two figures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the figure, this should be an old man and a middle-aged person. Both of them are ordinary gray robes with a silver skull mask on their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one’s eyes can tolerate such a strong light contrast, whether the attacker or the attacker is full of glare in this moment’s eyes It is. Even everyone did not even have time to see the other party's appearance. The people in the air and the two people on the ground reached out and grabbed their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slightly older person on the ground is struggling to keep his eyes open while he is trying to whisper to the statue of the prophet. Shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original statue is just a stone but with this magical shout and gesture immediately has life, it suddenly suddenly moved up and stone carving The resulting muscles really burst into a huge dynamic. It bounced off and the pair of huge wings rushed toward the man still in midair. The sharp giant claws of the body's body size open a wide mouth and reveal the dense teeth inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man in the air is still squinting but when the giant claw of the stone statue is about to hold him, he is volleying a giant claw that turns over the stone statue and rubs him around him. And too. His feet flew out into the depths of the forest with his hands on the stone statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attacker on the ground fired the wall first to restore sight. He looked up and immediately saw the target of the sky flying to the whispering forest. He raised his hand and silver. The ball of light rolls and flies away in the air with the sparks that flow around it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the ball of light is about to hit the target, the man seems to have finally noticed a huge fireball coming out of his hand and hitting this ball lightning In the same breath, the sparks and electro-optic lights of the whole forest were completely illuminated by the impact of this brilliance. The stone statues in the air screamed like a thousand pigs, and the screams were violently blasted. The shock has retreated. In the dazzling light, the man in the midair was mixed with the air and went straight into the depths of the whispering forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man next to the wave of gargoyles encouraged the wings to rush toward the direction of the man. But when I just flew forward, the huge wings immediately sluggish. The original flexible and fast movements stiffened like a chicken that fell into the water and tried to slam a few more moves. It stopped completely and seemed to change again. Back a bunch of lifeless stones straight into the depths of the forest and a muffled sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enchantment of the Sunwell still has an effect. The magical driving force of the gargoyle does not work in the forest. The old man who commanded the stone shook his head. How to do? It seems that it is not an elf but a personal class. Without my commander, the gargoyles can only move when they are pre-set. What if he has done damage before? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
