			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword descends from the sky. The Rolander did not move, but his swordsman holding a sword had already skyrocketed and went straight into the sky. The bang of the air shattered like a smashing air that was broken by the sky. There are countless tornadoes of different sizes, as if they were innocently smashed by this sword. Countless sized dragon rolls are wrapped in a sword next to the sword, so this broken sky condenses all the power of Roland as a sharp and fierce madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword is coming. The people of Lancelot have been unable to see and see only an unprecedented unprecedented unprecedented shine for the fierce light of the Cross Sword. The sword has just been in the direction of the sword. The yellow sand and the undead wreckage are like the sea water. The sword is turned into a white light and the sword is turned over. The ground under the sword is completely cracked. The crack that sees the bottom extends along this line to the horizon as if the land was cut by this sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Jane's to the huge icicles behind Asa smashed the scattered pieces of the sky before they even fell in the air and continued to break into powder. The tornado in the yellow sand of the ground has just been mixed and bumped, and immediately shattered and the broken pieces continue to shatter the swords of the two swords. The swords and swords are coincident with the price drop. All the pieces of the space are smashed and smashed. Broken and broken...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that is not broken is Asa. Even the ground under his feet has broken into countless pieces that can hardly be broken, and he flies in the void. Still walking step by step, but now it is not just to go but to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knife in his right hand draws a round in front of him. Then slashed out with a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This knife seems to have not been cut, but the surrounding swordstorm suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Roland and Lancelot can feel that this knife is to separate the combo of the benefactor. This knife has no power. It is just a kind of empty void. This empty position is precisely at the strongest and closest point of the two forces. Just like the most dense part of the line heads gathered by countless line segments is also the most critical point. Once the entire structure is broken, it is scattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Light Cross Sword is one of the glory of the Light. But still still stabbed in front of Asa's strong incomparable vindictiveness and swordsmanship composed of lightsaber, although there is no other sharpest part is enough to pierce any enemy. At this time of knowledge, Asa’s second knife cut out the same lightly slashed knife and cut it on the tip of the lightsaber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click. This even the great lightsaber that slashed the earth was actually completely smashed and sounded like a broken sword by the sword without any strength. The sound of Lancelot's armor and some of his limbs shattered and burst open. He couldn't help but watch him suddenly squirting blood all the way back like a stone that had been slammed back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland's sword hit. When Asa repelled Lancelot. Although he was partially broken, he still smashed Asa for the fierceness of nine days. The bang loud noise is not inferior to the huge bulge in the ground. The air that has just gathered around is broken and shattered under this sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really awkward. Although he slightly turned his side to the head of the sword, he still slammed his shoulder and tore a piece of the armor that changed the gown of the Ghost King. The armor that the king of the Necromancer used to claim the strongest defense was finally broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but only second. All the effects of this sword on Asa are only a few inches long cracks in the armor. It seems to be a bottomless black hole. No matter how strong the sword is, then there is no response like falling into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding ground is cracking, the exhaust air is violent, and the sword’s glory makes this small circle like a catastrophe. He is not a world except the small one on the shoulder. The crack did not reveal any involvement between him and the world around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the knife that just repelled Lancelot and then recovered and fluttered into the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;empty. Roland, who is hundreds of meters away, only feels empty when he feels that he is not only hitting Asa. Now he feels that his sword is empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the puncturing of this knife, the central part of the sword that is originally condensed, such as the entity, is suddenly empty and not sucked. It is not being defeated but suddenly it is empty. Immediately, the whole swordsmanship began to collapse. The forces that were abundant everywhere were all back to the central backlash and then ran out of control. This hollow is not only the sword air, but has already reached the arm of Roland. He feels that his blood and bones contain the same power as the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody light broke out and Rolander stumbled backwards. The sword-bearing hand and the sword were crushed and shattered by the sword that was out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the beginning to the end Asa only used the right hand of the knife to have defeated the big 6 two strong swordsman's one-handed blow. The real weapon, the black star that he has been holding in his left hand, has not moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His power is not horrible. There is no trace of earth-shattering. It can even be said that there is no power, but the knowledge is nothing but any earth-shattering power is in front of him. So vulnerable is so vulnerable. The emptiness and the hollow can smash any power under his illusory eyes that seem to be able to make all the laws of the candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot was also hit with such a blow and his injuries were definitely heavier than Roland. Because he does not have the cushion of the hundreds of meters of sword. Fortunately, the brilliance of the body has eliminated some of his power for him, and when he smashed the smashing armor, he changed his own position and the strength of the sword and strength that he had lost out of control with his countless births and deaths. Instead, blow him up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand has been crushed together with the Glorious Battlegear. There are small bones and broken muscles. There are also a lot of explosives and the muscles sprayed in the air almost in the air. Half of the body. If it wasn't for the extra spell that Moriel gave him, he would have made his body multiply and he was already dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the sword is out of control, the power of Lancelot, such as the shells, generally flies backwards and flies. The place where he just stood falls behind the original coalition. The location was heavily placed on the sand. The broken bone that hit the body in the lower body all penetrated the muscle again and he almost fainted. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coalition has long withdrawn from the undead bones and sands, which are now empty and empty like the rest of the world. But there are still two people standing here alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two are all unformed weapons that have been slashed by numerous portable blood vessels. They are all members of the warriors who are desperately fighting on the wreckage of countless undead. I can imagine how they had shouted with the swordsman orc in the coalition. They did not go together when retreating. Not forcibly taking away can only show that they asked for their own stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not because they are them but they. Although the two men are messy. The blood wounds of the whole city and his comrades are no more than the warriors on the battlefield. But the blood and the wounds can't hide the good face. These are two women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two did not stand together. This position seems to have not even seen each other when they fought in the coalition. It was only with the retreat of the coalition that the two talents with common choices stood out. But they didn’t look at each other and maybe they didn’t even look at each other. They just stared at the place where the king of the dead appeared. The heroes who passed the salvation turned into demon-goking devils. They saw that the people who escorted them were desperately trying to kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until Lancelot flew down, these two talents have reflected that the tall-skinned woman ran straight to the whole body and was bloody Lancelot Shouting and shouting the white magic used for treatment: "Teacher teacher..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the support of white magic Lancelot is finally awake The magic that Mollier used on him at this moment also resonated with the white magic to resonate with his body. But Lanslot did not pay any attention to this knowledge. This woman was shocked and asked: "How come you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He doesn't want me to come and sneak up on my own Going to the Magic Academy and mingling into the swordsman." Talis answered her look and was miserable. "How can the teacher become like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot looked at another woman who came over and shook his head and sighed: "Mulak prime minister, you are also quietly coming in. "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;小懿 nodded slightly and her look is similar to Talis. The two women’s eyes are together. They are now showing each other that the other person’s eyes and look do not have to be spoken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The injury on his body is especially heavy. He has become a bloody person and even has a deep visible bone wound on his face. The flesh is turned on her soft face. Especially look awkward. Her strength does not support the battle here. She insists on this point with her spirit and perseverance. But now his spirit is empty. The belief that supports her has not fallen, but the whole change has been incredible and incredible. It is so clever that all the space is so smart. The mind is now completely numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
