			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s boring to treat the female knight before he died." Hilton turned to take a big shot at the young Yabin. His shoulders. The white magic of this young man made him very good. "Let you be the second one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Abbott did not stare at the flashing bonfire, a handsome, handsome face with a wooden sluggish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You think about doing a church knight or a beautiful horsewoman. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Who can have such a big 6? Opportunity? She must still be a woman." Hilton put out his tongue and licked his lips, and his voice was a little irritated by excessive excitement and **. "Think about the voice of the nephew who is on the high side. I can't look down on us. When I can do her, I can ask her if she is ***..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The young man suddenly stood up and his face still walked away without expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven’t seen the world or a child." Hilton shook his head and smiled. Although his appearance is worse than that of Helicika, now the 狰狞 and yf in the red bonfire can be called shudder by most people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid hasn’t snorted and just watched the bonfire quietly according to his injured hand. He suddenly said, "Forget it. If you want to kill, you will kill them directly. Don't do these disgusting things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Disgusting?" Hilton was surprised. It was the first time I heard the word. "What is this mixed out? You haven't seen it more disgusting than this." He looked at Helicika and smiled. "Yes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilika didn’t speak, only to show a smile that seemed to be very heart-felt. It’s also like a tiger expressing appreciation for the bloodthirsty of a wolf. sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid’s expression is ok. His body is somewhat obsessed, but he is as honest as the ancestors of the three generations facing the loess. In any case, he has restored the human form and he is like the most ordinary grocery shop owner. He looked at the bonfire with the same level as the book, and muttered: "You should still be a little conscience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Conscience? "Hilton's eyes are abrupt." shocked. Then he snorted and laughed, and the smile on his face was so tearing that he blew his blood and kept bleeding. But while he was still hurting, he was still laughing and he could hear that he was trying to restrain himself. But I can't control it. The laughter echoed in the trees and passed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Masked women Jessica and Hilika also looked at Druid with strange eyes. One is a joke. One is with an angry disgusting disdain as a mouse that has just gotten out of the pit and eats a big belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"**.**." Hilton finally stopped laughing. The scar on his face, even the sutured ground, broke a lot of blood and re-flowed. "This is the best laughter I have heard in my life. You don't go to church as a pastor to teach people to do what Druid really is a waste of talent."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid did not say anything and got up and walked away from this Abin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fucking seriously. I am miserable." Hilton dismissively spit on the back of Druid and then turned around and looked a little anxious. The man. "Don't worry about these two idiots. Go ahead..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the man didn’t even mean that he didn’t even move cold. A glance. The chill in the eyes is thicker than before. He slowly spit out two words: "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I not? Fuck." Hilton was a little excited and almost jumped up. If it weren't for the incredible skill and fighting power that the man had shown in the battle, he would immediately rush to grab the man. In desperation he looked at Helicika again. "You said this person..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silika smiled. Although this smile can still be used to scare people. But the calm and rationality of the land is unquestionable. He has been like this since he escaped from the basement. He smiled and said to the man a lot: "I believe you must have your own reasons to speak out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Hilton also looked at the man suddenly and seemed to feel that he understood." "Fuck you will not be... no, you will not like this scorpion. I tell you that she is a knight who is playing and killing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Then why are you..." Hilton asked with a squint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I keep her and ask her a lot of things. If she did it now, it would be no different from killing her. I can't ask if I want it." "The man smiled at Hilton. This is a standard smile. The smiling smile reveals a neat white tooth but looks like a slap in the mouth." "You can rest assured that I will let you participate and will let you go first. Finally I will send her body to Celeste to give Magnus the old bastard. I promise to let him. Eye-opening. Hahahaha..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hilton couldn’t help but shudder, whether it’s a fire or something else, it’s been poured by this cold laughter. There is no more Mars left. Instead, he said, "You don't have to be so exaggerated... you are joking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seriously killing a shrine knight that is already Hilton The crime of the maximum limit that can be imagined. If you really do what the man said, it’s not a crime. It’s crazy. That is equal to the fan of the pope, a slap in the face is openly screaming and enemies to the entire bright church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I never like to joke." The man looked at Hilton with a cold answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s someone else saying this or this man said before, Hilton would only think that this person is not crazy or just joking. But I saw that the man’s skill, especially the very strange knife, seems to be able to smell the bloody smell in the air until now. Hilton almost intuitively feels the man’s seemingly ordinary There is absolutely something unimaginable behind the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you doing this?" Hilton asked cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old man of Magnus also has Escher... These old and undead I have been fighting for a long time to deal with them... "The man's words suddenly seemed to think of something and didn't say anything anymore." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The masked woman Jessica suddenly asked: "Do you have a knife and a knife attached to it?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think anyone else is so good." The man said faintly. The eyes fell on her and scraped up and down like a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Darkness and... Necrotic..." Hilton’s voice grew smaller and then shut up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't look at me like that I can't stand it." Jessica smiled and her eyes flashed like a cat. The laughter was so sweet that even the thin and strong waist was twisted like a snake, as if it were in the bed with the lover. "It was the temple boy who recognized it. It can make the chick have a scruples in the battle, but the weapon alone will not be cut off by her brilliance armor. What is evil?" Everyone knows what is going on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some things are less known to live longer." The man faintly said. Half lying down and narrowing his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hilton kept looking at the man. The expression on the face was surprised and admired. There is also fear with respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica’s big eyes outside the mask also looked up and down the man and then showed some sly smiles and turned to dexterously jumped a tree in the lychee Lying down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Hilika faintly slammed the man and turned away. But after he turned around, he showed a smile. This smile is very sincere and very happy. Even the fierce face that can almost be compared with Bi Meng is not so embarrassed because of this real happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course this smile has no slightest sound. No one will ever see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other end of the tree at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid Anderson was faintly hearing the man’s voice when he finally heard the voices of the few men. This made him feel better in the moment. In many cases he believes that animals always get along much better than people. This is not just a belief in his place. More is due to his own inner feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a vaguely visible voice in front of someone who should be the young Yabin. Anderson was a little closer to hear that it was a remorse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson was surprised but not shocked. This young man will use pretty good white magic and definitely have something to do with it. But since he used white magic at a critical time to help the group deal with the Knights of the Temple, at least it would not be the undercover of the church. More importantly, since he can hear his voice, he can also detect himself. If there is nothing in the people, it is natural because there is no innocence in the heart. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Anderson is more annoying to the church because of the camp, but the sentence that the young man now mourns makes him feel strange. Those words and the subtle feelings in the voices of the mourners all make him feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are times when prayers and remorse have not stopped. Anderson couldn't help but ask: "Is it your faith?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin’s prayers and confession stopped and stood up for a while and answered: “Not counting Very confident." Immediately asked: "How did they get the female knight? I didn't seem to hear anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure, she is still okay. The man said that he is still not in a hurry. But it may be worse to say it later." Anderson sighed and suddenly looked at Abin. "Don't you be afraid to tell other people that you are a believer? You are here to pray and pray at this time. You must know that everyone including me is the enemy of the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin sighed and said. "I said that I don't believe in religion because I have been habitually cultivated by my grandfather all the time. And I don't want to regret it... I just don't want to hear the woman's screams and come here to find something to say to myself." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't believe in repentance, who will listen to who to listen to?" Anderson thinks this young man is very interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give it to me." Abin’s look was a glimpse. "The woman’s end can be counted as me. In fact, I really regret it now..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you must do this at the time." I can see that you really need that thousand gold coins and there is really no way to find so much money besides participating in this group." Anderson sighed and smiled. "Actually, I am similar to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember that you are asking for the three magic items stored in Sierra Leone. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the sacred thing that our Druid lost many years ago. Now, apart from me and a few companions, our party is almost extinct. I I have to get back those things before I die. Why do you need that much money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I want to take my sister around for medical treatment." A touch of replies. There are still some vicissitudes on his face that are not consistent with his age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson’s eyes said: “I may be able to help you. Our Druid’s treatment of healing, especially herbal medicine, is no worse than the white magic of the church. What is your sister's illness?" Yabin whispered for a moment and whispered: "She is crazy. Because she is scared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson disappointed with a cry This is by no means the efficacy of herbal medicine. Then he asked again: "Then you should find the church to help. If it is the cardinal magician's white magic may be effective and some people in the church study the mental magic heard about the cardinal Ace of Elazia However, he has a very high level of mental magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I find them and I will join this group?" Yabin smiled and looked at Anderson. Say: "You and I said that it seems that I am going to leave you to go and go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The honest Druid is stunned. People's relationships are actually very subtle and should even be guarded against each other. However, he was really not good at dealing with this aspect of the heart and smiled: "I just talked about it. Anyway, you are now doing this to help us catch the Knights of the Temple and can not go to the church again." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, I can't help it..." Yabin said with a wry smile that his body and voice suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to you?" Anderson asked. He can see the change in the expression on the face of Abin, but the moonlight is not bright enough to see what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin turned and the moonlight was falling on his face. It turned out to be a smile. The soft and clear smile is more gracious on his otherwise beautiful face. He smiled at Druid and said, "Nothing, let's go back to rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
