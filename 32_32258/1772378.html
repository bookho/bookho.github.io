			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adela whispered a paragraph and it was still only Lancelot to hear it. Lancelot’s face was finally amazed. Quiet down and calm down. The murderousness in his eyes has disappeared. He looked at Adela’s nod and replied slowly: "I understand... Since this is the meaning of your majesty, I will certainly assist you..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Adela smiled and nodded. His smile is still good-looking. Just as women are now more than one layer of unclear majesty and heavy inside. "Oh, you really don't look at the wrong person, Lancelot, you are really trustworthy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is fine, that's fine." The Cardinal and several great priests were not very clear about what happened, but they finally breathed a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contrary to everyone else, the smile that has just been brilliant on the face of Bishop Hamm has disappeared. The look that I had just seen in Lancelot is now in his eyes. Now it’s his turn to stare at Adela as if he is piercing the smiling face with his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talis gave the Bishop of Adela a look at what the Bishop Hamas said was his."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the teacher..." Talis still hesitated and she knew the identity of the acting pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot did not care to say faintly: "Bishop Adela has now represented the Pope. He is now the Pope and you don't have to worry." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Talis nodded. She took out the green leaves from her own arms and shed the brilliance and immediately dyed the faces of several people around her. "That's this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Lancelot and Adela both screamed at the same time, not only their faces but their eyes. The leaves are dyed light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Majesty, I don’t think this will be because of Bishop Hamm." The color of surprise only flashed on Lancelot’s face and he Sneering for a moment, I took the leaves of the world tree from Talis. Looked at Inham. I don't know if it is a distraction or if he has already admitted that Adela's identity has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Tim’s eyes suddenly lighted up and then fainted and sneered, but this sneer has more than a bit of a bitter smile in it. His face is already a bit green. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that it will not be his thing. It seems that he was mistaken by Bishop Hamm." Adela saw Inham and glanced at it. nod. "Is this something brought by this little girl? Wait for her to ask her..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, Master Adelaide. Lancelot. It’s really that I got it wrong. It’s not mine.” Inham suddenly sighed and stunned the two. "But I was excited. I was wrong. It was a misunderstanding with the Knights of Talis..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh it was like this." Ade La and Lancelot looked at each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Hamm stepped back and said, "I suddenly thought it was a little urgent. The friend who helped the child may have been treated. Now it is everywhere. I have to rush to see the orcs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Hamm began to retreat. Lancelot immediately followed a step forward but Adela put his hand to stop Lancelot. "Bishop Einham is going to go. I also hope that Mr. Stephen can really treat Bishop Jawi..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Inham’s body shape Xunyuan went to Lancelot and said softly: "He seems to know... isn't this a tiger?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adra shook his head slightly and only allowed Lancelot heard the voice: "There is no way. The current environment and circumstances are not suitable... and he may not dare to look at Stephen from the leaves of the world tree he desperately wants." There should be no ability to completely cure his son. He may have come back to ask us..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing the face of the Cardinal and the great priests It’s all confusing. They are completely puzzled by the words of the three people and can't imagine what it is all about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whether there is anything to destroy these orcs, we will win. Oufu has already lost because he is already dead." Lancelot said faintly. However, there is no joy of victory in his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are so many twists and turns with so many unexpected thrills, we finally won. Everything is in our hands. "Adela took over the leaves of the world tree from Lancelot and held it tightly in his hand. In his hand, the ring of the white king and the radiance of the leaves of the green world tree shined with each other. I touched my face and pinched it. It seemed to be a special feeling. The elasticity and feel of the body sighed. "Is it a luck to be alone?" I really want to think that this is the care of God..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Report..." A swordsman with a fresh tank shouted and rushed here When he came over, his footsteps stumbled. He could see that he was suffering from a minor injury. He was going to rush toward the Temple of Light. "I want to see my majesty, I have a thousand military rushes to report..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to report? Say it. "Lancelot frowned and drank.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about your majesty?" "The swordsman swayed and stood still and stood still. It seemed that even the mind was a bit unclear. There were several minor injuries on his body. The two great priests quickly stepped forward and used him to heal the magic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw... I saw him as if he had rushed out from the orc..." said Talis, who helped Ayimei.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the generals of General Erasia Oling, the swordsman of the court, Sosa, has an urgent military situation to report to his majesty..." The swordsman bent over and coughed up a large group of blood. Can transfer magic The strength of this swordsman in the large number of orcs around the array has been quite good. But no one cares about this. He coughed up the blood and said everyone has been shocked. "Dragon... The dragon is coming... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A huge black dragon has destroyed the palace of Elazia and is flying in the direction of Celeste..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, Hamm has rushed back to the basement.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The low-key behavior is completely different. He almost went all the way to kill and go back there. Whether it is the swordsman priest or the orc and the bulls, all the words of the road are all blown into pieces by his hands and burned into coke to form a zombie. He even used the Necromancer magic without hesitation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mood has never been so bad, it’s almost out of control, he’s already guessed That's what happened.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong with this kind of thing. It’s the most real idea of ​​people’s inadvertently. This is because Hamm is very clear. From Lancelot’s “陛下” exit, Inham knew that Adela was not the cardinal of Adela, but the true pope of Gevin Magnus. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of the sound and the smell have not changed, but it is indeed the true Pope Magnus. Or Adela's body Magnus The only way to explain Lancelot and Ade Abnormal reaction.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most advanced spell of reincarnation soul magic. Soul magic has been regarded as a heresy and almost extinct magic system for centuries. It's harder to master more people than spiritual spells. But I can't think of Magnus's last use of the ring to use this magic and actually make him successful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Adra’s idiot thinking that he killed Magnus and couldn’t wait to bring the ring to the relationship...? Maybe Magnus has always cultivated him as his own replacement body. Even so, the magic is only one-tenth of the chance of success...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it luck? This is something that no one else can count on the calculations, but it can make everything change. Is it because of this kind of luck that all the efforts of all the arrangements have been put to the east? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you are born, no matter how unwilling you are, you will only face it. Because Hamm decided to enter the basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, how are you going back?" Stephen had already sat on the wooden chair on one side and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
