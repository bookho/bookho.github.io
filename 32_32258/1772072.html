			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werewolf’s stomach is not very accustomed to vegetarianism and it is said that there is also a training ground for the breeding of beasts. The meat is very scarce and there is no supply to the field. Humanity. The soil of the wild land is very strange and can not grow food such as wheat and soybean. Oufu has no restaurants and restaurants for humans. Almost all foreigners can only eat in the hotel. food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hotel is also specially prepared for the foreign people. The boss here is a half-orc, and the human language is very smooth. The half-beast body is stronger than humans. It has a pig-like mouth. Two fangs are looking up from the mouth to make them look fierce and a bit stupid. But in fact, in terms of intelligence, they are the most prominent of all orcs, and they are almost no different from humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the Cyclops has been sent back and is quietly lying in the dining room of the hotel. It was covered with a cloth by the Orc owner to prevent the guests from being affected. appetite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one has ever claimed the body. The man who executed the death sentence led the two werewolves to carry him back to the hotel. The hotel was originally a subordinate of the City Hall and knew that it was a group with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other guests have already finished eating and leaving Xiaoxiao because they have seen the hanging appetite and stayed upstairs in the room where the thieves were in the corner and the old thieves Fodo talked about eating the food on the plate. It is a paste-like thing made from the fruits and tubers of some unique plants on the wild land. It is only one or two mouths that still feel swallowed. But when you eat a lot, there is a kind of thick greasy taste. I also went straight to the head and rushed the rough powder and smashed the throat and smothered the pain. Even the half-orc boss occasionally had great compassion and added some beef and mutton to make it hard to improve the strong impact on the mouth. The thieves have eaten this for ten days and many people have eaten with anger. This is completely different from the expectation that they made a big ticket and then went to spend the day. But even if you have a big temper, you will never dare to play here. The ogres and the werewolves can be seen at any time. The stone tablets and gallows standing on the square are excellent. Calming agent. However, the anxiety that has been accumulated every day has made many people very dissatisfied with the thieves of the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old thieves have been trying to run between the big ear and the orcs these days and hope to find ways to communicate with them and get the stolen goods. Now that he knows the specifics of some of the cities, the managers of the city seem to be human. This is good news. In the experience of thieves, the same kind of beasts who are far less than oil and salt are much better to deal with. Some people suggest secretly abducting the families of these people. Some people suggest that they threaten to threaten directly, but they are all innocent sayings of professional habits. From the expression of Buddha, he seems to have only planned himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa mixed in the thieves group, holding a plate and eating the food in one bite, only he can eat this kind of thing with gusto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man who was preparing to retire the corpse and accompanied by a werewolf informed them that all of this group would go to the central square tomorrow afternoon. Said that they have something to announce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the thieves had just discussed, they immediately boiled up. The central square is just the chilled body where the one-eyed dragon was hanged. Many people are also saddened by the loss of this accomplices. During this period of time, the anger of resentment and the anger of the guilty conscience was allied by this ambiguous notice. Many people took out their weapons and clamored for a fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mom wants us to send them up and wait for them to hang them? Kill one without losing the money and kill two." A robber waving his hand The knife is licking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fodoro quickly stopped everyone but didn’t work. A few people are already swearing, is he and these orcs colluding to deceive everyone here like some private minerals to catch the big ear monsters as slaves, intending to take them as a coolie or prepare to feed them like cattle and sheep at any time. Come as food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you say should be done?" Someone asked for advice from Asa. After all, he is the most qualified criminal in this body. It is also best to have a calm and calm look at the end of everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa still does not want to eat the kind of mushy food that looks really the most relaxed and confident. He said vaguely while eating: "I don't know what to say tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The consequences of going to tomorrow are at least maybe the result of rushing out the knife now. It's ok. How do you do it for you? Just don't know me when you get caught." Asa finished eating and putting it down. The plate went out. He was completely unconcerned about such a tense situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this tense atmosphere, casual attitudes and indifferent words are undoubtedly the most shocking and persuasive. The thieves saw that someone was so calm and infected. They calmed down and had a clever point. They also thought about it: "I really want to kill. Let's take a few werewolves directly. Where is the prior notice? "So I decided to wait for it." Everyone began to praise the young man who calmly faced this situation and did not panic. He was the one who had seen the big scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc boss heard the noise coming in and asked: "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" We are discussing how to bury the body of this companion because we are really sad, so everyone is a little excited." Still only Fado is the most sorrowful tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc boss said with a strange nasal sound, "There are rules for corpses that must be handled by themselves to avoid any ethnic disputes. Buried or cremated." You look at it yourself. If you feel trouble, the training ground outside the city will buy about 30 pieces of copper in this period of time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Thank you very much." The old thief nodded and promised to wait for the half-orc boss to refer to the body of the one-eyed dragon when he left. "You who sent him to sell the money himself." But no one cares about him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa walked out of the hotel. He is not calm and calm about such a situation, but the brain is completely filled with more private and beautiful things. There is no room for other ideas to be inserted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems as if she still smells her breath. It seems to be just a wonderful touch on her face and her voice is looming. All his feelings are still stuck at that moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very subtle strange feeling began to grow from nothing when he joined his trip. Unconsciously, I have become accustomed to being with her every day. Unconsciously, her voice and smile have become a natural part of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time before the meal, he was completely drunk in such an atmosphere. So he didn't care about all the other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has never had experience with the opposite sex. When I was in my hometown, there wasn’t any woman of the same age as this animal. I only knew that fighting and fighting in the wild seemed to never take a bath and never have to wear a good dress. He was also immersed in his dreams and exercise all day long, and spent his youth in an almost ascetic way, consuming all his energy in endless exercise and fights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called love between men and women is at most in the mouth of the bard and the mouth of the pub drunk miners heard a too noble abstraction difficult to understand another It’s too real that the real knife can’t be understood by people who haven’t experienced it. He never even thought that he would experience this. As for the current situation, he is not sure what is going on. It is only natural to immerse in such feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking in the streets of Oufu is like being in the forest of a rock fortress. The buildings here are probably built according to the huge size of the ogre, and the height and width of the rock, which is not modified by the rock itself, is strong enough even if the momentum is not magnificent. But in the eyes of Asa now it seems that this is the most tasteful building in the world. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now great walkers who can see the big walks in the afternoon. They mostly carry goods or push special construction tools to talk to each other from time to time. . There was a sound of iron knocking in the house next to the street, as well as the sound of shaved wood and even textile. The city has invited humans and dwarf craftsmen from various industries to teach the orcs various manufacturing techniques. The city is full of life and taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa also feels that she has got the nascent energy. Even the weird orcs are now so pleasing to the eye. He has never felt such a wonderful taste that the whole world has changed because of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coming to a market not far from the hotel. This is a big place for foreign businessmen and dwarves to trade their goods here. During the time they stayed here, more and more people and dwarves from other countries came here to trade. It is full of goods from all over the world. There is almost no difference between the market and the market in human society. The screaming of the bargaining sounds and the collision of the goods are mixed together to form a very dynamic atmosphere. After watching it for a long time, one of the green skins or the body of the hair is not so unsightly, and it is automatically mixed into this peaceful life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half a year ago, he saw such a fluffy giant holding a weapon and turning his companion into a pile of fuzzy flesh. The sound of the bones bursting in the flesh and blood. The scene of the flesh and blood visceral has often appeared in his sleep to wake him up. I have thought about it for a while and can't let them die so badly. But now he is very sweet in the palm of his hand to buy things in his heart, there is no such thing as the slightest tension to kill the abomination. Those things have long been squeezed into the clouds by the good mood of the present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fruit was returned to the hotel room. Xiao Yan was on the bed next to the window, just a few pieces of wood pieced together, and sorted her notes by light. After taking the fruit that Asa gave her, she smiled a little red and said: "Thank you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa does not know when she started to like to see her laughing. The eyes with the thin eyes and the thin lips on her round face were originally very gentle smiles as if they were happy all the time but until they saw her eyes cornering down a corner of the mouth. It turned out that this hidden smile is her true beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially now her face is also flushed and more beautiful. I don’t want to let other people at least let Asa get drunk. Because Asa vaguely knows that it is the look that appears for himself. He feels that he can die in this kind of eyes and blush right away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small cockroach eats the fruit and looks at his own notes and says, "Have you been here for a few days and wondered what strange place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What a strange place?" Asa did not feel at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you not think that the order here is completely inconsistent with the impressions of the orcs in the past? You must know that there are hundreds of years in the wasteland in the west of the empire. The human beings are killed and eaten by the orcs. But now they actually build cities like human beings to learn to make things and human trade. They also have their own laws and systems. You see today that the officials here are humans. Who is it? Can you concentrate these arrogant orcs and manage them in such order? Why are they doing this? Are you not curious about this? Don't want to know why?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not curious." Asa was never interested in these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiao Yan made a face to him. "I know you are definitely an idiot for these. Let me tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should also know that the location of the wild highlands is in the middle of the Big 6 Because the north side of the Sandefies mountain lizard swamp and the southern desert are difficult to cross the natural barrier relationship, the wild land has become an important business route between the surrounding countries. In fact, after the emperor team annihilated the orc tribe here It has been suggested that a city can be built on it. Building a city as a market in such a position would be of great benefit to the business economy of the surrounding countries and the city must be able to grow by business. But in the end, this plan It is still impossible to implement. It is too difficult to build a city out of thin air in such a remote land. It is even more important that the wasteland is surrounded by several countries and is not willing to Others built the city in such a place that was originally a public area, because that can be used as a springboard for military offense. So even the empire is The most powerful of these countries has not been able to violate public anger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only the orcs who are familiar with the living environment here can only be in such a short time. Building a city inside. But they have never been united or have any technology, so someone must lead them. The merchants and craftsmen we saw in the city these days are all in other countries around. The establishment time of this place is not long. Why are there so many businessmen from other countries coming here to trade? Even if the location is good, how can it be traded? It is convenient to know that it is a dangerous orc. The answer is very simple. It was originally built with them. It is hard to imagine that the countries that have always had conflicts will secretly cooperate with this kind of thing, so it is more likely that the force of the people must be the Chamber of Commerce."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chamber of Commerce is a group of civil society organizations similar to the Adventurers Guild is a group of businessmen who are earning more money for the common good. Because there are few things that are more powerful than ‘money’, the association’s ability to be a folk is never small or even affects the political situation. Because of the state system, the empire is a large family without such a thing that monopolizes most of the commercial trade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My guess must be correct!" Her twin-breasted eyebrows squeezed into the middle of the eyes, and there was a shimmering shimmering shimmering nose. The face is also slightly red, which is exactly what the voyager has now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
