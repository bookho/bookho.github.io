Although he is already extremely angry and sad, no matter how hard he works, his face can't be filled with the majesty and momentum that an emperor should have. It is more like an over-excited child. "There is also the hatred of Bishop Ronis, I must let the murderer pay the price. And the Necromancer Association will write to the church to ask them to support the empire of the 100,000 army must be what to razed to the ground!" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small sighed in secret. There is no need to guess the result of the national power to attack the Deva Valley attack. The argument for this kind of combat power is not the key to this kind of thing. To carry out an expedition that does not have any actual political interests by the power of the country, as long as it is a little bit sensible, the minister will not approve of this impulse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even if everyone is as sad and indignant as the young emperor, this plan is still only a plan. Except for the barbaric nomadic state, the war is only the last resort of politics and strategy. According to what he heard from Sandru and Asa, almost every Necromancer in the Descartes Valley plays a pivotal role in human society. Affecting a country's political and economic conditions and the diplomatic situation can easily make any war plan against them dead. Losing the Bishop of Ronis, no one has the ability and influence to have the determination and courage to gather all the forces to deal with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that she knows that all of this is actually caused by her father. She must not let this whole country pay for her father’s sins. cost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young emperor breathed a sigh of relief and said to Xiao Xiao: "You really didn't let you down. You know that you can never go and die." What is the collusion of the spirit guild."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your trust." Xiao Yan bowed his head and answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The head of Roland has told me all the reasons for the past and the future. I don’t think that the Duke and you are so good-hearted, you are willing to bear the burden. The prisoner was guilty of sin in order to seduce the traitor. Unfortunately, not only failed to bring the murderer to justice, but also the Duke’s adult... The head of Roland has said to the priest that the wish of the Duke of Mulak is to let you inherit his title and position. There is no such precedent before the empire, but this is the wish of the Dukes. The ministers have always appreciated your ability. There is no problem with the support of the heads of the army on behalf of the military ministers. There is no problem with you. It is not only that I am reassured by the people that I am more reassured that the Dukes will be pleased with the Spirit of Heaven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last tearful young emperor calmed his face with a comforting tone. Xiao Yan said. "I heard that your husband died in an accident.... I can see that you are a very strong person. The tears are flowing into your heart. Don't be too sad. Don't worry, the soul of the Duke will definitely go to heaven and the murderer. After all, they will be sanctioned by justice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Xiaoxuan bowed his head and answered quietly. It seems that it is indeed a sorrow hidden in the heart as the emperor fell. Strong person. In fact, in her heart, I really don't know if I should cry or laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two or three on the way to the palace to see the emperor’s official. She saw that she was very respectful to her, but the name was already 'Duke of the Duke' or ' Prime Minister's. She smiled and responded with a commensurate commensurate with these titles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I just don’t know where to reveal the little winds, but everyone knows that the military ministers’ support and the emperor’s trust and love for the sister are very likely to become The key to Huangfu is that her own savvy and ingenuity is no less than the father’s prime minister position. Even the court guards look at her eyes are also admiration and worship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A female prime minister who is only in his early 20s is not only unprecedented but also unprecedented. This is what she inherited from her father. Xiao Yan secretly smiled at himself without any sense of accomplishment. More responsibility and pressure. This is not a lucky one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A horse-drawn carriage at the palace gate is waiting for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car is a delicate and luxurious car and horse is also a good horse. Even the driver who drives the car is also a straight body with a straight waist. Even if the magnificent palace next to it is not squinting, just look at the face and look at the front of the front holding the reins as if he is alive just to drive. The quality of the people under the duke is well known in the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Mulak was stabbed for only two days but everything in the Duke’s house has returned to normal. The good qualities of the people and the strict requirements that the Duke had maintained before, made them not frustrated by the change of the master. Although Geffenhardt XVII had intended to bury the Duke of Mulak, the king of the world, but the two daughters of the Duke insisted on rejecting the good intentions of the emperor. The funeral was very calm and low-key, and it was very quick and even a little secret. There was no extra ritual to carry out the Duke’s pre-life style and everything was efficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiao Xiaogang just got off the coach and there is a next person to report: "Miss. The head of Roland and the ministers have sent the official documents to you." The study went. Also. The Faculty of Magic came to a pastor who said that there is a matter of confidentiality to discuss with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know it. You call him Study room." Xiao Yan nodded slightly and walked toward the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study is still the study of the Duke. Here is the deliberate encirclement of the three empty rooms around the secret office where the Duke handles the affairs. Even people without windows will never get close to it if there is no emergency. Xiao Yan walked into the study and saw the heavy documents accumulated on the desk sighed and went to the desk to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young pastor was also led by the next person to the study. The next person turned and left. The priest took the door with ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How? Everything in the palace is going well?" The priest took off his mask and revealed Asa’s slightly thin and well-defined face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? I haven’t been very clear about his arrangements in the School of Magic for the past two days. What kind of story is it?” Asa came. In front of the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The thrilling story of a great duke family and a dead spirit squad that sneaked into the kingdom. Reasonably connect the current situation with everything that was born before. Together, I used a lot of bridges in the knight's novel... After the vampire appeared in the hunting ground, the Duke adults suspected that the priest was secretly investigated because of some accidental clues. After many thrilling intrigues He may well be a spies sent by the Necromancer Society to the undercover church. Unfortunately, all this is just a reasonable suspicion and has never caught the evidence. Like all the twists and turns of the novel, the traitor fell in love with the daughter of the Duke’s adult... Xiao Xiao looked at Asa with a smile. "But this princess has a devout faith and a firm will not be tempted by evil. At this time, the spy finally reveals the true face of the sly. The vampire was originally his accomplices. He eliminated the vampire and saved the emperor. Because it is necessary to make a meritorious deed to approach the Bishop of Ronis. The spy smothered the bishop and escaped. The Duke of the Great regretted that he must take this traitor to justice. So he played a stage with his daughter. The realistic bitter planner wants to use the traitor's love for the princess to catch him. Everything is going well. Unfortunately, the last moment fell short of the traitor and killed the Duke and then ran away. The Duke was left behind to his daughter in dying. The last words hope that she can take over her work and continue to work for the empire. This is probably the case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed for a long time before sighing and sighing An odd bitter smile: "It's really a good story. Is this... really compiled by the head of Roland?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "How is it possible." Xiao Yan also smiled. "It was the head of Roland's confession to my sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's her? No wonder." Asa smiled and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And it’s better to tell her to tell her about the story than it is from the head of Roland and my mouth."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the emperor's child completely convinced? I think there will be flaws when it is carefully scrutinized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The man conquers the world woman to conquer the man." Xiao Xiao smiled. "This is what my sister said she looked at the book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The man who can be conquered is not a real man." Asa smiled and shook her head. "Whether it is conquered by a woman or something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you say is the real man?" Xiao Yan smiled at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." Asa shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But at least we don't need to be a real man as long as he believes. For people like him, it is more willing to obey than to spend the spirit to scrutinize the facts. I am in a mood to accept such a story. As long as he believes that there is more support from the head of Roland, all the circumstances are in the hands of the master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiao Xiao smiled. "Other people? Who? Other ministers? Your Majesty has already believed that they still dare not believe? The leader of Roland is obviously standing on my side. They are not fools who know what the letter does not believe. As for the ordinary people, they would not have To distinguish what is the intricate cause and effect, they just need to know simply what is a good person or what a bad person. So everything is fine. Just wait a few days after the ceremony and formalities, I completely inherited my father’s duke and The position of prime minister. This is what Roland’s head asked me to ask me to stand in my father’s position and stabilize the situation. I also think this is my responsibility.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa spit out his tongue and looked up and down again and again. "Then you are not the prime minister of the empire? Also the Duke.... Probably also considered to be one person under the 10,000?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good tiring Xiao Xiao sighed. "Your Majesty said that in order to prevent you from being an evil guy, come back to me and ask the Paladin to strengthen my protection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So that's it. The most capable and youngest of the empire and the most beautiful prime minister are so grandly and magnificently on the stage of history.” Asa remembered the novels that I had heard in previous stories. It seems that there will always be a similar discourse to express life. What is a major event that affects the future. "The book will definitely be written like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then it will also read: The most dangerous reward on the Big 6 is the most wanted criminal escaped from the king. Since then, all the mercenary organizations and bounty hunters of the Big 6 have been crazy for this person. Entering the age of what is hunting.” Xiao Xiao smiled and sighed. "In fact, this is really unfair to you. All the crimes are for you to bear the assassination of a famous bishop in the history of the Big Six to assassinate a prime minister who is dedicated to the country for the people. Later... maybe you are A big sinner who was reviled by 10,000 people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you just want them, you can swear. Anyway, I have a lot of meat on my body." Asa smiled I raised the mask in my hand. "Not only will not be less and there will be more such things. I will wear this kind of thing peeled off from the face of the dead at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although The head of Roland has promised to help him wash his charges at the right time. But even those who are no longer able to do things now can see that this is almost impossible. The prime minister will play the whole country and the emperor in the palm of his hand. This kind of thing can never be just for the sake of one's innocence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiao Xiao went to Asa and reached for the ring and grabbed him. He buried his head on his chest and whispered, "I'm sorry." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled and said: "This is strange when you have a place where I am sorry for me? I am doing this just because I have to do it myself." He took a small forehead and kissed it with a slight sigh. "Since everything is arranged here, I can safely go. I am actually coming to you for a farewell today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;小懿 looked up and looked amazed He asked: "So fast? You....not staying for two more days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General Gru has already sent a message to remind me that he said that I will not go again. He took the two-legged dragon to catch me. Unfortunately, I have been caught by the old man of Sandrona for the past two days and have no time to accompany you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sandru has now become a plain pastor in the School of Magic through the arrangement of the head of Roland. After calling Asa to the School of Magic in the past two days, he almost taught him about magic in the day and night. Asa asked him why he would stay in the School of Magic, Sandro, and sighed: "If Ronis is dead, I can't even leave. We stayed here together and actually guarded one thing. Or maybe he might I have been a pope for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Things? What?" Asked Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru’s eyes said: “In short, don’t bother with things that are not related to you,” he said, frowning. "There is still this matter, although it seems to have been solved now, but I always feel that there is something that is not quite right, so I can't go any more. If you want to go to the orc city, you must hurry up now. These two days Don't sleep, I will tell you something that you can't understand if you don't understand it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then in these two days, Asa is almost true. I didn't sleep. It was better for Sandro to say that his corpse used in the firearms was too shit. It was learned that Asa used almost all the magical force to catalyze the three bodies excavated from the graveyard. Don't use this magic in the future to avoid losing the face of Necromancer. Then there is no day and night to explain to him how to use the body magic and so on to make him dizzy. It was only this morning that a letter came to the School of Magic to find him. He was freed from Sandru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
