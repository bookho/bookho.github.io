			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horror of the dozens of arrowheads suddenly came to the end. There were dozens of giant poisonous insects summoned to drink the tree vines and flew toward the mountain Drew. The elves will not eliminate the hostility because of Assad. The huge corpse monster and the magical smell that has been released have already explained the identity of the old man. When the dark star has appeared, the Necromancer is no less important to the elves. Viper on the bird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge corpse monster's arm suddenly stretched out to the extent of the elf bow and arrow in front of Sandrud formed a huge barrier bow and arrow all shot On the corpse's arm and the summoned poisonous worms even fell to death under the huge corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The little girl told you to be easy to impulsively simple compatriots to stop. I am not here to cause trouble, of course, if you want me to force me to turn all of you into corpses I don't mind.” Shan Delu looked at Luya and said coldly that he had seen the girl in the different reactions of the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't act rashly." Luya greeted the elves around him. Of course, ten understand that continuing to attack is just a dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long have you not come to see me?" Asa looked at Sandru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Sandro’s face has a silk smile that is hard to come by. His current expression is not exaggerated and not humorous. It is like a kindness. The smile of the elders when they saw the children was only a bit of a bitter taste. "I know that you are still alive, I am very surprised...and a little happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s very unexpected? Have you always thought that I am dead?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru said with a sinking voice: "This is not a place to talk. Change places."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Still can't leave here..." Asa looked back at Gru on the altar. Almost all of the well water in the sun has been poured onto Gru. The black body of the body is slowly receding, but others still seem to be in a coma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are scrupulous about the guys who are coming here?" Sandrug glanced around, though the dense woods blocked his sight but he The feeling of the master is unstoppable. "It’s not good to kill them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa also feels that several people are coming here. It’s been hanging from him since leaving the Glorious Castle. The guy behind. Although there is no intention to get close to what to do, it has been hanging far behind. Asa did not have the heart to pay attention to them. He probably guessed what it was probably not useful for Lancelot to send them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, they probably can't do anything too lazy to talk about it. Come and talk." Asa jumped on the corpse monster's huge wings and opened with corpses The wind swelled up and the huge figure went up. His necromantic magic is basically derived from the professor of Sandru, the same body he can manipulate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient corpse of the height of the kilometer on the ancient tree of the war carries two people to stay. The high-altitude wind blew in the ears of two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I originally thought that even if the Dark Star is really unearthed, it must be someone who picked it up. Not only does I think that Ronis Vide Nina All of them think that it is the other people who know the end. Mainly, we did not think that the predictions of the Akibad adults will actually go wrong." Sandro smiled and shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa shook his head and sighed: "The prophecy was not to say that I or a specific person who was not referring to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well? What are you talking about?" Sandro glasses glimpsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You haven't seen Aier's mother-in-law...isn't I'm regina?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No. I... I don't want to see her." Shandrew shook his head. "You inexplicably mention what she is doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you must not know what is happening with Akibad’s prophecy? There are also dark stars. And the reason for the Necromancer..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is going on? Do you know?" Sandro's expression is getting more and more surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the ancient trees of war. Luya and the other elves looked up and looked up. The huge corpse monster looks like a bat. The well water of all the sun wells in the altar next to it has been poured onto the body of Gru. The dead black has completely faded from his body, but he still has his eyes closed and only a weak breath proves that he is still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?" asked the Elf Patrolman. She had already taken the black huge battle bow in her hand, but she didn't know if she should shoot it. If she rushed out, it would be a clear result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How else? Just wait." Luya sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly an elf panted and ran out and shouted: "Several people outside the Luya Elder Forest are approaching the person responsible for scouting here and say it seems to be the church." ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Luya stunned and turned and waved to the other elves. "The order is going to go all the way to prepare for this necromancer. You can deal with those who are outside the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, you are wrong, don't care about those people now. The enemy is the guy above." An old voice interrupted Luya's words. On the other side, Elder Lloyd also appeared on the top of the tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are you, Lord Lloyd..." Luya was stunned. Elder Lloyd did not come up by himself. He had already been as old as an old tree. To go faster, it was impossible for a person to directly resist him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that the elf is a tall, powerful man who is dressed in a knight’s armor. And there are more people coming to the war tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-altitude Sandru and Asadu did not notice the following changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru’s face is ugly. Asa never saw that he had such an ugly face. Maybe this is the ugliest face of his life. However, it’s just that the face is ugly and it’s a bit more calm than Asa’s surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought you would have a big temper after hearing this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I really want to fire. I haven’t had such a big fire in my life. I haven’t been so annoyed when Hamm counted me. But who can I go to? Akibad? Or the ancient elves? Or is it the damn dark star?” Sandro’s voice began to be very hot and even a lot of breathing, but it gradually subsided. After a moment of indifference, he was all tired and hoarse in his voice. "If I could still be fired before, but now the black star has been unearthed, everything has come to an end. Now I can finally calmly think about all the troubles before, but all the troubles are just the trouble we think we created." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Qing Qingming Gaoyuan, I have heard this for a lifetime and I know what it means at this time. I have been indulging in my own gains and losses, how can I understand standing in the world The sentiment outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since this is the case, what are you going to do?" Sandro asked Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Asa asked: "Are you coming to me because of this problem? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You already know? "Shandro was slightly surprised.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was incarcerated in the Glorious Castle and I knew they wanted to use me to destroy the Dark Star. After escaping from there, Lancelot sent several guys to hang behind me. This obvious movement still can't see you when I am a fool? At that time, in Guanghui Castle, they couldn't take me out of this and then slowly planed. It is naturally the best chance that I will be alone. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. I came from the Magic Academy and got the news from your prime minister. Probably that's it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? "Asa's eyebrows are slightly picking up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Magnus guys are trying to persuade you to die if you really don't listen to them. You can use force to force you to be the savior. "Shandu Yixing’s smile smiled. "I also specifically told you that it seems to be superfluous. But since you already know that you want to come, you already have a solution? What are you going to do? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
