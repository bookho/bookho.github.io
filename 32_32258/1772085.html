			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contest was officially started with a lively atmosphere that was enough to make the slowest worms on the roadside trees feel excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hero of the civilian heart wins the popular Rod Hart Knight with high swordsmanship and skills all the way through the road will be like a broken bamboo every time to win an unusually beautiful and relaxed. His extraordinary momentum and demeanor made the tsunami-like cheers that were originally called the tsunami. He successfully entered the finals in full compliance with the wishes of the masses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mighty team drove to the already crowded crowd in the square and immediately gave up a spacious passage. In the middle of the door of a luxurious carriage, all the people on the square opened their knees to welcome Bishop Ronis and the current emperor Geffenhardt XVII. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many members of the sergeant’s semi-private activities, the emperor’s mood will be very good, and it’s not a bad thing. It is time to please you. And the most close to the prime minister, his Majesty is naturally mixed in the meantime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Duke of Mulak did not come?" The prime minister looked around and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven’t seen the figure for a few days and should be busy with business. If it is really ready to change coach, he is most likely to replace Sander. General Sis. It is also necessary to prepare early. But this guy has lost a chance to please him. It can be said that there is no courage, huh, huh," answered the minister of the Elni family. "But if this time, the strongman can get the championship and have the opportunity to enter the military, then we don't have to rely too much on the guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nobility is very convinced that 'blood is thicker than water'. If they can, they can't wait for all the positions they can take. Even those who have to unite like the Duke of Mulak must use the marriage method to let the blood of their family flow in the blood of his descendants through such a way to make him a 'self.' It seems that only the existence of such a connection in the body is the foundation for building trust and solidarity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime minister frowned and nodded slightly. The Duke of Mulak has always been temperamental and good at doing things, but he does not like to play political means. But the prime minister has never liked this guy who seems to be very good at using it. Although he did not see any conspiracy or deliberate tricks, but probably because of the instincts of the strategist, he always felt that there was something wrong with this guy. And this person who actually hangs the noble name of the ‘Duke’ is actually very low-minded but climbs to the status of today by virtue of his ability and seemingly good luck. Although it has become a 'self", it is not worth giving too much trust and dependence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that this Knight named Rod Hart is related to the Duke, but the country seems to be too focused on the official business, and does not have a good grasp of this talent. Otherwise, it will not be bought by himself so easily. It’s a very risky move to buy this person this time. If things go out and the guys in the military grab the handle, that’s not a joke. The election of the Paladin as the central force of the empire is absolutely not to be vague. It would be a hassle if you fall into a crime of swaying the empire. The key is that the current situation has to be so dangerous. The bishop’s adult suddenly came out inexplicably and squeezed out the position of his son’s priest. If the war in the West is hit, it is a great opportunity to build military power as a political capital. That is the key to the success of this political struggle. So I was only satisfied with the risk of finding a chance to negotiate with the knight fortunately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor and the bishop and the head of the Roland team took the seat. The ministers of the princes also settled in the finals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one to play was the Sergey Knight. A muscular muscle is barely exposed outside the armor, and it seems that even the face is full of those muscles. The hand carries a big sword that is so lethal even if a cover is added. This style is very rare in the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the good voices of some of the ministers, the singer of the contestant is more of the roar of the people around. The evils of this nobleman are very bad among the people of Wangdu. In the past few years, it’s been a lot of things for Hu Zuofei. In recent years, it’s probably for today’s selection meeting. I’ve gathered at home and invited a lot of teachers to do all kinds of special training. This championship is a must. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the snoring, the Sergey knight screamed and screamed at the low-pitched crowd. This is a typical simple mind. It is probably that all the essences are used in that muscle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunderous cheers and applause were given to the heroes of this mass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt’s handsome and chic makes the sturdy squad of the squad seem to be created specifically for the sake of setting. Si Qiang stared at him and couldn’t immediately rush to smash the beautiful knight. Although he knew that it would be an opponent who would lose to himself in the game, but now he has a feeling of failure which makes his murderous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime minister screamed in his heart when he heard such cheers. These insignificant inferiors. In the bottom life of society, self-righteously rolling and unwilling to be controlled by power but unable to fight and resist, then believe that heroes who can fight against power can resist the genius of this social mechanism. But I don't know that anything in this society is determined by the upper forces that control power, including the passionate lifestyle of life. Even the heroes who have gathered their dreams have long had the power to arrange everything behind their backs. This power in the world is the only true hero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, this knight looks really good. It looks very handsome and very good." The Emperor’s Majesty also expressed a strong interest. "I also heard that he once smashed into an orc's lair and not only saved Ms. Mulak but also killed thousands of those barbaric beasts. It is a hero." It’s great to be a civilian. It’s a bit embarrassing to say that the emperor’s face is a bit strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geffenhardt 17th This year, a 20-year-old one fully illustrates that the character's face is soft and feminine. For this flying hero is still very I believe that I like it very much. This is not a suitable royal life for a person who is in control of a country. His mindset and ordinary young people are no different or even childish. When he was young, he still sneaked out of the palace and wanted to follow one. The allusion to the circus trip. And it is said that the night before actually sneaked to a casino in Wangdu to play and caused something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uncontrollable origin and situation made him have to sit on the position of the king of the country. But he is not interested in these and just likes to indulge in some gadgets. In the fun, the political and military is regarded as an innocent disaster-like burden, and he is arrogantly arrogant to the prime minister who is very enthusiastic to solve his problems. So the Elni family will turn over in the middle of the cloud. . If it were not for the imperial court and the military, the old loyalists and the Paladins were guarding the Geffhardt family. This emperor had already given way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" 陛英英. Since you all know that this is an individual, then I will bet on the next bet. This young man must win ten gold coins. I don't know which one. One dare to come to the bureau?" The prime minister took the opportunity to look at the surrounding ministers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one should gamble on the military’s people and ignore them and the acquaintances know that he must be playing tricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Sergeker is like a nephew of Ai Qing. It’s too pitiful for his uncle to be so optimistic. So let me Come and cheer for him. I bet he won ten gold coins." His Majesty the Emperor is very compassionate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will thank him for his gift. I hope that Qi Tianhongfu will bring him good luck."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I remember that if I gamble with Ai Qing, my luck is always very good." The Emperor’s majesty laughed innocently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game officially began with a sizzle. Around the stands and the people on the ground began to take advantage of Rod Hart's name. In this huge voice of support, Rod Hart began to gain the upper hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed and he really did not want to see this huge hope turned into a huge disappointment. He wanted to go back and just turned around and saw a big dwarf struggling in the crowd and squeezing into a man sitting on a low wall and licking his foot and said, "Give me the position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person with this good position obviously refuses to give up his privilege and says, "Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you want this." The dwarf's short fingers swayed with a silver coin. The man immediately succumbed to the fact that it was a very powerful argument that jumped from the low wall and offered his throne with respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few gnomes have such an imposing manner and there are no other dwarfs with such a big head and the same ugly duck voice. Asa squeezed and greeted him: "Hello, Bolugan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not a special envoy now calling me Asa." Asa walked under the low wall. "I am going to go back and I can't think of meeting you here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why go back? Is that friend who is not yours on the stage? Don't you want to see him win the championship? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa said with a slight smile: "Unfortunately I bet he will not win the championship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No?" Bolugan’s broom eyebrows wrinkled again. "How do I think he should win the championship, then we will bet a few small money. Anyway, I also placed his bet there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I don't want to win your money," Asa said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, I really want to win your money." The former Burqada local official licked his mouth and revealed a neat yellow fang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On-stage Rod Hart is attacking Slink with only one defense with a round of intensive fast sword. If it weren't for Sergek, he would have given himself a few blessings in the first place. Now the degree can already make him lie down. The highly hired magician finally succeeded in instilling in his mind a few basic magics under the power of a huge economy. He had to admit that this was a remarkable achievement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt did not have this treatment. He would not use any auxiliary magic but the tsunami-like cheers and cheers completely compensated for this. Missing. It seems that every time he attacks, he has the desire of supporters to make his opponents very difficult. But Sergek's skill is indeed quite weak. With the help of these magics, even if it is really positive, Rod Hart does not necessarily have a full chance of winning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the two is similar. This really seems to be a wonderful game. Even Asa couldn't see the two people's every move, one move, one flaw, and any flaws. He had to admit that Rod Hart was not only a knight's talent but also an actor's potential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skeek’s defense showed a little flaw. Rodhart slammed his face on the face of the danger of being hit by a giant sword. In the thunder of the thunder, the muscular knight became a gourd. When he climbed up, the nosebleeds had gone out with the fierce light in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infuriating with anger and pain, let Sergey scream like crazy and eagerly waved the giant sword to Rodhart. There is no doubt that he is killing a wave of the airflow that the giant sword is waving and even scratching the face of the audience. But this crazy attack, Rod Hart still does not lose his calm and retreat, and slowly evades and slowly retreats to the left side of the ring. Everyone can see that he is retaining his physical strength and such a crazy attack is definitely not going to last long. As long as the opponent's offensive is weak, he will immediately launch a counterattack. But Asa knows that such a counterattack will fail because of an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really a good show. The knights who are brave and brave succeeded in angering the opponents and letting their opponents lose their minds and arbitrarily attacking them with physical strength. But just as he was ready to fight back, his body suddenly lost control and was unfortunately hit and suffered some minor injuries and lost. It was only afterwards that there was a piece of wood on the floor that was loose. The Cavaliers would naturally lose their balance when they stepped on it. But there is no way that the result of the game can't be changed. Everyone can only sigh that the hero's luck is too bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa began to think that Rod Hart had the talent to write novels or scripts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sly sword wind, Rod Hart has retreated to the edge of the ring. Even the layman can see that Slink’s physical strength has begun to show signs of failure. The winning goal of the long-awaited hero is about to begin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in this exciting moment, the hero’s body suddenly lost its balance with a slight tilt. The wicked opponent will naturally not let go of such a good opportunity. The sword has a gust of wind blowing towards him. The exclamation of the audience was loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa was shocked. Although the giant sword is covered with a protective cover, such a powerful attack is enough to make a broken fracture or even fatal. This is not the opponent in the anger of acting beforehand. It is really the life of Rod Hart. He is too far from the ring, and there are too many middlemen. Even if he wants to stop, it is too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But completely out of his expectation that Rodhart’s waist suddenly softened and the entire upper body bent back and the body became an arc. The upper body has been suspended from the platform and the foot is still stepping on the platform. The sword that was terrible just wiped his abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
