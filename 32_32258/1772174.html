			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of elf archers are in the front dozens of meters where the bow is full of strings and the arrows are shining between the fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five intruders did not dare to move. The wizard's magic enchantment will be hidden in the back of the elves, and even the murderous is completely obscured. This round of volley shows the lack of actual combat experience in addition to the superior archery that shows the elves. In fact, as long as the ten-point arrow can make the opponent evade and shoot a round of arrows while avoiding the volley of the figure, you can definitely turn anyone into a hedgehog. No one wants the elves to make such a sniper in their own body, so they don't move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man did not move. Even the instant vindictive body is only a short time and the eyes can't be protected by vindictiveness. It is not much easier for the elf archer to shoot the eye than to shoot an elephant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t move, maybe they’re still looking at it. When the magic enchantment was burned, it also gave birth to a number of undulating dead trees that seemed ordinary and unpretentious. The huge body of up to ten meters waved the dead arm and slowly walked step by step. Some of the vines on the ground twisted like snakes and gradually gave birth to many spikes. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than a dozen tall sacred horns on the unicorns of the eldest arms. The sharp horns are flowing with magical light. No one is because of these animal foods. Grass suspects their danger and lethality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge snoring sounded on the head of the elf, a wasp that was bigger than Massachusetts, flying in the air and circling straight to see the scalp . The needle on the tail of the wasp is only a little bit exposed, although it is much smaller than the arrow on the elf's hand, but this thing can only be half-life if it is only tied to the finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking stupidly to deal with these things?* He is the mother of Hilika." Hilton stared at the dead tree and turned into a mutter. The fist sword in the hands of the company is also unstable. He knew that even if he had stabbed a thousand swords on this thing, it probably didn't work. The foot of this big trunk could put him flat like a mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is really so strangely magical with the arrows of the elves, even if you come to an army is absolutely not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please stop. We are friends." The man shouted again with his hands up. But this time it has turned from a surrender to a friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Friends? Nonsense. We don't have friends like you." A costume is more exotic. The elders should have a big drink and raise their hands. "The man has a heavy darkness. Kill it first..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was sent by Cedros." The man was almost screaming. A cry. The elder elder's hand stopped on the way to the whereabouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hilton and Jessica have a good eyesight to see the muscles of the elf archers on their hands because they just have to loose their hands and immediately tighten and bulge. A little bit of a blink of an eye, the hundred arrows shot out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Sedros? Is there any evidence? We didn't listen to him." The elder elder hesitated and looked at the man as if he was hesitant but that The cold light in the eyes is clear. "I warn you. It is a very special time. We can make mistakes and don't want to delay the time. You only have one chance to explain your identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hovering in the sky The giant wasp has lowered its height and more and more wasps fly from the forest to the black and pressure. They are gathered into a cloud-like cage. The roar of the place where the man’s head is more than ten meters is sounded like a thundercloud. Thunderstorm. This is the wasp that has been changed by the wizard's natural magic. This Thundercloud may not be as powerful as the Thundercloud, but the people who die below will definitely be a hundred times more likely to die than the Thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man thought about it and sighed and reached out and took a mask from his face and said: "Is Luya still here? She should remember that I put it She brought it out of the whispering of the whisper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves all made a small exclamation. That face was once all overwhelmed by them and it is said that all the countries of the church and the Big 6 also began to be wanted. The Presbyterian Church inexplicably gave up the wanted man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more surprising is that the old Bill and the old Druid are three. Druid still looks a little better. Bill's old man's mouse is an unprecedented slap in the face. He looks like a tarsier. Hilton’s chin was hanging like a chin. The throat-like geese-like voice and even the swords of the fists have left the shaking fingers of Feng’s face. At least in their dreams, they saw the owner who had been in contact with this face for dozens of times and laughed because they often dreamed of catching him alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, they are my people." The man turned to look at the three people and smiled. This smile is the opposite of the dead smile on the mask. It looks like a glacial thawing sun. "Do you say that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hilton looked at the man’s expression. Bill’s old man looked at the front elf archers, although their bows had already been released and the arrows had been laid down. But it’s only a matter of moments to re-tighten the arrows. Then the two sighed at the same time and then looked up and said to the man: "Of course you are the boss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid’s expression has disappeared and recovered. Pay honestly. Jessica licked the black, big eyes and looked at the man silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard the news that the thieves had to deal with the forests of Tula Leone during the trip, so I rushed to see them. These friends are also on the way. This magic scroll is just a small misunderstanding." The man smiled and approached the elder elder and said that Feng, probably other than himself, could not tell whether it was true or not. "We rushed into the thief gang on the way. Now they are probably ready to attack. We will come over and warn you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge explosion from the forest In the distance, the birds in the forest swept a large piece. The Elder Elder turned and stunned: "How is it possible? So soon?" They crossed the enchantment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It must be those thieves who are going to look over." The man waved his hand to the Hilton and went along with the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hilton Woods followed and ran a few steps to look up at the dead wood guards who were struggling with great steps. Turning his head and thinking, he asked more slyly and asked: "You don't feel that we are being pulled into a thief boat inexplicably...fuck..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "We...isn't it...thief?" Bill always replied breathlessly at the end. Then Druid, who was turned into a werewolf, pulled it over his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...I feel fucked...inexplicably..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the edge of the raging fire, the three ruined dead wood guards writhed in the fire. Like a dead old woman dancing like a few moves down to the ground and smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more dead wood guards on the ground, and there are more than a dozen black corpses. The scroll of this 'Hell Flame' is just right. The power of this fire system's top magical range is only a kill of the six dead wood guards activated by the wizard wizards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is no smug expression on Aisi’s face. Instead, crying and sulking. The scroll of this 'Hell Flame' was something that he took all the hardships from the Academy of Magic when he escaped from Einfast. As a life-saving amulet has been retained until now. I saw the dead wood guards summoned by the elves and the ones who stepped on the front of the thieves and the thieves took the things completely and the elf archers behind them could not do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay*..." A thief who guarded Aisisi next to him, half of his head from the shield, clearly saw the power of this magic just excited Shouted a half sentence and immediately fell back like a piece of wood. A feather arrow hits his eyelids until there is only a small arrow from the back of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After rushing up, another thief picked up the big shield in the hands of the undead companion and stood by Axis. Shields are big enough and heavy enough. Their mission is to protect the only deputy in the team that will use magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are continually thieves who have fallen to the ground but have no screams but are silently planted at one end. The arrows of the elves are usually the eyes of the human being shot into the head or through the knot. These places are not screaming, but there are also many thieves who protect the head and neck. But the feather arrows are accurately inserted through the two ribs from the chest and abdomen into the lungs and the heart. As long as the chest and abdomen are shot, it must be Through these two deadly organs. They fell down, though they didn’t die right away, but they didn’t scream, only the kind of snoring and convulsions of pigs that had been shed blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the elves' bows are just ordinary wooden bows. Their arm strength is usually not too big. But none of the second thief's wounded were dead and all died with one arrow. This is the incredible accuracy of the Elf Archers. The thieves have a full four hundred and they can't always keep their eyes and throat elves without a goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
