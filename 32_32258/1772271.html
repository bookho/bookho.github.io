			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the two airs closest to the bottom is lightly divided into two huge sickles underneath. Their bodies seem to be almost the same as paper folds. fragile. Incidentally, there are two air elements. The cloud-like body is divided into several pieces under the sickle and then swept away by the huge wind that has been swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What monster is this?" The masters, including Master Aiden, have seen it, but Master Aiden’s reaction is a lightning bolt. The past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning smoothly slammed into a huge green body and was immediately covered with electric sparks. But this huge insect did not carry the huge body shape like a winged Pegasus. It was only a little bit of a moment and immediately rushed to the master of Aiden with the agility and degree of insects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the rushing oncoming huge sickle, Eden’s master did not even have the courage to try his own instant thunder and violent bombs. The faster-running flight is flying like a frightened fly at a very small angle. He knew that he would never be able to survive such a huge monster attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge sickle of the scorpion is not far away, and the wind and the wind bring the face to hurt. Aiden master even can see the lines on the huge weapon. It doesn't even have to be this main killing weapon. The sharp barbs on the rest of the limbs are also chilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just with this mutant insect, the difference between a few meters and the enchantment of magic to prepare a thunderstorm, the master of Aiden, but now the cockroach has turned back came back. He had to go out again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that he can’t throw a thunderous bomb in such a short period of time. But he really didn't know how to kill this monster. Even the two horrible sickles can be blown up. As long as the huge body is still moving, the body has been stranded because of the cast. It’s not something he can stand by being hit by a hard-cut body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sneaking again, Master Aiden also has a female elf who is chasing after him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aiden Master can avoid the flight that does not mean that other divisions can also reach this peak. The two divisions just turned a little slower and screamed under the other two giant jaws. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the men who have just dealt with dozens of Pegasus knights are still non-destructive, and there are already four people who have lost their lives, and several other divisions are roaring or Throw out magic or summon the air element to attack these three giant monsters. But these things, despite their size, have completely kept the insects uniquely flexible. The two thunderous bombs simply couldn’t be hit, and the lightning in the middle of the squad seemed to have done nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two * divisions screaming and carrying their own air elements together under the sickle to be cut into pieces and the woman The elf's control is only constantly chasing the sharp winds that the two giant scythes of Aiden's masters constantly waved, and in no case let the most combative man stop for even a second. One big, one small, one green, one white and two shadows are constantly chasing each other in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three wars have completely reversed the situation in midair. The elves on the ground looked at the sigh of relief, and the magicians who had already begun to approach the ancient trees of war were angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several air* divisions screamed and fell into the sky. The man was cut into two halves by the waist, especially when he was very sharp and very divided into two. It was a half-body who couldn’t die for a while. He even kept some flying techniques like the broken bamboo shoots. Fluttering with blood and the internal organs of the abdomen fell in front of the group of magicians on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dropped to the ground. He looked at the companions around him and seemed to want to say something, but only a few clicks before he completely suffocated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quickly split half of the people to help." Several air system masters on the ground immediately summoned more than a dozen elements of more than 20 elements. The body that jumped on the temperament element smashed the arrow with the hurricane Aegis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of magicians on the ground has advanced to the position of hundreds of meters before the war tree. At the time, almost all the dead wood guards of the whole forest had gathered here. The three layers on the outside of the three floors surrounded the elemental giants and magicians. At this time, the elf archers around the dead wood guards are not hundreds but thousands. In addition, there are hundreds of unicorns trying hard to squeeze into the encirclement that is almost leaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
