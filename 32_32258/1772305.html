			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first time I saw the Lancelot Knight was more than a decade ago. The impression that the Paladin gave me was so profound that I saw it again today. It made me feel so excited." After walking over the seven knights of the temple, the eyes of the high priest Tima stopped on Lanlus. He spoke in addition to the hordes of the Tauren, which seemed to have nothing. The sharpness always makes people feel as if they are listening to a few people at the same time. "Because the promise given by Bishop Hamm is really good, some of you really have enough strength to complete our covenant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And these idiots are so What do you do more nonsense? How much he did not kill enough in the past?" A fiery violent mouth with a group of fireballs can be sent out at any time to blow the dead. Standing on the stone bench next to it is the basil. The eagle owl does not have the habit of sitting down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's not enough, isn't there you?" Wellske looked at the eagle and said coldly. Even sitting on the stone chair, his right hand still clasped the huge gold bow. There was a slight murderous temper on his face. He was one of the two Knights of the Temple who went out with Lancelot. Like Lancelot, he has been in a state of war that will erupt at any time after he has come to this underground world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, and you!" The eagle patriarch chief looked at Willske screaming. Her upper body is half naked, and she can be called a charming and flamboyant face and a half-baked female body, but now it looks like a hysterical shrew. But this does not seem to blame her for being too impulsive. Thousands of families were killed ten years ago under the golden warrior of the Knights of the Temple. "Do you know? In the past ten years, I have been tearing up the illusion all the time. When I killed the soldiers of the Erasia, I tried to imagine that it was you, telling you, seeing those guys is me. It’s more fun to do things than to make love.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple glared at her, and her eyes were full of bloodshot eyes. "I feel the most enjoyable time in my life. When I was killing the harpy in Nikon ten years ago, God was on it. Those flying in the air were really good shots. I didn't even use arrows. Just casually. With the bones picked up on the ground, the bodies can turn them into pieces of feathers that are full of heaven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roller made a sound that he didn’t know whether he was laughing or roaring. Scream: "Do you remember the old man ten years ago? The magician among you, his skull is now in my lair, I use his head to hold my feces. The knight around you. Her head is now air-dried, I forgot to bring you to see..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilska laughed, this laugh The sound seemed to be the roar of a lion, and the entire underground palace shook a bit. The red color in his eyes seemed to be bleeding, and the temperament of the temper was soaring. The golden warbow was lifted to the eagle demon chief on the opposite stone chair. Pulling the bow, no arrows, so close to the distance, this momentary violent anger and killing is enough to be an arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple from the bow to the loose hand is only half-blinking time, the light on the golden bow is flashing. A bang. Opposite enough, the Tauren sat in a huge stone chair and collapsed. Blasted. But there was no flesh and blood and feathers scattered. The Basil Thunder, which was originally on the top, had been dodging when the Knights of the Temple had pulled the bow. She was in midair, and the wings three meters wide behind it had begun. The anger rushed toward Wellscay. The huge eagle catch of the lower body of the harpy is already open. The power of this pair of giant claws is no worse than any raptor, and she already has two long knives on her hand, and the green is the curse of green and blue. Wellskey was not surprised. As early as ten years ago, he was very familiar with the agility and fighting style of these flying monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His string has been raised at the same time, this crystal arrow has been thrown. The arrow does not have to be bowed to shoot. And this arrow is small. However, the vindictiveness attached above also brought out the roar of the wind and thunder. Needless to say, it is the body of the eagle banshee. Even a tauren does not necessarily understand this. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while Willskai threw the arrow, the big priest of the Tauren in front of the table frowned and tapped with the huge fist The desktop is a bit. The tabletop, which was completely carved from a whole rock, suddenly shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken desktop is the one in front of Wellskey, and the fragmentation is very regular, that is, two square slabs are broken off the stone table. Flying up, just in front of the crystal arrow in front of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first slate hit a crack, the grudge on the crystal arrow was also exhausted, and then the broken slate and crystal arrow hit the first The two slabs together become pieces and fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And martial arts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harpy in the air is gone, but falls on a stone chair not far away. Nature is not where she is, but she is pressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot let go of the hand on the shoulder of Basil, and said nothing, just turned and walked back to his position. The face of the eagle banshee is even more ugly than Wellske. That crystal arrow she even had the confidence to avoid the key, but she just did not know how she would be directly pressed from mid-air by Lancelot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harpy in the air is no less flexible and faster than any kind of bird, and the reaction and combat power of the basil is more unlikely to be any bird. Compare it. In the face of this person who has no wings and no magic, she actually did not even have the slightest resistance, so she pressed the ground from midair. This is a hundred times more difficult than a sword to cut her, and it makes her more difficult to receive a hundred times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Lancelot turned away, she looked at Lancelot’s back like a knife, she herself did not dare to move . She only screamed at the big priest of the bull's head: "What kind of guy are you looking at? I told you earlier that human beings are the most unbelievable. And you seek help from the necromancers of Diya Valley." That is, the result is that people don't respond to you, but you listen to the cardinal and connect with Celeste. Do you forget that they are the deadly enemies of Nigan for hundreds of years?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no eternal enemy, just like there are no friends forever. You must remember this sentence. You must remember this sentence. Although it is human, I feel that I am wise. The population is very suitable.” The wording of the Tauren High Priest is more like an elegant gentleman. If you don't hear it, maybe no one can think of a Tauren who can talk like this instead of snarling. He didn't even look at Wellske even if he didn't even do anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Lancelot nodded. He knows that this sentence is for everyone. This Minotaur is not like a Minotaur, like a human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Open the door and say it." Lancelot stared faintly at the high priest's eyes like two bonfires. He really didn't have the patience to face the monsters that once killed you, and he knew that it was not necessary to be a guest. The Pope and the new Bishop of Hamm had to explain everything well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. I like it too, we are all very busy, don't waste time." The high priest showed a smile that was probably a smile. "My Majesty the Pope can take the initiative to contact me. I am really surprised. But this also proves the sincerity of His Majesty. So I believe in you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And all of you Strength, indeed, also makes people feel sincerity and confidence." Tema's high priest's eyes once again swept through the seven Knights of the Temple. Including Lancelot are four warriors, one archer and two magicians. This is definitely the most elite force in the church. He is not even sure that he can leave this group of people with force by the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you should also come up with a little sincerity, so that we believe it?" Lancelot said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good." The high priest turned and pointed to the huge god behind him, his voice shouting like a few Tauren. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can swear in front of the horned demon, I will abide by my promise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The high platform in the middle of the main hall has a huge god. Even under the faint glow of the surrounding gemstones, the gods still look a bit glaring, white and dazzling. It is a strange structure made up of numerous bone product structures. It looks disorganized, but with the fragile structure of the bones, this huge god can support up to ten meters. Several dry corpses hang from the four prominent spikes. Every bone on this shrine has been subjected to the magical baptism of the Taurens in the past, and there are still fresh sacrifices at regular intervals, so that the screams and screams of the sacrifices give the gods fresh vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high priest is screaming at the gods, shouting out the unique ritual language of the Tauren, and then shouting: "The Lord of the Great Evil Abyss, I The ancestors of our time, our God, your servant will swear in your name, honor, and evil, and I will abide by the covenants with these human beings. As long as they can help us accomplish the great cause, let the underground world belong to the horns together. Under the shadow, I will never let Nigan’s soldiers go to the land of the Guangming Church. The barbarians’ Tataglia will be our new battlefield, and we will also cross the swamp and defeat the one together. Oufu above the wild land."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
