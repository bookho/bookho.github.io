Collection ~ top * point * book city book friend whole ~ Liti ~ for six months before the big 6 most mysterious and darkest organization Descarte Valley, a Necromancer sorcerer of the Necromancer use conspiracy to pick up <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Light Church and the War before Oufu The Lord of the City of Oufu, Lord Sedros Magnus died all of their conspiracy and then they used the flute in the Glorious Castle<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ya Gu’s Dark Black Star’s hilt summons the legendary King of the Dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Glorious Castle was razed to the demise of the undead by the countless undead, and the dynasty of the dynasty was turned into the fifth of the dead. The Dark Star's <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword is ruled by death, the world is endangered, the countries give up the gaps of the past, and the hatred of the 6 most elite troops and countless warriors Together in the <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the Dragon Desert before the Descartes Valley, the fifth of the Necromancer was intercepted. After the war of the world, the Necromancer and the Necromancer were all eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what the poet’s voice is, then the hero is not enough to describe the war because no one knows the truth of the battle. No one can <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;survived in battle. Only the tragic and heroic battle marks left for the entire flying dragon desert and the ground around the hundreds of miles are almost turned over and tired.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The undamaged wreckage of the undead on the ground, the tens of thousands of brave tens used their own lives to lay out a path of flesh and blood to the king of the dead in the undead army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most central part of the battle should be the big 6 heroes and the king of the dead spirit where the ground is all unknown to the lava zone. Even the volcano was raised in the desert.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last and greatest cruel thing is that the victory of yesterday’s trace of the King of the Necromancer was wiped out by the darkness of the darkness of the Dark Star. All the sorrows <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traces of Zhuang have turned into obsidian forever in the land. Together with those remnants who did not have time to withdraw from the zone, they also turned into an obsidian statue in the area.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a very special statue in the middle of the black breath. The statue is a woman but not in combat or in light. Instead, praying with both hands in the sky<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sincere and determined expression is fixed on her face. Her posture seems to be holding something, but people are not present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the leader of the Ainfast Empire Paladin, the leader of the Roland Church of Light, the paladin Lancelot Oufudi, the god of war, Gru, these well-deserved heroes in the afternoon But in the end, they all found no trace of their left.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They did not leave their bodies in the final battle with the king of the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to some people in the left-behind Magic Academy, it seems that there should be an importantly unknown British stable male to participate in the battle. But who is he? In that battle, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how no one knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last elf and Ian Fast's joint search team found the Dark Star at the summit of the Deva Valley. Above a dark altar. The dark artifact without the hilt is quiet there.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground stands. According to the elves, this dark artifact is a large 6 dark atmosphere that cannot be completely eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new elders of the Elves have changed the ego’s past principles of escaping from the past. After mediating with Ian Fast, he announced the establishment of the Elven Kingdom centered on the whispering sorcerer and the Lord<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing in the Shadow Mountain Range to prevent anyone from using the Dark Artifact to make a big mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elite troops of all countries lost their lives. The pattern of the big gas injury and the big 6 is also disrupted, especially the bright church that the West 6 has been ignoring and controlling the situation of the big 6<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The glorious castle, which is known as the holy city, has also become a deadly place for all the red-collar churches to die. The new Pope Adela. I just accepted the predecessor's teachings<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnus’s life is going to complete the preparations for the undead and the war, and then at the same time as the undead war, he is now at the School of Magic. Sitting in the mausoleum against the Ronis.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop's grave died. After checking that the cause of death is actually aging, the function of the new pope in his thirties is the same as that of a centenarian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Adelaide Pope did not leave the cardinal bishop's senior priests all killed in this turbulent light church has existed in name only. The West Asian 6 countries lost <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going to the constraints that have been shrouded above has re-emerged as a truly ‘country’. Among them, the power of the most powerful Essarian Catherine Queen is unparalleled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the head of the Knights of the Kingdom, General Oling, did not participate in the old The Battle of the Undead has become the only master of the world. Although it is unlikely that it will be <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what is a war, but it is only a matter of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of Oufu in the wilderness is not the same as in other countries. It is not the elite troops but the almost all adult male orcs who sent out to fight the undead. Although <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore the human beings have earned their true respect for them, but for the otherwise sparsely populated Oufu, the loss of national power is devastating. Fortunately, Oufu and the elves have suffered the same loss.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tower of the lost tooth reached the alliance. The former city leader Cedros has already built Oufu well enough. It is also enough to perfect the new city owner, Bolugan, who used to be an amateur and his ability to be as good as the young orcs in the city. The prosperity is not out of reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of the Einfast Empire is slightly better but it is only a little better. The most military power of the empire, the Paladin and the head of the sword, J. Saint Roland, all died. There is no such thing as a deadly <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the right to maintain the weak and incompetent young emperor only To pick up this burden, some small religious countries in the south also took the opportunity to let the empire have to give up some of the defenses and land in the south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has caused strangely. The female prime minister of the empire recognized that the most capable Duke of Mulak in the empire was also mysteriously missing in this war, otherwise the status quo of the empire would be much better. There is a rumor that the apprentices in the School of Magic in the Day of the Undead have seen a strange female swordsman in the swordsman of the Saints of the Ten Commandments. It seems to be the female of the Malak<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;爵. However, this kind of statement seems to be somewhat difficult to set. After all, there is no reason why a prime minister in a country has to go to the team to go to this deadly battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the history of the Big 6 has been smeared here with a strong turn and a new direction. This past. Whether it is a secret conspiracy or a vast warfare<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dou also hides the love and hate, and then the tragic and violent twists and turns, and then the hardships become the dust of the past. Leave the poems on the book scroll that record the poet population. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The easternmost port of the ice floe, Alnfast, is also the 6th most eastern port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time of half a year is not long, but there is almost no trace of the turmoil here. The war is far from the life of the civilians. There are hundreds of different kinds of docks in the port<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship-like ant-like dockers are busy moving the goods up and down. The noise of the sailors in the pubs in the streets of the streets is never going to stop. This<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several large sailboats in the harbor that can be seen in the harbor. No matter the big surprise size. Or the construction of the format and the big 6 of any country is not <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the huge sails there are some weird words and graphics that are from the distant Dongda 6 The merchant ships here are one of the ports they most often visit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up and down sailors are yellow-skinned Orientals using obscure words and language. They are all big 6 and are not common black and black eyes. People who heard about Dongda 6 are <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is such a single color and ochre. Only these Orientals have the most advanced shipbuilding techniques. It is possible to create a spice porcelain that can only cross the ocean and sell only precious <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The silk is exchanged for the gold nuggets and gems in a box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, another team of Eastern Caravans is ready to leave. The central square is painted with a huge square word that is the main ship piloted. The sailors above are busy quarreling.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an occasional curious look at the guest who is standing up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of guest is actually not very rare. On the 6th, there will be occasional explorers and tourists. The legendary distant East 6 is interested. Getting on their boat<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to the East is not the first time they have carried this kind of guest. [This time the guest looks very strange without the adventurers of the past and that Nachi and talkative hardly <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After talking to people, they only stood on the boat and quietly looked into the distance. And his strange place is not just this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship finally anchored a huge ship like a sail, then the west wind slowly drove off the port and bid farewell to the big 6. This guest finally looked back and looked deep. The face of the six places that were slowly leaving was indifferent. It’s not that kind of indifference, but it’s too much to settle down too much complexity to the extreme, but without any expression<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to be a young man in his twenties. It seems that it is because it is not completely confirmed that his face is densely covered with the person's scar and that he has only one hand<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left hand is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first time I went to the sea?" The captain came over and asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain is a white old man. This is the leader of this caravan. Although he seems to have sixty or seventy left, he is also very short in his body but he is very healthy. /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pace is very big. The bronzed face is always hung with the head but the smile that is not flattering is fluent in the 6 lingua franca. He held two cups in his hand<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; handed a message to a younger guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Thank you." The guest nodded and took the cup for a drink. He also has all kinds of cobweb-like cracks on his hands. He can look at his exposed skin all over the world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. This kind of scar is not like a weapon, but some cracks like cracks in porcelain or stone cracking all over the body make him look like a smashed and smashed together<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The muddy couple that looks together looks a bit horrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you ever had tea?" Some of the unexpected guests in the old age did not look like the first person to drink this drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." The guest nodded. His look is not cold, but it seems that even one more word is too lazy to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I can’t see it." The old captain looked at the young traveler with a smile and a smile. "This stuff is not cheap at your Big 6 price. But I can see that you are <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not a nobleman or a rich person."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrinkles are not too small but they are very respectful to the old captain. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old captain listened to the words of the strong man and then just smiled and waved his hand and said a few words. The strong man looked at the tourists and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My second son. I’m embarrassed to be embarrassed." The old captain turned his head and smiled at the passenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I still think I am an escaped desperate?" The young traveler smiled and asked. He can't understand the words of the East but he can understand the meaning of the strong man. This is why many people on the ship are opening.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for stopping him from boarding the ship is that there is no long thing and it is a disability and the old buyer’s consent is true. Not coming up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not." The old captain shook his head and said. "Even if it is also a good person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your eyes are very clear The old captain looked directly at the passenger's eyes. I smiled and sipped my tea. "We can see this when we talk in the East with an old saying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is this. I have been watching for 70 years. People can see that you are a good person and a good person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I mean the old saying. Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "This little boy knows the fate of the year is still not looking at people's eyes." The old captain looked at his back and smiled bitterly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know the destiny?" The passenger could not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s fifty years old to have a speech in our east. You can understand the fate when you are fifty. You can say in your words... It’s fate.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Destiny?” The passenger stunned the word to make his eyes blurred. "Do you also believe in fate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The word "enjoyed predictively is destined to be born" to explain that it seems somewhat biased. In fact, the original meaning is irresistible. The irresistible <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;failed to be born on himself." The old captain looking at his eyes did not answer but smiled and said, "I can see. You believe at least feel I have been there. It is only frivolous that people can only worry about this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I feel irresistible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passenger did not answer. I am immersed in the confusion brought by this word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fate. He is really so irresistible to touch so close. But why did that end up with such a result? I can survive and live the most.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has survived <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The raging black breath, though broken, is always so strong and strong, and the figure is rushing up and flying up to the ground to spray black paint.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sword kicked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade flies far and far with the endless black air. When flying into the Shadow Mountain, a sudden turn flies toward the looming peak and then The unique fluctuations are still <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down. But the figure has already disappeared after kicking this foot, but only to look back at him and say, "This is what I can do last time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This What I can do is great enough, but it seems that nothing is squirting with the broken hilt. It is still not something he can escape. He can only look up and look at the woman holding him and say weakly: "I'm sorry"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman shook her head and burst into tears but her eyes were all kind of Amazingly strong. She raised her hands to the white flames and sighed around the body. The sorrowful and firm voice began to shout: "The benevolent Lord, may you hear this most devout voice. I am willing to use your life as proof to ask you to lower your Mercy<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
