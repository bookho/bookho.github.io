			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thousands of human lives and one's life are more valuable. This comparison is not known even for idiots who don't count. So all of us are interested. Should it be confirmed?" Bolugan looked at the pale female prime minister and sighed. "I personally don't want this as well, but I can only make such choices under the logic and value measurement. I believe you must understand this too..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"And even if he disagrees with the Dark Horse's doomsday trial, it is also not as good as a hero, so you can persuade him."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advise? Advise him to die? Even a great hero is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the carriage of the young lady in the carriage of the Duke’s House is also a vaguely innumerable thing in the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only she knows best why he went to the whispering forest at that time. If she wants to say responsibility, she feels that this responsibility should be borne by herself. But unfortunately, there are many things in the world that are not just what you want. The leaf of the world tree has almost no fusion in her body. Elder Lloyd and the Pope have determined that only the body that blends the leaves of the tree and the sun well can succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot's subtle eyes when she spoke out, she saw it very clearly. What is impossible to forcefully arrest him is just to give himself the words of relaxation and wariness. As a leader of the politician, she is very clear about these tricks. She can guarantee that she will definitely discuss a plan to include her after she leaves. But she did not even resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is simple. She is not just a woman or the prime minister of this empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the idea that the people’s lives for the sake of the state has always supported her beliefs, but now she only feels tired and tired of being immersed in the heart of the marrow. Being crushed by these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't bother me, I have to calm down alone." She retired the guard and the clerk and she returned to the bedroom alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit for a while. She opened the closet and took out a set of clothes in the bottom of the room. This is a set of worn clothes, but it is very clean and the clothes are wrapped together with a very fine and fine Anka sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She picks up the sword. I feel that the sword handle that has not been touched for a long time has turned and volleyed to take out a beautiful sword flower. Until the forehead sweats slightly. She stopped to look at the clothes on the bed and gave her a long breath. The tattered ordinary adventurer suit looks so incomprehensible with the surrounding gorgeous, so that she can't help but want to change her clothes and leave here. No matter what the Empire is in danger...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knocking on the door suddenly sounded to awaken her from her meditation. She yelled at the door with anger: "Refused, did I not say that I would not bother me?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that really sorry?" The people outside the door not only did not retreat but instead opened the door and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it you?" Xiao Yan’s pupil suddenly raised his sword and raised his mind. She never imagined that she came in because of the Marquis of Hamm, and she did not even think of it because of the back of Hamm. Actually it is Sandro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t call the guards. It’s useless if they really want to do the guards. And at this time, the two that should have been swearing at the same time appear here at the same time and will never just want to deal with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two people who heard that the Dark Star has been born as a Necromancer should not appear here. Or are you coming to see me?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course there is something. Please tell me what happened in the Glorious Castle?" Inham looked at Xiaoyan. At this moment, his seemingly anxious head and his clothes are also messy and unpretentious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is also used to say that your Necromancer's artifact Dark Star has finally been picked up." The prime minister answered and her heart was also fast calculating . Now the king of the dead has already appeared. The identity of these two as necromancers is undoubtedly how the enemy should cope with how to find a way to inform the head of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak it out. Little girl. He has already asked a lot of people in this way. It’s a pity that even those who escaped from the Glorious Castle can’t seem to see who the man holding the hilt is. Just know at least It’s not the one I am worried about...” Sandro looked much easier than Hamm. "But I am also very curious to think that Lancelot and Magnus should be clear? It is only a matter of trouble if we ask, so only you can tell us."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;小懿 sighed and looked straight at the Marquis faintly said: "It is your son."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What..." Inham The voice is shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations to you as the king of the Necromancer is your son. At least Magnus and Lancelot told me that I thought of it. There is no reason for them to lie to me at this point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What...how could it..." Because Hamm not only shook his body and began to shake. It’s not that he didn’t understand his eyes. He kept looking at the little mouth and even the most subtle muscle changes. He could see that every syllable’s composition was shocked and understood. The most important thing is that this answer is actually in his heart. It is already faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Javey did not use the transfer reel to go to Erasia, he had already had some unknown feelings and then did not escape from the Glorious Castle. Anyone who got out of Javy’s news because Harvey had already foreseen this result was just that he could hardly believe it. His own gargoyle approached the group of undead troops marching toward the Descarte Valley and commanded the eagle eye to approach it, but it goes without saying that it was made of Necromancer, and even he himself was almost smothered by the Dark Star. Wiped out reason. I have tried my best to hear the news that I have heard until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru frowned when he heard the news. He seemed to want to say something but still did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Hamm looked up and sighed with a tragedy and then bowed down, the tears that were already on the face, all the feelings that had just exploded, all disappeared and seemed to be from him. The rest of the eyes are all embarrassing. It was only between the breath that he seemed to be ten years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messy footsteps outside sounded close to a group of guards and rushed in to surround Sandru and the Marquis. When the two men broke in, they were already aware that many of the guards had drawn their swords and two magicians were preparing for the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ginger's robe you can't use it now, give it back to me." Sandrud said lightly. Because Hamm did not say that he had lost his robes that had been draped over his body and threw it at Sandro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you going to do now?" asked Sandru. The two did not look at the guards and swords around them as if they were all air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Hamm shook his head slightly or didn't talk, just pulled a transfer reel. The surrounding guards were ready to start in the same breath, but his eyes were still empty and weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not stop. Let him leave." Xiao Yan waved his hand. Even if she lost her mind, she didn't think that these guards could really deal with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue light dissipated as Hamm disappeared from the room. The guards stayed at the remaining Sandru and looked at the prime minister who was overwhelmed. They are not exactly mediocre at least feel that these two people are actually not what they can handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Shandrew, what else do you have?" Xiao Yan looked at Sandro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The little girl Pope and Lancelot come here to find you wanting to come and not just tell you that everyone is going to have a catastrophe. Even the elves are When I attended your meeting, I thought it was something to discuss. I was a bit curious about this." At this time, Sandru looked at the guards around him. "Call these people to roll."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;小懿 is silent and does not speak. The surrounding guards were even more nervous, but no one dared to make a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can probably guess even if you don't say it. You have to know that Magnus can't necessarily know how much I have. After all, I am the guardian hilt." For so many years." Shan Delu looked at Xiao Xiao and slowed down his voice. "Since I can come to you to ask you, you should also know what the reason is or don't lie to me because of Ham's sentence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
