Luya frowned and looked at Asa as a child, writing disappointment and unexpected expressions on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa patted her head and said with a smile: "I have important urgent things to rush back to the king. Not to mention the city of Cedros, you have seen him." It is the good friend of your elves, General Gru, who will be able to send you safely there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luya snorted and looked at this tall and thin It seems that the human man nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you rest assured that the leaves of the world tree and her will be handed over to me?" General Gru looked at Asa and asked faintly. His sculpted, cool-looking face has the utmost majesty at all times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled and said: "I really can't think of a safer bodyguard than you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Gru faintly said: "Bodyguard? Do you know what is the most important thing for bodyguards?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is trust." General Gru flashed in the eyes of General. "This is the gods that everyone dreams of. The last time I used it on you is a last resort. And our personal relationship seems to be no better than this. I first said that I just went to the Dwarf King to get rid of two when I passed here. A Necromancer. I never thought about helping you. Do you believe me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled and said: "If you really want It’s not a good idea to grab a shot. And I don’t think you will.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Feeling? Don’t you judge with your brain?” Gru The general still looked at him like that coldly. "Even if I am not interested, maybe Cedros will be interested in him as a magician. Even if we are not interested in such magical items, it may be useful to Oufu. Then we have to be interested even if we are not interested. Even if you still believe me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa frowned and thought of a sigh and looked at General Gru’s dark and calm voice: "I believe you." Because I have no other way than to believe in you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Gru didn't talk anymore but just looked at Asa coldly. The darkness of the scorpion does not show the slightest feelings like a pool of solidified ink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half a mile, the sculptural face finally had a little wave, although it seemed to be a little ridiculous, but the slender mouth corner pulled a little black and black. The eyes also twitched slightly. He handed a delivery reel from his arms to Asa. "This is the scroll of your king's transmission. It was originally your emperor who gave us the messenger of Oufu to let us go. If you are in a hurry, use this."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This thing is really too good. I am not able to catch up with it. This time is enough." Asa was pleased to take the reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey." Luya stood behind Asa and pulled his hand. "You see that this person himself can't believe why you still believe him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, trust is purely a feeling. Because I have played with him. I feel that he is not such a person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it so you believe me because I used to kill you?" General Gru looked at his face. The smile on the line was a little deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. Hahahaha..." Asa laughed. Holding the transfer reel in his hand, he looked at the gray sky in the basin. His mood has not been so happy for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conference room of Deya Valley. The two Necromancers are holding the arrogant Aiden master, who is now lying in the transmission magic circle. The entire right arm and half of the shoulder have completely disappeared from the thick and deep scar under the right rib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radiance of pure white magic floats on Master Eden. His gray face was finally a bit of a business with the dual effects of 'Breakfire Reborn' and 'God's Artefact'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not the damage that magic can do or the weapon. If the scar is moved to the left, he will definitely not come back. "A Necromancer looks carefully at the wound on Master Aiden." Now the blood has completely stopped and even the new granules begin to heal on the wound. The treatment of two almost top white magic can be enjoyed by the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only he is alone. I don't know what happened to Asri..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aisley is dead." Master Aiden is struggling Open your eyes and say dying. "We stopped the kid together in Karendo. He didn't know where a helper came from behind and attacked Esri..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What?" "What kind of person?" The Necromancers were amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I don't know what kind of person I didn't see." Master Eden took a lot of effort to say these words. The two members of the world's top magician, the Necromancer Association, were killed and left with a half life to escape. But even the opponent did not see this is a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Necromancer did not laugh. They are very clear about each other's strength. The atmosphere in the conference hall was unprecedentedly heavy. This is a group of people who believe in standing at the top of the world, but they are now able to deal with them like a dead insect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about the guy in Hamm?" Master Aiden glanced at the colleagues present. "Only he knows the kid. The helper and the kid are acquainted with each other. They never know each other. Why haven't you heard him say this? This guy yells at us too much." Speaking so much, Aiden Masters A few breaths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He has already killed Ronis." A Necromancer said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is alone?" The emotional excitement almost made Master Aiden faint. As early as twenty years ago, Ronis was already the master of white magic and air magic, and the first person in the church, and the former president of the former guild, Sandru, might not have to take all the people here. Have absolute certainty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course we also gave him some church and all kinds of preparations." The necromancer who helped Master Eden gave him another temporary Enhance your body's spells. "Although I don't know how he wants to do it, but because Ham wants to come, he won't do anything unsure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唉This time was born. So many turbulences and catastrophes..." The old Necromancer tried to cough and scream, and he thought he was about to cough up his lungs. "I really miss the time when Sandru and Ai Ruiruil are still here..." After a long while, he adjusted his breath and said slowly. "Maybe we should choose an agent president..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aiden’s face is ugly not just because of the injury. He knows that this position is probably not about him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa strode and trampled on the soft black soil. Breathing the air filled with coke and iron. Listening to the bang and the dwarf’s screaming in the pub<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never felt that the air was so beautiful and never felt the fog above his head. The sky is so beautiful. This is the sky he has lived for twenty years in the air for twenty years. In such a sky, it seems that any magical fluctuations in the air can not produce any conspiracy and it is impossible to grow in the human heart. Everything here is so peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the basin extended for a long time, I finally returned to the poor and ruined village, and the familiar scene finally appeared in front of me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shantou store, which is often visited, is still sandwiched between the grocery store and the armor shop. The two children who are buying things seem to be the miners of the village. It has grown a lot now. The blacksmith wife who has only one eye is still missing two bricks on the side of the well. I remember that one of them was fighting with others when he was ten years old. When the weapon broke the rogue head, the bricks were rotten. The old carpenter’s door that was not pleasing to the eye was still faintly visible with the big stone and even the urine that he often pissed on when he was a child. The old girl who asked to eat something closed the door or was missing a piece of wood...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am back." Asa shouted . The sound echoed under the misty sky. The villagers were surprised to see that this person had already recognized him. "Hey, the blacksmith's bastard son actually came back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of gold coins in the arms were shaking heavily. This is what he deliberately wanted for General Gru. The face of the old wooden man who showed his father in his mind was unremarkable. It seems that after the two concepts of honest man and blacksmith are clearly expressed, there is no more thing that can impress. But it’s the most affectionate face that has been raging outside for so long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The familiar house that finally came to the end of the village is already in sight. Asa is very incomparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place that should be intimate in this idea now seems so strange. The father's tools, placed under the grass shed, regardless of the wind and rain, did not see that the straw shed had collapsed. Most of the stove was also covered with moss due to the damp mist in the basin. It has not been used for a long time. The dust on the roof of the house has been broken. It shows that there has been no time for people to live here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa squatted in front of the door for a while before reaching for it. The door ‘ah’’ slammed open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still no room for the display of weapons in the house. It is still empty there. The table that was eaten was still in the corner, and the stool that my father had repaired was still placed under the table. The familiar and simple furniture was dusty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lonely cottage behind the village is leaning against the hillside. An old woman is sitting in front of the house reading a book. She has a brown long, thin face. I can see that she must be a rare beauty when she is young, but she has a temperament that is completely different from other women. While reading the book, she suddenly looked up and saw Asa running over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you back?" The old woman closed the book and stood up. "I know that if you have something, you must ask me to come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lodge is still as neat and tidy as Asa’s childhood memories. The monuments of adventure tourism are also placed in an orderly manner. Asa anxiously asked: "Aer's mother, my father, where did he go..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is dead." Aier's mother sat down on the chair and gently Reply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three words immediately blow up everything in the mind. Asa stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After you left, the mine came up. They said that you stole the iron ore from the mine. Your father did not say anything to sell all the goods in the house. I went to the smelter to work. The third day of the trip, when I poured the molten steel, I didn’t have a dead mouse. The rat was immediately blasted by molten steel and the molten steel splashed his eyes. Although the life is saved, but life can not take care of the people in the village to help the body, and the difference between the day and the day finally died two months ago. I went to see him, that is the long-term accumulation of illness can not cure "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How could this be..." Asa squatted down and hugged his head. He only felt that everything seemed to be stuffed and nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai's mother looked at him and sighed. Turn around and take a ring out of the drawer. "This is what your father left for you. Listen to him saying this is what was placed on you when you picked it up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say?" Asa's vagueness can still hear the earth-shattering weight of these words. "What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not your father's own. His wife has passed away. You were thrown at the entrance of the village one night. Your father is I picked you up.” Ai’s mother’s face and voice are as calm as each other, but every word makes Asa feel like a spin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father’s grave is not far from the village. Like his people, it is an ordinary and unforgettable piece of mound that will be forgotten. Even the tombstone is just a father's name. Because the people in the village believe that the escaped son will never come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa half a squat in front of the tomb touched the tomb and felt the muddy cold dead eyes closed without moving. Ai's mother-in-law stood behind him and watched him not talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time Asa finally whispered and said: "I have been looking forward to all the time and energy from the time I used to escape this ghost place. Finally I also I have escaped. But the outside world has made me very confused and I don't know what to do. Now I am going back to the original... What am I going to leave here..." His voice choked and could not continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai’s mother said softly: “I asked your father. Why should I help you leave this place? Your father said nothing to just let you be yourself. What you want to do. What you are doing now is what you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A lot of things I don't want....but no way...face I can't do anything about reality..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
