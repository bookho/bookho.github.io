			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa retreats and throws the black gems up, stepping back, letting the huge dragon claws blow a hurricane from their front, Grabbed the black gem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Finally found back to the pool, finally found it back..." Moriel's weak and angry voice echoed in the cave. Instead of paying attention to Asa, she moved her body to a corner of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This corner of the middle of the pile of gold coins, various treasures accumulated there into a hill, from the shape of it seems to be her place to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the treasures that have just filled the caves have been completely deformed and destroyed. Now, in the face of these treasures, Moriel is like a garbage that is in the way. The huge tail is swept away, and the gold coins and treasures are filled with caves, revealing a small altar hidden in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bent down, holding the black gem on the huge dragon claws and carefully installed it in the center of the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gemstones fell into the altar and the whole altar began to emit strange radiance and magical fluctuations, and Moriel’s body also had the same fluctuations, which seemed to resonate. . A strange mourning came from her dragon's mouth, and then her huge body began to tremble. In the green magical fluctuations, the magnificent majestic dragon body was deformed and shrunk like a dough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the green light flashed, the black dragon was gone, only a red-haired, tight-skinned woman stood before the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked at these changes with a stunned look. He felt that the magic used by Moriel seemed to be the natural magic of the elves in terms of volatility, but such strange and amazing effects need not be seen in the elves, and they have never heard of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not much to know about the most powerful creature in the continent. In fact, it’s not just him. There is hardly anyone on the mainland who knows too much about this ancient and huge creature. After all, her life is too long compared with human beings. The years she has experienced are even surpassing any of today’s The history of the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be able to have such a life. The intelligent life of such power cannot be understood by human beings. As far as your ants are concerned, mosquitoes can never understand the identity of human beings. Even if I directed Asa to come here, I was not very familiar with this dragon. She only saw this dragon when she came to Niki a long time ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahahaha..." This is not a human image of a man laughing at the head, a red hair like a rising fire. Jitter burning in laughter. The laughter is still the dull and thick laughter of the dragon, and the whole cave is shaken in this laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman turned. Go straight to Asa and walked over. Now there is no feeling of weakness in her body, face, and movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman came to Asa’s face, although she seems to be a little shorter than Asa, both in height and size. But Asa can clearly feel that she is looking up at her. This is the most original and original feeling. For the first time, her eyes went up and down and carefully scraped Asa again. Asa could feel her yellow pupils squinting everywhere, and the skin was wrinkled with layers of ripples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mollier suddenly smiled and said, "It’s strange, the guardian of this generation of dark will, the apostle of Akibad is actually such a lame magic. The sorcerer is regarded by the magician as the leaf of the world of the treasure. It is simply a pearl cast in your body." She also looked at the Helikica and Rodhart, who were not far away from the body of the Knights of the Temple. "If the Necromancer did not fall to the point where no one was, it would have made such two good knights. I am a bit curious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although It’s reasonable to find this thing. It’s also a matter of re-filling the seal, but I still said that I want to thank you. Counting you save me twice.” Moriel looked at Asa, that pair The yellow longan flashed a strange light. Her voice is now without the kindness that is deliberately pretending, all from the top down, majesty, contempt, and seems to be with some dissatisfaction. "Do you know, I have waited for you for more than ten years. The last time the Dark Guardian. The killer came here to be a decade ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The damn Akibad, the seal he left, is only unilaterally let the dark guardians of each generation check it out, leaving me with no way to find or inform you. In the past few years, the Black Elves should have sent a lot of people to the ground to find you. But there is no news at all. After all, the ground is not our territory. Our people can't even mix into the human society, but they have no ability to harden the flute. You are all guys who are used to sneaking..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excavation and noise outside the passage suddenly became bigger, and the outside of the Black Elf reinforcements finally opened the collapsed passage. In the footsteps, a group of black elves rushed to the mouth of the cave, and when they saw the figure of the red-haired woman, they all collapsed. "Great Moriel. You can be safe and sound. It is also the care of the dragon of the shadow. This is also a concern for my family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is going on outside? Was it a ghost of Tima’s stupid cow?” asked Moriel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Tima led all the Tauren to attack Othello, and several other families have already rushed to Othello for assistance. We know that they dare <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting an attack. There must be actions for you. So I came to assist you first..." A female black elf headed up and said that this is a family Mother. "Great Moriel, has your body been healed?" The black elf mother was already excited and tearful. Although she and all the black elves also saw that Asa and the other two sides around Moriel existed to be small, like no need to care about the ants next to the statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My body is ready. Tima dares to collude with the human church to deal with us. I will let the Tauren completely disappear from Nigan." Moriel Nodded and waved at the Black Elves. "You will leave to support Otto, and I will arrive soon after I finish the matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black elf quickly left. Moriel didn't seem to worry at all, but looked at Asa and asked: "All this is fortunate that you helped me fill this seal... but I am very curious, where did you find this sealed dragon's blood? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed and replied: "The remains of a black elf friend..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Your black elf friend? Is it on the surface?" Morrill's voice was amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. She is a friend of mine...just I never heard her mention this, I just accidentally from her <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Morial roared, huge The sound waves are emanating from her mouth, oscillating the cave, and it is unbelievable to hear the most implication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which family is it? She dared to carry the whole family, betrayed the shadow dragon, stole my things and fled to the surface? Impossible, a black <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can an elf betray his family and beliefs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm sure this is certain It’s a ghost of Tima, otherwise he definitely has no guts to launch this rebellion. My seal has lost physical strength<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only a few masters know But how can the black elf be bought by the Tauren? What is she for? Faith? Desire? Can the Tauren give it to her? Money? No black elf will be interested in this. What else? Is it still? Feelings, freedom, these boring things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asam. He recalled the dialogue between Jessica and the Knights of the Temple in the forests of Tula, although not many, but he vaguely guessed <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reason. He was a little silent, and sighed and said to Moriel, "Enough, you don't have to talk nonsense with me. Go to support your people, our things can be said later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no later, you must make it clear and solve it now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well?" Asa stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Compared to the outside situation, it is still much more important between the two of us. It must be resolved as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter between us?" Asa renewed. The hilt of the Dark Star is already in your own hands, and even this is not going to be too urgent. And listening to the words from Moriel seems to be that she is looking for herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mollier looked up at the frozen hole at the top of the cave, then looked down at Asa and said, "Akibad told me, from The person who comes in this way must be the one who has already cultivated the meditation he left behind. Is this the case?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
