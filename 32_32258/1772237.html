			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head of Rolande slammed Shandru on his shoulders and ran Geffenhardt XVII. He was also pulled by his back. Panting and screaming, there is no such thing as an emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is originally a secluded location away from the town, and a large area around it has been insulted with the Necromancer magic and vertical and horizontal The swordsmanship is so riddled with the wilderness, and the horrible atmosphere of the huge corpse is all away from the band. It seems to be a desert-like death. And Rolander took one and pulled one to fly on this dead land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please, can you slow down? You don’t know how to respect the elderly... Actually use this method to frame me... Needless to say, it must be Aiden’s mouth. The little guy... He is miserable. I know that he must be miserable. He must not know the consequences of angering me. But it is serious and serious... I said you don’t jump, my bones can’t stand it...” Roland Sandru on the shoulder of Germany complained again. Although he himself said that he had broken at least fifty or sixty bones, it seems that the spirit of his constant self-speaking seems to break another fifty or sixty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to his own statement, for at least 30 years, he has not experienced the feeling of going to the door. Space magic seems to have never been used for attack and destruction. However, once it is used, the scope of damage is only a little bit of twisted space, but it is impossible to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was still not smashed into a pile of minced meat by this trap. It’s not his luck. It’s just that the transporting reel is a bad quality. It’s not that his high height can break the space distortion, but the effect of the space lock used by the three Necromancers has not completely dissipated. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scroll of the space lock is precious and rare. Sandro didn't think that the three of Aiden's masters had used this kind of thing in the previous battles. It was purely a lock-up space. He couldn't detect that Aiden himself did not take the initiative to remind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space lock time is actually not long. If Sander uses the transfer reel a few seconds later, it is just the moment of unfolding. The power of the broken space can turn him into a piece of meat. And when he unrolled the reel, it was the final stage in which the magic was disturbed. So there was a slight delay in the trap that immediately produced the effect. Unfortunately, he did not make an exception in time. Fortunately, in the end, the destructive power of the implosion was all radiated outside under the influence of the space lock, and only the eagle-shaped specimen that he sat on was cut into shreds. And he himself was just stunned by the scattered magical oscillations and fell directly from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for the leader of Roland to catch him in this ineffective transfer trap, he could turn him into a pile of rotten tomato-like patties. But even a person who is caught by the head of the Paladin to catch a high altitude of nearly a kilometer can not make it completely harmless. Although Roland used five methods in the air to unload the force and unloading force, but finally received the time when he heard the bones from the exhibition in the old man's body, and the sound of a hysterical scream. Roland's trick to pick him up did not let a broken bone stab into the deadly place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space oscillation did not break Sandro’s ** but gave his magical power to the impact. Not only did the corpse collapse. Even if you use treatment for yourself, there is no way. The head of Roland's reserve is excellent in swordsmanship. But he wouldn't use any magic. He only lie on the ground until he barely condenses some magical power and then reluctantly picks up the broken bone one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, I said, don't you jump, can't you?" Shandru was sulking again. Although the bones have basically been picked up, it is impossible for them to walk as fast as they can. Even if the bumps are so intense, it is also a pain in the whole body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head of Roland did not answer. Still striding for the other one, I couldn’t hold Geffhardt, who was too tired. His face is now dignified like a frost. I heard that Sandru said that the true identity of the cardinal was the Necromancer and that the sneak attack on the emperor was completely out of him. Immediately after he picked up, he couldn’t move, and Andrew pulled up the emperor and left. . With his mind and experience, I naturally understand that the situation is not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Necromancer is doing what he wants in the kingdom. This is not only to make Roland a worry, but Geffenhardt has also become a headless fly. If you haven't witnessed the magical old man's incredible means to defeat the three necromancers by one person, he will not believe that the cardinal who can heal the queen is actually a notorious necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandro had always been unreasonable. It seems that he was finally forced to be impatient. He suddenly replied: "Well, that chick is much more spiritual than you... now she has a pinch of death and you eat it." No problem, I will tell you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland heard the figure and immediately paused. Coughed. He seems to have vaguely felt something from the previous description of Sandru. Now I have listened to these words, although I can't fully understand them, but I also know about them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it weren’t for the idiot, how could I have the interest to talk to the kid about this nonsense?" Sandro snorted with disdain Geffenhardt said wickedly: "The kid looks at your waste and I am afraid I can't even take a heavier sword. If it is not for the benefit that Ronis has always supported you, there is still my ally anyway." Protecting you, I will make your little guy a living zombie so that you can drag people down and ask the annoying people who ask him... A man can’t even protect himself but he has to hurt others... I thought it was indecisive. The man hates it, and knows that you are more annoying like this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geffenhart heard a face, a green foot and a lieutenant almost fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he himself does not have any emperor shelves. It seems that I have already been accustomed to others to solve problems for him or even assume the responsibility of being an emperor. There is nothing to be conscious of being the master of a country. But after all, he is an emperor. These words are never possible to dare to tell him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Sander, let’s say a few words. You don’t have to ask these things when you are there." Rolander sighed. Finhardt also reached his shoulder and continued to run forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only way to get back to Wang Du as soon as possible is to re-create a flying corpse with the help of Sandru. But now I don't want to say that his magical power recovery problem is not even a creature, let alone the body. So now Roland can only run out of this ridiculous land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first swordsman of Dongda 6. The head of the Paladin. Now, like a coolie, two people are flying in a wasteland. And on the shoulders of the two, one is the 6th largest emperor emperor. One is the horrible Necromancer. This is definitely the most incredible and ridiculous scene, but no one can laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of the magical priest in the headquarters of the Knights of the Knights of the Knights reported the news of the escape of the prisoner to the cardinal who was discussing the matter with the Lord Rhodes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone is jailed?" The cardinal’s face changed instantly and he immediately asked, "What about the Marquis? Now where is he?"<br />< </br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Expanded the search.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Know you can retire first. Bishop Jia Wei’s face was swaying and waved for the priest to quit.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The Great Sorcerer? Is it the city owner of Oufu, Sedros? "Rodhardt asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible. According to the current situation of Oufu, Sedros could not have the time and energy to follow the guy coming here. The transfer magic array is now invalid and he is less likely to be transmitted. "Javie just thought about it and decided to deny this possibility." Retreat 10,000 steps and say that if you really need him to come here personally, there must be Gru. And if it’s Gru coming here... now we shouldn’t be able to stand here and talk. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he didn't say that he had such a helper when he was looking for me. He shouldn't hide it. Those who ambush you should be all of them. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Great Sorcerer...? Will Ryan’s old man be mistaken? Bishop Jia Wei frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although Ryan’s character is conservative and cautious but his eyes are still there, he has at least his reasons. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is nothing wrong with the fact that he doesn't know too much. I am strange... the Marquis... the grown-up...” Bishop Jia Wei said that when he was talking about the Marquis, he seemed to be indifferent to what he called. “How did he leave without a word? At least you should also be notified. However, this also shows that he saw some clues knowing what happened and knowing where he fled and there are two possibilities. One is that the matter is too urgent to notify me... I don’t want this possibility. Sex..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
