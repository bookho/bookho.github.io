			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white belly has been slowly lit up in the east, and the faint mist appeared on the grass in the forest, but this morning fog that should have been light and white Some scarlet, that is the color of the smoke from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grass around the transmission array has almost been drowned by blood. This is not one or two, nor is it that dozens of people can flow blood, it seems that it is not at the same time. The blood that flows out. In many places, the blood has solidified into a black block, and then the fresh blood covers it. The original lush grass has become a bloody sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no bodies and stumps soaked in the blood, the bodies are placed together in a very organized way, like a well-organized chef Like the dish, it has accumulated into a hill. The chef who made the masterpiece now is carrying the knife in his hand, looking at the two people in the transmission line with a calm and very wooden expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the 284th. When I seldom kill and boring, I am a little bored today. I want to know that it is simple. The action, doing the same two hundred times is really easy to get bored..." The Tamik Knight looked at the two faintly, his hand was holding an elf with a throat that had been cut open, bright red blood. From the slender neck of the elf elf, the bones rushed out, splashed into the grass and twitched in a strange posture. The facial features twisted almost to break, falling from the face, but he could not call any The sound is like a chicken that has been completely cut off from the neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouth of the elf’s neck is exactly the same as the ones of the hundreds of elves that are piled up there, all cut off the vocal cords together with the great arteries. A trace of excess muscle and skin is not hurt, just like the most sophisticated bread cut by a baker. The ground has been a group of blood sauce. But the black fangs had no trace of blood on the long knife, and it was as clean as new. With the knife, the Tamik Knight looks indifferent, and there seems to be a natural temperament and posture. Just like the legendary finger, you can suddenly explain the cow chef. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing on the hill where the corpse accumulates, at the foot is a small lake where blood condenses. He is not just a chef, but a massacre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large group of elves are not far away or are lying or sitting and dividing into large piles. It doesn't seem to be tied or bound. The prisoners of hundreds of elves here are all comatose. Then there is a bunch of blackened things not far away. From the shape, you can barely see that it is the body of more than a dozen elves that could not be shaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, take the leaf of the world tree and bring it. Right, and the thing that once sent a strange smell here, I know that. It must be on you." The voice of the Tamik Knight is not big, it is as plain as usual, and it is difficult to separate from each other by mixing a heavy smell of odor in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost just the voice of the Tamik Knight has just passed. Luya has come up with the leaves of the world tree. However, she did not go forward to the Tamik Knight, but in her hands. The green brilliance is like a lamp, and the magic power is like a raging spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great Marfa, your servant calls for divine power in your name, thorns prison." Looking at the blood of the corpse, Luya from the extreme The shock immediately turned into an extreme earthquake. With her loud mourning, the grass around the foot of the Knights of Tamik suddenly grew and exploded at an explosive speed. Originally just a weak grass, a tall thorny forest formed in the Thamik Knights. These thorns are not like thorns, but more like a hugely strange snake. They have just rolled into the middle of the Tamek knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely not a prisoner, but a huge meat grinder. The thorns of countless arm thickness are all spikes like steel nails, and With the force of these thorns, even if a cow is in the middle, it will be squeezed into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Tamik Knight is not a cow. The black fangs are as fast as a black lightning bolt, flashing around his body, and these python-like thorns are inseparable. After the slashing, the Tamek Knight’s expression was still not fluctuating. He just picked up a piece of thorns and threw it at a pile of lying elf prisoners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the fragmentation was small and very slight, but the next moment it rang, the pile of elves were swallowed up by the blazing fire pillars. This pillar of fire suddenly emerged from the ground like a fountain that had been backlogged for hundreds of years. Even the elves were screaming and they only burned their heads and burned together in this flame. This flame only burned for a moment and disappeared instantly, leaving only a blackened body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The templar was holding a long sword standing next to a group of elf captives. He is also as expressionless as his leader. When he reaches the middle-aged face, he does not have the exquisite spirit and imposing manner. He does not seem to have the style and demeanor that a master should have, and even looks old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with another templar who uses the magical eye, the Tamika Knights are not necessarily strong fighters, but play their part. It is higher than any master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say again, give me the leaves of the world tree and the things. Otherwise I will always kill, killing you willing to pay." Tamik The knight looked at the two coldly and turned and walked over to the elf prisoners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Useless, this is the sacred object of our elves, every elf has the psychological preparation for it, you can't threaten me. "Luya's eyes are full of bloodshot eyes. This sentence makes her use a tooth in a syllable and a syllable to collapse." The threat of the Knights of Tamik seems to be nothing compared to the threat of the whispering of the whispering singer, but the corpse of the mountain is piled in front of it, thick and bloody. She only felt that her blood was burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamik Knight did not pay attention to her, just reached out and grabbed an elf prisoner, another knife cut his throat. He is not a multi-speaker because he knows that what is expressed by action is more convincing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luya was shaking all over her body, and she suddenly jumped out of the stone platform outside the transmission. However, she did not go forward and fight with the Tamik Knight, but rushed to the direction of the ancient tree of war. She could not surrender the leaves of the world tree, but she must not see her compatriots being killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't move!" Just as Luya's figure changed, Asa suddenly spoke and reached for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the appearance of the transmission array, Asa was a bit weird after discovering the surrounding situation. He did not go forward and the Tamik Knights, hands Carrying the bag of magic scrolls that have just been searched from the Tower of the Tooth does not know how to use it, just standing there and not moving, just glance around. Knowing that Luya’s current shape was moving, he just seemed to wake up and suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luya’s body is still in the air, Asa’s hand has pulled her, but her toes have already touched the semi-solidified blood below. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overwhelming magical moment is filled with the space around the magical array. If the magic trap that just burned the elf was only a fountain that had been backed up for a hundred years, now it is a thousand years of quiet volcanoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not the fire, but the coldness of the bones, and this coldness is more fierce than the fire that burns people into coke. Not only does the moisture in the air condense in an instant, but even the air itself is solidifying and rigid, and it must become a solid to smash the people among them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting from the blood of Luya’s feet touching the ground, but one and a third of the blink of an eye, just after such a short time, a piece The huge white ice appeared on the large piece of blood, and wrapped everything including the magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'呛's a crisp sound, almost at the same time as this white ice formation, a black knife with a figure from this giant ice Breaking through the ice. Asa fell on the grass, and his whole body was covered with a thin layer of white ice, and there were several pieces of ice on the legs. Behind him, this huge ice cube is constantly chilling out, quickly attracting the moisture in the air to increase itself. Asa rushed out, landed, turned and looked at the past, the huge ice has become an iceberg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luya’s figure is completely solidified in the center of the ice of the hill, like an insect specimen trapped in huge amber. The nature trapped inside is also the leaf of the world tree, and the green brilliance extends from the leaves all around her body. Now that the iceberg is fully formed, the special ice that is condensed by the huge water magic power is as hard as iron. I am afraid that even Gru can't easily break open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa just did not have to look at the scenes in the iceberg because there are more important people to look at. No one dares to look at this Tamick Knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that if I take the initiative to trigger a trap, I will be amazed, so I will wait for you to trigger, but I still can’t help you. You still know Let go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
