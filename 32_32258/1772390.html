			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Hamm did not see anything wrong with this ‘son’. Although his observational feelings are absolutely the first in the first class, but he has already experienced several battles and the key to the exhaustion of energy and strength, he never thought that Stephen would dare to use Jia Wei. Another person replaced it and found it in such a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatal flaws are never physical or physical and psychological. Rhodehart feels that psychologically, the extraordinary person who has been strategizing and manipulating everything in his hand is like an undefended rabbit and a viper hidden in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even if the strength of Rhodes Hart is not weak now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order not to reveal the flaw, Stephen did make some modifications to his body, at least not because Hamm realized that he was completely the body of the Necromancer, for example, Some of the characteristics of 'still alive' such as pulse. So strictly speaking, he is now half-life and half-death. It is not only the Necromancer that also needs white magic to drive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the white light in the scepter was poured into his body, the incomparable vitality filled his body and listened to every place. The body that has been washed by the white magic has no slight rejection and completely absorbs this pure power. Like the previous Purdue beings, this is also a great manpower of manpower but it is more pure and more primitive. If the Purdue beings are so vast, this piece of water from the scepter is the water that the smoky sea condenses directly to supplement the body that is completely dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This body is combined with the strongest and most efficient parts of the big body. Now this huge and pure white magic has completely Complete. Even if there is no more important negativity to add, Rod Hart is sure that his combat power is definitely stronger than the still-lived peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Hamm turned away from the unprotected back, not far from him. Under this distance, he can cut off the foot of a fly with a sword and the fly can continue to fly and can also smash an elephant into pieces. In this case. At least 80% of his sneak attack has cut the ‘father’ from behind into two paragraphs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a well-known warrior Ranger who said that if you have a 60% grasp, you can go and let go. This sentence can definitely be called the motto of all ambitious and bloody young people. Rodhart is such a model among young people. After the eight places are grasped, once and for all, there is no need to disguise any fear of revealing any flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he still didn't do it. This thought is just a flash in my heart. The success that will come to the hand has not affected his reason until now. Even the danger of 20% is no longer worth the risk. The chances of allowing Inham to naturally make the situation above the square more chaotic will be even greater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when he disappeared after Hamm disappeared, he ran towards the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle on the square has already come close to the end. Gru from the beast crowd just knocked the paladin with a single blow and completely controlled the pope and others. In your own hands. Oufu seems to have won. Others are not present, but Rhodes Hart clearly sees that Hamm is slowly mourning the mantra for a maneuver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he expected, this is indeed a better opportunity. By the way of Hamm’s means, once the magic is out, whether it is Gru or Lancelot, the people he scruples can threaten him will never be threatened again. But Rodhart now doesn't care much about this. His attention is now completely attracted to the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attracting him is something in the Great Hall of Light. Although he did not know what was there, he knew that there was what he wanted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the beginning. This fluctuation is simply to make the body of his Necromancer feel attractive. Until it is close to here, from every inch of skin to the thoughts and souls all feel this fluctuation. He seems to have been induced by this feeling all the time. From the fact that he was still unable to move his heart, he only repeated the belief repeatedly, and he had already coincided with another idea filled in the air of the Glorious Castle. The most fundamental reason why he did not kill Hamm and came here is perhaps just for this <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this purely sensible thing is such a rationality to him. It seems that people are incredible. He also continually warned himself of the inexplicable feelings in the process of running here. There may be no practical significance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
