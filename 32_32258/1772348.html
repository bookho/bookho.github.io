			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celster’s prison guards are not too strict, in the middle of the church, surrounded by the top swordsmen and white magic There seems to be no need for further warning. So Asa and Ayimei didn't have much effort, they stunned the guards and entered here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cells that are side by side are mostly empty, only the innermost one has people, that is, Lancelot is trying to punish his disciples, so he puts Talis was held here to let her think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Assa appeared in front of Talis with Ai Mei, she did not seem to show much surprise, just watching coldly Asa said: "You really come? What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She now has no ordinary armor and armor But the white linen clothes that should be prison clothes are actually worn on her body. It seems to be very good. The shape and taste of a woman who is completely hidden under the armor of the armor can now be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, when I don’t look at it, Asa doesn’t even dare to look straight into her face. He reaches into his arms and takes out the delivery reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it is to save you from going out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be self-righteous, who wants you to come Save?" Talis's face was still cold and frosty. She looked at Ai Meimei, her eyes and tone were softer. "Sister, I am really sorry, my sister didn't take good care of you during this time. You can rest assured that the teacher has promised me. Just wait for this thing to pass, he will let you enter the sacred temple and become a member of Celeste. "...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sister, what are you talking about, let's go together." Ai Meimei looked at Talis in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't go. Where are you going? I can't go now." Talis shook her head and looked at Asa, the look in her eyes. It's very complicated, it seems a bit ridiculous, and there are more things that are inexplicable and more intense. She showed an equally complicated smile and shook her head. Some said awkwardly: "You shouldn't come here, you have to cast a net. Even if I don't call people to catch you now, you can't run."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The center of the Glorious Castle, in the Great Hall of Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large as a small square, the hall is empty, only the pope sits on the throne above the end of the head and closes his eyes. His peak is Lancelot. On a stone platform not far from the two, the pocket with the black-skinned hilt was lying quietly on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough... didn't go directly here." It seems that the pope in the falsehood suddenly blinked slightly, looked at the pocket in front of him and smiled. "According to the situation I got before, I thought he would really try his best to grab it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only one person? Your Majesty." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the old guys of Sandro and Ai Ruiruil are not interested in accompanying him to commit a crime... I don’t know if it’s good luck. Or are they lucky?” The Pope stood up from the seat and stroked. “It seems that he will not come to take the initiative to look for us. We should take the initiative to greet him.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quickly use the transfer reel. You go first." In the prison, Asa whispered to Ai Meimei. Although there seems to be no abnormality at the moment, his intuition always feels something wrong with Talis's attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Ai Yimei hesitated, Asa had already given her the prepared delivery reel, but she insisted on waiting for Tali. Silk rescued everyone to use together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quickly use!" Asa is almost already in trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer reel was pulled open in Ayimei’s hand, and the blue light of the space magic flashed out. But only flashed a bit. There was a burst of white magical fluctuations in the surrounding air, and the transmission magic was squeezed and dissipated. Ai Mei is still in the same place and has not been sent away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is this? This is...space lock?" Asa looked around in amazement. But even the perception of his true meditation is completely unaware of what kind of anomalies have been around. But even if it can prevent the transfer of magical space locks. It is also impossible to maintain a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a space lock, Celeste can be less expensive." With this voice, Lancelot appeared in the door of the prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Asa was even more surprised, and he was almost amazed to jump. It is not impossible to track him silently with a level of Lancelot, but it is impossible to track him until he is so close to the ground and suddenly reappears like a pop out of the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More unlikely, he also saw other people behind Lancelot, many other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't I said to you that you didn't come to the Glorious Castle?" With the old, but very smooth and soft voice, the Pope also After Lancelot went into the cell. "There is no space lock here, but there are people here, a lot of people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope is not tall, but as soon as he walks in and stands there, Asa has it. The illusion, the old man seems to be standing on a huge platform overlooking himself. Even Lancelot, who was much taller than him, didn't seem to look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Pope’s words, many people immediately appeared in Asa’s line of sight. The surrounding walls were broken, and dozens of templars removed the walls around the prison in a few efficient ways, leaving only the four corners supporting the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I have long wanted to see you, just wait until this time to have a chance, surrender." The Pope looked at Asa faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa has never seen this old man, but the faint momentum that emanates from him, the natural and self-satisfied temperament can be known, this must be white The old man is the present pope, Gevin Magnus.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa has no openings. He was not the first time he heard someone say "slowing down" to him. He had never been too concerned about this nonsense, but in this case it seems to be no nonsense. Dozens of templars, the high-ranking priests above are surrounded here, including three knights in Nigan and Lancelot, and Cardinal Adela is also present. Such an encirclement, surrender seems to be the only choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that I don’t know where to come from anger and injustice. Maybe nature is not a surrender character. The key is that he still has the capital to try. AsaLink I didn't think about the idea of ​​surrendering. He only moved another more practical idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the Glorious Castle, the ground on a mound was cracked not far away, and two figures emerged from the ground, immediately at a rapid speed Glittering in the castle. The swordsmen guards on the outer edge of the castle immediately discovered the two intruders and greeted the two men while alerting them. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are just two unarmed men, almost no clothes to wear, a tall and strong as a muscle fortress, one is much thinner. But those elite swordsmen are as fragile as paper in front of these two men, as long as they are on their way forward, they are all pulled by their empty hands, and the two men are also There is no intention to go to the slaughter, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just rushing toward the interior of the Glorious Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Rhodes Hart and Hilika. Although there is already a good plan, but in order to prevent Asa also brought these two fear knights, but they are too strong in the spirit of the dead spirit in the Glorious Castle is everywhere the pastor is impossible It was hidden, so I only buried them outside the city. Now it seems that such careful prevention is indeed necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the full-speed running cheetah does not have the speed of two Necromancers, the two undead creatures are flying here beyond the speed of any creature. Anyone who wants to resist the front and the building are smashed. On the way they rushed, the house collapsed, and the masonry limbs flew around, such as the two sailfish flying on the sea. The magician and the priest want to use magic, but the speed that can hardly be captured with the line of sight makes them completely unable to aim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the reason you don't want to surrender?" The Pope looked at the two Necromancers who had come across the road and smiled coldly. "Don't stop them, let them come here." His voice is not too big, but it echoes in the entire Glorious Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
