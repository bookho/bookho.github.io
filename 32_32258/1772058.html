			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first heard the snoring of his bones. The curved joints of the limbs are no longer able to support the muscles to force out only the surrounding branches are constantly squeezed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gap between every part of the body is gone and the surrounding pressure is still increasing. The blood in the body can't bear this kind of abuse. From the weak blood vessels in the nose, we find a breakthrough to escape the birth of the day and rush out from the inside. And the eyes seem to be encouraged to work hard to get rid of the constraints of the eye. The lungs have squeezed out the last bit of air and are trying to squeeze themselves out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have already felt that the deformation of your body has become more and more **. There is no room for any fighting spirit and perseverance in this situation. No matter how you think about how to move your hands and feet, it is still impossible to move there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pressure around the area is still increasing not only to the middle of the pressure, but also up and down. The musculoskeletal of the body has begun to feel the pain of heartbreaking. The brains of his body have seen the broken bodies of the soldiers he saw a few days ago. He knew that he would be like that soon. The hysterical fear immediately spreads like wildfire into every corner of the mind and blends with the pain. In the body, the left and right sides of the body gather all the energy that can work. The instinct of an animal's last struggle produces a fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is already late. Elder Clan saw that the hands of the dead wood guards had become a big ball of a branch. The squeaking of the branches and the squeaking squeaks in the silence of the forest. He stopped his foot in disappointment. Even the most robust bull was only broken bones and beef slices in the grinding disc of this branch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden and loud bang swayed the entire forest. The dead wood guards burst into a pile of hands and burst open. The burning branches flew around and there were two dead wood guards. The body burned together with the blazing flame to brighten the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa fell from the center of the explosion and fell heavily on the ground. But he immediately stood up again and slanted and continued to run forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Impossible." Elder Clan looked at the place where several dead wood guards wielded the arm that had disappeared and chased Asa who fled. This forest is shrouded by the power of the Sun Well. No one can use magic except for the elves who grow around the Sunwell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Asa who fled in front. When I just got up from the ground, I still stumbled. But after running a few steps, he showed a blue and white recovery magic light gradually and ran faster and even as fast as a fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Clan understood. Although he does not want to admit it, it is true that the human and the residual Sunwell power in the body have been merged. This not only allows him to use magic in the forest but also covers the entire forest to make his magic power more than double. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t let him escape with the leaves of the world tree. The hope that is the only confrontation with the darkness is the sacred mission of this noble race. No matter what means to stop him, even if he uses violence, he will not hesitate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Cran raised the bow and pulled an arrow from the back of the quiver. He bowed his arrow and pulled the chord arrow to start a blaze of fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bow full of string arrows has become a dazzling yellow light ball. Almost as soon as he gave his hand, the ball of light immediately turned into a yellow light that extended to the front of the Asa's vest running on the front, and the magical power contained in it immediately exploded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong explosion allowed the unicorns who were chasing him to retreat to the air and even knocked down a dead wood guard who was approaching. The man who was escaping was blown out like a dead leaf. But after landing, he only took a little gasp and jumped up and continued to run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at his own full blow, there was no effect. Elder Clan was shocked and angry and shouted out the words of the devil, which was completely noble and calm: "Give me a kill." He."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind screamed at the side of the ear and flew back. Asa almost has the urge to scream and dance. There are several dead wood guards coming in front. Asa did not hide from the open palm and stretched out to continue to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of fierce men bigger than his body gathered in front of the palm to form a burning heat wave as if to break through the forest's momentum and dare to The air blocking the front roared and rushed to the front of the dead wood guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the golden body in the body resonates with the whole forest. He clearly feels that the wave of the sun well in the distance is in the air of the forest. Each time the magic is used, the strong resonance of this wave increases the effect of magic by tens of times. The one that had just been licked on the back had caused him to be hurt badly, but the healing spells were used immediately and the dragons and tigers slammed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long arrow with a scream screamed past his ears and began to throw arrows. Asa quickly pulled the robes up to cover his head. The arrow shot at him like a raindrop and only ran for a dozen steps. He had already scored twenty or thirty arrows but the arrow could not penetrate the robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a hoof behind him, Asa turned and threw a fireball. In the sound of the explosion, the screams of the unicorns were blown up and flew up and the other all-exploded blasts rushed to the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wave of a fireball fluttering out to turn a dead wood guard on the side into a huge fireworks. In the explosion of his own explosions and the fire of the sky, he swayed the arrow rain that was behind him. He felt that he had almost become the master of the whole forest. Asa is almost looking forward to the emergence of new dead wood guarding the wood that once made him frightened and warlike now is as ugly as paper. He feels that he has never been so addicted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he still has to escape. He still dare not look back and expose his face to the shooting of the elves, and dare not wait for the dead wood of the entire forest. The guards all gathered. He still remembers the kind of shackles around the red robe people a few days ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance should be far from the edge of the forest. A wall of dozens of dead wood guards suddenly appeared in front of him. Although these wood plaques seem to have no thoughts, but a common sense of mutual understanding has gathered in the direction of his escape, it has formed an encirclement. And behind them, they can see the grass when he came in. Asa was almost happy to be called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you blow up the wood in front of you, you can escape. He waved and was a fireball. But this time the fireball was only half the size of the fire, but only the head of a dead wood guard was blown up, but the one next to it was still intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stood in the horror and he felt that the magical power that was still in the body was now showing signs of dryness. The fluctuations of the solar wells that permeate the air have weakened. In fact, the force of resonance with his far away from the sun well has been weakening, but he has been completely indifferent to his power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were dozens of unicorns behind the pause and immediately chased them up and spread around him. Probably afraid of accidentally injuring them, the elves also stopped archery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in this encirclement and swayed the sharp unicorn on his head as he watched the unicorn demonstration. These clever animals are not in a hurry to attack him. Carefully, he is surrounded by him at a distance of more than ten meters from him. They are waiting for the Elf Allies behind. The dead wood guards in the front began to approach this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can’t wait for the dead wood guards to step on their own meat patties and not wait for the elves to catch up. Even if they are old-fashioned and then stick to their violent culture, they will never give themselves any escape. Asa suddenly remembered the various ways of treating the escaped prisoners. The tendons of the hands and feet were cut and the chains were passed through the clavicle. Then they could only be in the dark and damp dungeon like a locust in this life. Creeping and other deaths<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly falling from the peak of the unbearable emotions, being surrounded by the inconsistency, he was panicked. The freedom that is already close to him makes his heart seem to have thousands of cats biting and catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grass is just a few tens of meters in front and has been flat reflecting the free moonlight. He knew from Luya's mouth that these dead wood guards were all dependent on the power of the sun well and could not walk out of the forest. As soon as the scope of this forest emerged, his hope of escaping increased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I get through this tens of meters? Asa carefully looked around and watched his unicorn vigilantly. He understood that the tricks used to cross these unicorns for the first time would no longer work. In this case, the kind of foot can be blinded again. The glare is equal to death, but it must not be closed to the dangerous unicorn with closed eyes. In front of it, there are dozens of dead wood guards who have now become tall and mighty to make him frightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor ghosts who are hungry and crazy are searching for their pockets in front of the bakery. Asa was so careful that he couldn't carefully raise every corner of his body, but no matter how hard he tried, he would only have the magic power of the two or three fireballs. It is impossible to blow up the dozens of dead wood guards, and I am afraid that these unicorns will not be able to deal with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
