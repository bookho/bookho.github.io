			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conference room of Descarte, until the end of the meeting, the late Adelaide Bishop brought a shock to all Necromancers. News: The Paladin and the School of Magic joined forces to kill a Necromancer who had been lurking in the kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the Necromancers are shocked is naturally because they all know who the Necromancer is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aydin Master looked at the Marquis’s plain eyes and voice already had some anger: "Inham. What is going on? You go Before, everyone should tell you that you should try not to involve Sandru.” He was dying a few days ago. He now looks like he’s awake enough to wake up and then take a hot shower. The spirit is extremely incomparable, and even the arm that has been lost has been reconnected. This kind of thing is definitely a magical myth in other places but it is nothing in the whistle valley. There are top white magicians who have studied the human body. The key to manipulating the corpse is the number of top magical items and magical items. Other things that may be worthwhile are everywhere here. The small thing of reattaching an arm to a member is a very natural benefit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis shook his head and replied succinctly: "I don't know if I am sorry about this. I will come back when Roones is finished." Everyone knows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oldest one in the Necromancer. He coughed a few times before he looked at the Marquis and asked, "Inham. We are very appreciative of your plan to kill Ronis... cough..." He said a paragraph immediately. Into a hard cough. The wrinkled face is flushed with the cough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one else quietly waited for the old man who seemed to cough up his lungs at any time. There is only a cough in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face coughed into a sauce red and finally got a breather after the cough turned into a pathological paleness. He gasped a few breaths slowly. Slowly finish the rest of the words: "We all appreciate you very much, but this is a bit of a problem. Please don't mind the disappointment of Master Aiden because there are some things that your young people don't understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Mr. Shante. I really don't know about this thing." The Marquis's expression was slightly stunned. No matter who he is, he can feel from his expression and tone that he is indeed Innocent. "I didn't think that the Duke of Mulak knew that Mr. Sander had even thought that he would bring troops to besiege Mr. Sander."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Necromancer Slowly said: "If there are people on the 6th who are not willing to provoke, then they are the two former guild presidents. When they withdraw from the guild, they agreed with us. But now if Shande If you really die because of us, Ai Greiner will never ignore it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please forgive my ignorance. Your predecessors. All of you here are here. It’s the 6th top magician, even if the other agent’s president will not ignore it...” The young Adela’s smile is very attractive and confident. He looks at the Necromancer who is here. "How can we treat us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Aiden replied faintly: "I can only say if Egnerel wants to kill me. I only have 乖乖Waiting for him to kill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are too exaggerated." Adela smiled and looked at him with a smile. "You can be considered one of the six most powerful magicians in any case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Aegrey is the top 6 of the Big 6 The killer and he used to be a member of us knows us very well. The magician also wants to eat and sleep, and the spirit will be relaxed. I don’t want to take a bite to check if there is a dozen or so The cursed poisonous insects don't want to spend a half day on every stool to check for deadly traps. They don't want to be afraid of never being awake before going to sleep every night." Master Aiden looked at Adela lightly. "If you don't believe that you can announce that it is actually Sandru that you bring people to kill. Then we are much more relaxed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, he is so Awesome." Adela still smiled. His smile looks a little girlish and shy. "It seems that we should pray that the other respected former acting president, Mr. Sandru, will be able to escape and die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That might not be More trouble." Another necromancer sighed. "Agrireel is just killing. Sandro is on fire...and nobody knows what he will be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is it possible?” Master Eden sneered. "Other people may not know, but the two of them are clear that we have always wanted to deal with Ronis. Just grab a guy who is accomplices with you, for example, the Duke knows all about it. I believe they have to ask questions." Absolutely no one can hide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No one is accomplices with me, and no one will know that it is actually a matter of arbitrage. Whoever does it?" How to reason and never put responsibility on us, please rest assured. I promise." The calm and watery voice of the Marquis and the confidence contained in the expression made it impossible for Master Aiden to refute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, good and trustworthy tone." Bishop Adela gave the Marquis a charming smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't know that these two predecessors had such courage. Now I finally understand." The Marquis also smiled and laughed as equally and fascinated. The taste is inside. "In the future, I will be more careful and pay more attention to these two seniors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the honor of Inham can be guaranteed. It seems that we are more concerned. "A neat lord who was very well-maintained and nodded." "But make sure that if I suggest that I am going to magnify the house of the Einfast Empire, don't go to the house and wait for anything to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Oh. It seems to have nothing to do with us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Don't go over it for a while. Wait until everything is clear."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But calm down and think about it, I feel a bit strange..." Master Eden shook his head indifferently. "Do you think Sandru will really be besieged and die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't believe it..." The old necromancer bent down and tried to cough It’s not easy to squeeze the words out of the body and look straight at Adela. "Have you seen it with your own eyes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I did not see the teacher of Shante." Bishop Adela nodded reverently to the old man who loves coughing. "But according to the report of the School of Magic, there were thousands of people at the scene. The first swordsman of the Einfast Empire led the 500 members of the Paladin and the Magic Academy almost wiped the ground to avenge the Bishop of Ronis. And participated in the siege. And this thousand people have seen the Necromancer finally exploding with the manipulative body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Self-explosive...so heroic The behavior is not in line with the respected Sandro's style." Master Aiden faintly looked at several other necromancers. Two of them smiled and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a trick for him to play. The Ghost of the Ghost can be in his hand. He is a magician who has practiced real meditation. Put on the Ghost King. After the robe, I don’t think it’s a thousand magicians who can’t cope with him.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh? Big effect?” Marquis asked a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must be the one who has practiced the real meditation to get the most out of that thing. But what about real meditation... Oh, please don’t dare to practice me. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adela smiled and asked: "What? Is that meditation difficult? I just heard it..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You young people are not very clear. The hills of the Shadow Mountain Range do not know how many of them have been blown up by the self-destruction of those who dare to explore the peak of the Necromancer spell in meditation. So our meditation room is only cut into the mountains at the end. Hehe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the record in the book should indeed be great for the magic of the dead. For so many years, only the former acting president Sandru and the respected Mr. Shante have been able to practice successfully. They have also become the most powerful necromancers after the reincarnation of Ajibad."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Success? Cough... I just had to stop when I opened my head. It’s still good for Sandu’s talent. Xi less than half. "Hills teacher shook his head hard. "And the last thing I regretted in my life was to practice the book..." His coughing voice grew louder and harder and the whole person twitched and his body was painfully shrunk in the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis sighed as he looked at the painful teacher of Shante: "It seems that Mr. Sandru took the real meditation and the gown of the Ghost King out of the valley. Maybe it is correct."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
