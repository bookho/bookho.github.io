			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa wakes up feeling that he is floating in the water. The strange and soft touch is over the body muscles and the skin is like the Ladora mushroom under the sun after the rain. It seems to be slow but it is incredibly fast. This feeling of lightness and softness finally stayed on the face. Slowly Asa felt the light and saw a green of all business. The green retreats and he sees the light, but now it is no longer the kind of blame that burns everything. The sun hangs in the sky as usual to sprinkle warm and harmless light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sat up from the water and saw that she was still in the sun well. Luya was taking the leaf of the world tree from her body. His body is shrouded in a layer of green light. A burst of harmonious and vigorous force is revolving around the body and the fluctuations of the sun well. The skin muscles that should have been burnt like a casserole are now intact. The land grows on the body as if everything had been born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and it was as if the last time Ved Nina had used the Dark Dragon’s method, the sun-well was already a scorched earth. Did not stay. The difference is that you can see the dense old trees outside the open space. But this time you can see that the whole whispering forest outside the forest seems to have become a ruined rag with only a few shards left. The thickest old trees are scattered all over the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about other elves?" Asa asked Luya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead." Luya looked at her face with all her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All are dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All died, not even a corpse is also The aftermath of the explosion shook into ash and didn't know where it was blown. The whispered sor... is gone.” Luya glanced at the empty, scorched earth around her eyes, all the empty sorrow seemed to have no strength. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you have become like this, don't be sad." Asa sighed. Although he himself thinks that the elves who are stupid to the extreme are self-defeating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing is sad. In fact, I felt this result when they refused my proposal. It is only a matter of time to believe in ruin. "But it." Lucia's eyes are still sad but not sad. After sorrow dispels other feelings, she has a strong strength hidden in the deepest. She whispered to Asa: "Are you busy with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I want to bring the leaves of the world tree to the forests of Tula Leone. Before the dead wood guards grow up again, they must find a place to protect it and I have to report to them. But I don't know the way." Transfer the reels back and forth. Take me there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This" Asa hesitated for a while while Rod Hart was important. But a completely unfeasible elf woman is undoubtedly more dangerous with a world tree that all the necromancers dream of. "Okay. Although I don't know where it is, but some people know that I will take you to Oufu to let the city of Cedros take you there." If there is a transfer scroll from the Academy of Magic in Cedros, then it is enough to come back. Wang Du's. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luya nodded and waved at him: "When you go out, I will use the well water to pour on the surrounding land so that the trees will slowly regenerate." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa just took the sun well and immediately got a very serious problem. He subconsciously jumped to the rock at the well and squatted. "Do you know where there are clothes and pants?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luya holds the leaves of the world tree and takes out the well water and said: "There are still those outside the body." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The local officials in Airy City almost collected the people who wrote in the city and made an article about singing and honouring adults. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial adult has not returned yet. According to the soldiers who fled back and the natural gods, the forest around it seems to be a hell of ghosts and ghosts. Then there was a fascinating image of the sky, and then there was a huge explosion that almost shattered the entire Ai Li. These are like the end of the world, and the adults are absolutely fierce. The guilty responsibility of being a local official is not to be ruined. Therefore, the local officials should explain as much as possible the dangers of the situation in the report created by the power of the city. How can the ordinary people be incompetent to help the adults to face the tens of thousands of mobs and calmly face the hell? How the heroes who rushed out were how to cover the innocent people and dealt with the evil monsters alone. The result was heroic sacrifice in the situation where no one could afford to return to the sky. The effect of this report should be very good. Many people fell into tears when they tried to read it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short-lived cockroach was immediately euphoric and washed away. As long as the imperial adult is safe, whoever is going to care about what he is doing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial adults rushed to explain the affairs of the aftermath. Even the command of the troops was thrown to the local officials as if they were throwing rubbish, as long as two fast horses and some travel items. Just out with the strange woman. As for where to go and what to do, he did not say it and even more local officials were not allowed to disclose anything about him to anyone. But then there was always someone who asked the local official about this bitter melon. It was like an old friend who understood the eccentric behavior of the imperial adult: "After experiencing so many great things, of course, you need to relax and relax and relieve the stress. And that kind of relaxation Naturally, I don't want other people to disturb." The listeners also recalled the beauty of the strange woman and then expressed her deep admiration for her envy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the night of the day they left, a group of people came to the whisper of the already scorn. They spent a lot of nights on the torch and carefully searched the wasteland that was still full of heat. It was not until the day began to light that they came out of this scorched earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a human body and wreck outside the forest. These things will probably make Airy's local officials busy for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of people looks like mercenaries. The time when Airy was not quite flat, the number of people who ate this bowl of rice increased. But even if they saw the scene of the tore-killing, they were now in the ocean of this corpse and only felt creepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But two figures are standing quietly on the body. A little bit of a peculiar shackle and desolation for the elderly, but a handsome middle-aged man standing on a body with only half body left but the posture is as if it is in a romantic place where the crown is gathered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that these two people’s faces are not easy, but not because of the endless bodies under their feet but the group of people who are approaching. They just waited for these searchers here for a night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of people walked to the two people and one of the heads of the person holding a small parcel and handed it forward to the two and said: "Two gentlemen It’s all the weird things we’re looking at inside.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man took the parcel and opened it filled with some weird little things Most are the unicorns of some beasts. He carefully searched and asked: "Have you found the well in the middle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader answered: "If you said carefully, look for it. But there are no bodies in it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man frowned and asked: "Did you see a green leaf?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not." The leader answered the secret and sneaked. This is the place where you can't leave nothing to say. Even if the leaves are rooted, you can't leave it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well?" The middle-aged man frowns from the things to find a handle-like thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the collar explained: "According to the magicians in our team, this should have been left by a very high-level magic scroll."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." The middle-aged man sighed. On both ends of the thing, two small tiny fluorescent lights were engraved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elderly probe came over and looked at a cold smile and said: "This accident has confirmed our inference. The evidence is conclusive. Let's go back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two gentlemen still have half of the rewards." The leader said coldly and touched the hilt of his waist. "And I have left everything in it. I see you let us come to this ghost place. I don't kill you in these things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The horn of the unicorn is a very rare magic item. This big pile can definitely be replaced with ten times the weight of gold coins. The mercenaries are desperate to fight for these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's right. Give them what they deserve." The old man said to the middle-aged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man stared at the group of murderous big men in front of him and began to read something that no one could understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
