			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is not too big and there are no complicated decorations and items. This is not needed here. Bishop Essell sat at his desk and looked at the accumulated volumes. These were all reports from the parishes of Erasia about the preparations for the Oufu War. Next to him is another red cardinal, Adela's young templar, who is repeating to them the things that the Knights of the Templar told him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Sandro...?" Adelaide wrinkled the pair of slender, pretty-looking, eyebrows like a woman, muttering suddenly Laugh at the Templar. "What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should not be the respected former president." The young Templar said politely to the two bishops. "From many places, this person should be the one that the seniors have been looking for."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aescher has not even looked up and expressionless Looking at the volume in his hand, he said absently: "Sandra wants to kill Talis. It doesn't cost much to kill a little hen. And he should have passed the kind of love. I was tempted to go to Elazia to make a fuss. Anyone can see that this is the kid we have been looking for. Adela means why this kid should report this name?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" The Templar thought for a moment. When he thought about it, he looked very good and looked very masculine and beautiful. His face brows slightly wrinkled and the blue of the sea was subtly deep. This expression is enough to fascinate most women. He smiled bitterly. "I don't quite understand. Is it because the Knight of Talis asked him? He answered it casually?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are too tender, huh." Bishop Della lightly clicked on the forehead of the Templar. His fingers are white and slender, and even a skin fold that doesn't look good is not even a woman. "If you can think as much as you think about your father, you will know that there is a reason for even a casual movement and language."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? What is the reason?" The Templar asked very modestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person's personality mentality at the time of the environment, these factors are affecting his 'casual'. In fact, in the true sense, those casual words and actions are only It is really exposing one's innermost things. It is far more real than the long story in his mouth or who's comment." Adela smiled and carefully guided the younger generations. "You should be more clear about this person's personality than we are. You think about his answer to his personality to explain his mentality?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Sandra should be his teacher... The relationship with him must be good... At that time, the name was reported casually... Is it fun..." The templar's brow wrinkled more and more tightly. Even the eyes slowly closed because of hard thinking. Indulging his eyes suddenly opened and there was a burst of light. "There is no 'spoof' mentality at all. He is not the kind of person who talks indiscriminately. And he is now the entire 6-year-old wanted criminals at any time, and he is still pretending to be arguing in each of the thieves who want to spend money. The move is considered after consideration in the heart. That is to say, he said it was intentional."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right. It is the son of Hamm." Adela smiled and glanced at the file and the Ascher also looked up and looked at the Templar. Nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Templar smiled a bit and said, "So what is the meaning of his sentence? Is it... planting?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I only praise you smart." Adela put his fingers. "Do you think this sentence is for whom to listen to? Is it Talis's simple-minded chick?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Templars immediately thought about it and smiled. . "He said that he would listen to a few of his predecessors. His sentence is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a matter of adding a snake. In fact, there are enough things to explain his identity. However, he deliberately added this sentence to reveal it. "Aischer looked at the file in his hand and sighed and explained all the meanings in this sentence clearly and plainly. "The only effect of this sentence is that he wants to express his identity to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this way, even Talis is deliberately let go. I have come to the letter." Adela also nodded. "The one who rescued her might be the helper of the kid, Talis, talking about this person? Grab it and ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those little sesames don't have to care. But the kid specifically told us what he would go to in Tulalon? Want to set a trap against us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Templar wants I want to say: "This is a bit complicated. It is said that he is rushing to a thief group to capture the elves to go to Tula..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogues Can you also capture the elves? Haha..." Adela laughed. "Can the thieves of the Tulalian forests be arbitrarily cracked? But the boundaries of several last elves* teachers who built them more than a hundred years ago, although not as whispered as we are and we The barrier created by the essence of heaven and earth is definitely a masterpiece of magic. Even if we want to crack it, it will take some effort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I heard that the thief group really The enchantment that cracked the elf also caught a few elves selling a lot of gold coins. So this time they gathered all the people to attack the boy in Tula, and this is the only one that I joined. I feel that these thieves might What we don't know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not the back of the hand." Aescher hit the inference for the Templar. "If this is the case, it can only explain that there is someone behind this thief group..." He frowned and thought about it. Coldly screamed. "Since the kid is mixed in, the one behind him must be the guy of Cedros. He has always been very good at magical use and has a fascination with the elves in Tula. Now the situation in Oufu is so tense. He was also distracted to work with this kid to make these famous halls invisible. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take us the bait to lead us to Tula Leone I don’t want to deal with us, I want to use us.” The red cardinal of Erazia frowned and showed a disdainful expression like a tea that was not so tasty. "Bad traps."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sedros has always been dripping without leaking this time but there are such big flaws that it may be that the kid is self-righteous." Adela finally concluded. An event that seems to be seamless and seems to be just an accident, under the inference of two people, gradually reveals the true colors. The templar's face showed admiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because there are so many things to understand. So the inference can only stop here." Adela sighed as if it was a bit embarrassing. "I have to admit that this trap is awkward. But it is still lethal. Because we really want to catch the kid and the self-respect as a member of the noble guild does not allow us to stop because of this botched trap..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Templar said: "This time the Knights of Lancelot grew up and let me go with Talsi and two Knights of the Temple to Oklahoma This thief group. Let me explore the road. Let's see the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three Knights of the Temple? Lancelot still cares very much. Responsible for his apprentice. But this lineup is probably no problem to deal with. The set of traps for dealing with noble guild members may be a bit reluctant." Adra looked cold and snorted. "Maybe that Oufu's bastard is waiting there. Don't do anything, if you want to come out, I don't want to tell your father. Then, as the boy wants to be the only one in the guild, I will follow it." Look at it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Templar: "But... this is clearly a trap..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Trap. Also see if he can afford it. I will naturally bring a bodyguard." Adela smiled at Ashur. "Do you want to make a comeback?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aescher waved his hand and sighed and said, "I am very busy. You go. Anyway, just grab the kid. You want the old roll to send Lancelot to be your bodyguard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then of course I want Against the guy. With Lancelot as a bodyguard. Unless..." Adela thought about it and smiled more tenderly than a woman. “There is nothing unless it is.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope’s Pope Magnus listened to the report of Bishop Ashur. Bishop Adela stood quietly beside the pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magnus sneaked a head. Two snow-white long eyebrows with a white face like a neat silver thread hanging on the face and not too old-fashioned and angry, a white-white pope robes. If he only looks at his appearance, he does not seem to be standing in his current Astellian majesty. But this may be the whole power of the entire 6 most powerful old people who no longer need any external power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let Zhuang Slotte deal with a group of thieves? Is it a big problem?" The Pope showed an incomprehensible smile and smiled as if someone had used the legendary gods to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not just a time to annihilate thieves. It is a time to establish prestige. It must be removed from the evil and the evil orc nest." The countries that started the battle felt that the Lord’s majesty increased their confidence. So this time it’s not a little bit lost. And it’s said that there are many evil infidels in the thieves’ gang. I’m afraid there’s a bigger enemy behind it, only Lancelot. The Cavaliers personally led the Knights of the Templar to plan to ensure that nothing was lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔..." The Pope hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty. Please let Lancelot go." Bishop Adela suddenly spoke. "And I think I want to go to Erasia with Lancelot again this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to do?" The Pope frowned and looked at him. A glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The other bishops are concentrating on spreading the glory of the Lord's glory throughout the day and night. I don't think I can do it in Celeste or go out and experience it. It is a good opportunity to help the knights deal with the pagans and there will be no poor people in the Lancelot adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope wants I thought about it. As soon as he frowned, the eyebrows that were sagged at the end of the pair made a knot in the middle. Finally, he sighed and nodded to Aschiel and said, "Well, do as you say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Esshir retired . The pope said to Adela: "You will go on. By the way, call Lancelot to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Adela Retire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don’t care what you and the Descartes guys are doing. I just want to remind you not to make a lot of noise." Adela just got out. At the time of the Pope's Office, Magnus suddenly said. Indifferent and casual, there is a bit of a friendly tone that seems to be a father who advises the child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adela's body slightly turned and bent over. Say: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after the Shrine Knight Lancelot came to the Pope Hall alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is only one well-known living legend in this world, then Lancelot is the only one. If there is a real paladin in this world. Then this title will definitely only fall on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting his life from his fifteen-year-old gun and sword, he became a lifelong story of a bard. Throughout his life, he was fighting for the light and hating to punish and defend the ignorance and perhaps the justice and kindness of Mount Tai. The thieves and evil forces that were annihilated in the West 6 before he was twenty-five years old were countless. After the age of twenty-five, he joined the church and became the battle between the Knights of the Temple and the monsters of the various infidels and Nigan. Ten years ago, in the biggest battle of the church and Nigen, he led the other ten Knights of the Temple and the Templars to directly into the underground world of Nigan, with dozens of people in the huge dark world. Kill countless monsters. Although in the end only he and the other two Knights of the Temple can give birth to dark areas. However, Nigan is also a big savage eagle banshee is almost uprooted in the past ten years, there is almost no other land move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is forty-five years old today. A strong brown face with scars can't cover up the original handsome silhouette. Every move reveals that a war of rhythm of the warrior has left countless scars on him, and he has concise him into a kind of person. artwork. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that the task of the Knights of Talis in Elazia has gone wrong?" asked the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The Knights of the Temple answered. "She has already reported the specific situation to me. Although she has made mistakes, there are actually several amazing pagans in the thieves. I have sent three Shrine Knights and the newly joined Templar. It should be enough for them to wipe out this group of infidels."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope seems to suddenly think of something: "The newly joined Templar... Does it seem to be called Jia Wei?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. It is recommended by the Admiral Adela."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
