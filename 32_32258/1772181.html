			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It fell to the ground and fell stunned. Asa was caught by Hilton and Jessica and dragged his head and ran into his head and slammed into the ground. It hurts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have seen the Necromancer using the numbness of the numbness, but he himself first felt the power of this magic. The volatility of the white magic is still gentle and pure, but in a strange way combined with the vitality flowing in the body, the vitality of the river like the Yangtze River is rigidified into a thick paste. gum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until now, he realized why the vitality of the behemoths would be as good as the second under the glaze. Within such a short distance, a cardinal has personally shot himself. Because of the shock, there is no dodging and defense. Even a Bianbi will have a few seconds of stiff bipedal dragons and wild cows. More long. And if a human being wants to break through this layer only by his own vitality and vitality, I am afraid that it will take half a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, it’s not a long time, it’s just half a minute. Asa immediately condenses into the state of meditation, which is condensed by white magic. Vitality is no longer a mass. He feels how the subtle magical fluctuations in the body are glued together with the veins of flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a small amount of vitality and vindictiveness in the lower abdomen. Just like capturing a cockroach in the paddy field, Asa struggled to control this unknowable temper that manipulated it from the lower abdomen and began to radiate upwards along the sensational veins and trails. The progress at the beginning is still very slow, but the more the shackles are unraveled, the more the vindictive and vitality that can be controlled continues to grow exponentially. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the magic tricks were finally broken. Asa stood up and broke hands and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss, you are awake. We are not opponents when we run those guys." Hilton looked at Asa’s face and smiled but panicked and did not lose his feet. . The first Druid who escaped has turned into a werewolf, and Bill's old man is flying against his shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I feel quite a bit in Asa’s consciousness, I actually fell off the tree after being paralyzed, but I didn’t even run out after a few breaths. Far away, the captain of the Shrine, who had just started chasing, looked at the figure who jumped from the ground and looked a little surprised. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few people who escaped were originally dying of running horses. Now they are using their strengths. But the three behind the white light are still approaching. The poses of the Knights of the Temple clearly seem to be just striding forward but they are faster than the desperate running of the previous people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One chase and escape a few people have rushed into the center of the elf city in no time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are all high-rise trees with a height of 20 to 30 meters and a pile of thousands of piles that are so large that they are scattered. Although it is more grand and bustling than the whispering elves in the slang. But there is also no fireworks that is artificially carved. The only exception is the huge transfer of the magic array on the stone platform sandwiched by the three central villages, which adds some artificial traces to this natural place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. "You can't escape without having to escape anyway." Asa suddenly stopped in the place where the magical array was not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the people also stopped. Hilton's mouth spit and fell to the ground. In fact, Asa didn't say that he probably couldn't support it for a long time. His degree is the slowest in the use of the strength of the milk to be able to barely follow the other people behind this gallop has long been his limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill old man is all along the way to persuade the werewolf who is holding him to go with Asa. But not in the middle of the running, the wind is too loud to hear Druid still running with a few temporary companions in one place. Now Asa stops and he stops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three shrine knights are already less than 20 meters behind them, and even if they continue to run away, they can’t run far. When they saw the target suddenly stop, they suddenly stopped. The white shape of the original speeding is said to stop and stop. It is only the free transition between the movements that the difference between the levels can be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot is in the middle of the other two Knights of the Knights. One hand is a two-handed sword. Although it is not as exaggerated as the one used by Helica, it is flowing. The silver light wave and the sharp edge indicate that the weapon's lethality is absolutely above the big iron. The other is that the black spears are as transparent as a black diamond. The three men looked at the five targets in front of them without hesitation. The calm and free posture and posture are like three lions looking at the prey under their claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's possible to solve the spells of Adelaide in such a short period of time. It seems that your strength is still my imagination." Lancelot quietly looked at the light in Asa's brown scorpion. It was dazzling, but Asa felt the silent and invisible transparency. It’s just that he has the feeling that the stripped clothes are thrown in front of a wise behemoth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although calm and self-sufficient, although the difference in strength is so obvious, although there is confidence in the belly of the belly. But the three knights, including Lancelot, did not relax. They are still in a state where they can react at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite five people have different shapes. In addition to Asa and Jessica, they are still calmer. Others are all loose and full of flaws. It’s hard to get a Hilton without falling into the ground. And Bill's old man still riding on Druid's back seems to be reluctant to go down, Druid is uneasily swinging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The werewolf’s swinging around for a while actually went to the three knights in a sudden pace. The three Asa people were shocked and stunned and couldn't wait for them to react. The Werewolf Druid had already arrived in front of Lancelot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I surrender." It’s not that Anderson is the old man on his back. The hands of the old man were all blurred and struggling in the eyes of the werewolf on the werewolf's head. Bill's old man was slowly licking his mouse head and a mouse-like face intertwined with a devout image of fawning and pretending. "This werewolf is a Druid is also dizzy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most evil pagan. I have just controlled him with a soul shackle. Now I want to squat in the god of light. In the glory of the glory. I only ask the Lord to forgive me before..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the head became more and more ambiguous, the voice of Bill's old man became more and more strange. Then suddenly his voice was gone because the more and more stunned mouse head smashed out of his neck and fell. And he did not seem to know how to return to his mouth, but his face was still surprised by the sudden change of his sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The pagans are not dirty." Lancelot faintly looked down at the head with his eyes turned. "The only part of the muscles is the selfish soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, Bill’s old man still left on the wolf’s back was squirting a short stature. The blood spring, the mouse's wretched body did not have much power and then fell down and the werewolf Druid suddenly woke up. Looking at the shrine of the shrine, who was close at hand, was shocked and hurriedly escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three Knights of the Temple did not move at least in the eyes of the surrounding elves and the Hilton on the ground. They stopped and stopped. They never seemed to move the orc. The head of Shangdi’s old man fell for himself for no reason. They all exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s eyes jumped and only he saw that Lancelot did not move at all. It was the shrine of the shrine holding the two-handed sword next to him. The body of the knight turned and turned the silver sword. In a flash, a silver light passed through the neck of the old man. Even Bill's old man didn't realize that his head and neck were actually separated. It’s just that the two-handed sword is very thin and the sword is too fast and too clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You... don't accept surrender?" Asa frowned. The expression on Hilton and Druid’s face has also changed with this question. “No knight will never want to kill the weak and unintentionally fighting. Even the pagans may have a chance to redeem. But selfishly betraying the companion is filthy. The performance of the dirty soul is far more problematic than what a magic or belief." Lancelot looked at Asa faintly. "It is very sensible and correct for him to surrender. But he should never be out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selling friends. His friend did not leave him when he fled. Now he has to use his companions as a condition for survival. The selfish soul can not be washed even by the glory of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You just said, 'The pagans are not dirty...' Asa looked at the magical array and turned to look at the three Knights in front. "It seems that this is not the same as the identity of the Knights of the Shrine. At least that woman's shrine knight is not like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord said that tolerance is the greatest light. Anyone who is not sure of evil gives him the opportunity to redeem. Justice is a natural and self-contained force. It is not a dogma that hangs on the top of manipulative behavior. Talis Knight is still too young to understand this. The difference," Lancelot said faintly. His appearance is not very majestic and there is an extraordinary look that can make people feel at a glance. The greatness of ‘justice’ and ‘light’ that he said from his mouth has begun to be vulgar and not the same as in other populations. There is no such tone of sublime worship and no deliberate improvement in tone. Instead, use a plain voice and a state of mind to be as comfortable as an ordinary person talking about his eating habits. But it is this kind of voice that is not deliberately carved. It is far more infecting people than any declaration and preaching because it contains the anger that is swayed from personality and soul. He looked at Asa and continued: "Are you stopping to surrender?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...you can be you..." Asa sorted out the ideas and vocabulary<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question in his head does not allow enough to ask directly. If he directly said that there are actually several Necromancers in the church who are secretly manipulating their own leaks, they are not attracted to the Knights of the Temple. This problem will never be accepted by the Paladin. "How come you have so many people? If you just annihilate a thief group, you don't need to go out with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know that I am just patronizing the priest The order took the person who claimed to be 'Sandru' back. It was not that I would have been your famous wanted criminal, but I saw you at the moment I saw you. I already guessed Talis. The man named Shandru in the mouth of the knight is you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teach...the emperor...the pope of the Pope..."Asa's eyebrows wrinkled deeper and deeper Thinking too much, my eyes are smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only person in the church who is unlikely to be with the Necromancer is the Pope and the Paladin. But the name of 'Sandru', which was originally prepared for the Necromancers, did not attract the Necromancer but brought them. According to his envisaged plan, the Necromancers are determined to be right for him. Then I would never hope that he knows a lot of things.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the church, you will find ways to organize church intervention and come in person. But the result is exactly the opposite. Are the Necromancers absent? Didn't just hear the hint that I only said to them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Pope will never send a close to half of the masters of Celeste for a group of thieves<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp And this is the only explanation that Sandro is not familiar to the Necromancers. At least the pope also knows him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The one you said...Talis Knight...The message she brought back is that only you and the Pope know?" Asa asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot also frowned slightly. He was puzzled by the question he asked and the strange expression. But he hesitated and replied: "There should be a lot of people who don't know. It is said that adults of Ascher have also recommended me to deal with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aescher is him..." Asa frowned. Since the Necromancers know why they are not coming? Not afraid of being killed in the process of being arrested by the church? Then their clues to the leaves of the world village are broken. Not afraid of leaking some secrets about the Necromancers after being arrested? Asa only felt that tens of millions of flies in the head flew with the bees, but they also ran into it, but they did not have a clear path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘啪. ‘Asa suddenly slaps a slap in the face. A palm print immediately appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is a glimpse of a few people who are mad at the face of three invincible shrine knights. "I was wrong." Asa sighed heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot smiled slightly. This is not a ridiculous joke but an understanding of him: "The confusion and confusion in the eyes have disappeared. Do you figure out what you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I didn't figure it out. But I know I was wrong." Asa nodded. "I wasn't a sly person who didn't want to conspire, but he still had to use his own calculations to be smart. The failure was also my own."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Good. Rare." Lancelot nodded again. This joke is a little thumbs up. "Be able to recognize your own mistakes and admit your weaknesses. This is an opportunity to grow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Paladin is not like facing an enemy. Expression Asa feels very strange and asks: "Since you know that I am the infamous all-nighter how it looks... isn’t it so awkward to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The offense is a wanted criminal. But an honest person deserves to be praised, especially to be honest with himself. What's more..." Lancelotton paused in a rather strange tone. "About your crimes... I am not very clear..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
