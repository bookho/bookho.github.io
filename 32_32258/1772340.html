			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter is placed at the entrance to the tunnel, which is a close-up of Lancelot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, your entry into the world is a thousand miles, I really admire. The little girl, Talis, had a hard work on the road, and she was very grateful for her help. However, some of her actions have long been unacceptable for the Cavaliers, so she will bring back to Celeste. The things taken from you are also in Celest, and you can take care of them if you need them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter is not written on the stationery, the Knights of the Temple can not carry these things with you, this is a wrap from the mountain hut The corpse is written with the juice of somehow. But the words are simple, the handwriting is vigorous and the air is extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Awaiting what I mean at all? The boring knighthood. If he knows that I am holding something that Moriel is going to give them, I don’t know if it will So welcome?” Asa smiled and dropped the letter, chanting the mantra against the burning body. The blue sparks flowed in his hands, and the bodies that were originally burning were moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bodies are undoubtedly the ones that Shant stayed here for automatic guards, the bodies of senior soldiers who lost their lives in the battles of Nigan and Celeste all the year round. After the processing of the mountain, the ability is not inferior to that before the birth. It is a pity that the Knights of the Temple, which stood out from the tunnel, were completely devoid of the white magic in the Dragon Cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames on the corpse are automatically extinguished, the burnt parts are automatically detached, and the bodies are fused together. Although the white magical destruction passed. But these corpses are made by Shant after all, and they are still a good carrier of Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the mantra, a huge monster made up of these bodies was formed. It is impossible to create a flying form by using Asa's magical ability. This is a rhinoceros-like horse-shaped corpse monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, a crow is hovering over the sky. Looking at the movement below, I have been watching the huge corpse monster carrying Asa and the two Necromancers with a heavy scent and stinking quickly on the dead ground of Nigan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you write to him?" Naturally, the text on the cloth was not visible from the crystal ball, and the pope looked at Lancelot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just write and ask him to come to the Glorious Castle." Lancelot replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I don’t know if you still have such a literary talent. If he can really come, I really want to meet this person in person. Actually, I was able to save Moriel, and I really became more and more interested in him." The Pope said with a blank expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lancelot had just returned through the transmission of the magic array, His Majesty the Pope and Inham had been viewing the scene in the crystal ball in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are told by your majesty, the purgatory paradise has been successfully used when the ox heads and the black elves are guilty, and the power of Nigan has been hit hard, but The task of killing Moriel failed, and there were some changes in the middle. Someone intervened to rescue Moriel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Someone intervened? Who?" Slot's report made the Pope's face happy first. Then quickly switched to shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The man who told me to bring him here." From the beginning. The most watched by Lancelot's gaze is not the Pope's Majesty, but the Bishop of Hamm. "The man may appear in a cemetery on the surface of Nigan, where it seems to have lived a Necromancer, but not now... Bishops should know where it is, ask the bishop to cast a spell to see, okay?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the appearance of Asa in the crystal ball, the Pope and Inham Bishop were both stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please rest assured that he will definitely come here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Why? "The Pope is awkward." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a reason for nature, but for this reason..." Lancelot looked at Bishop Inham. “It’s good to ask the bishop to avoid it first.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The genus knows." Lancelot features the head. "But before that, I have to report to your Majesty an accident that we have encountered in the battle with Mori, and also ask the bishop to listen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Paladin's replacement is very peaceful, and there is no difference between the voice and the voice, but both the Pope and the Cardinal know that this calm and lurking is not calm. In particular, Lancelot seemed to be very casual, and naturally moved a little closer to the Cardinal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red cardinal brow slightly picks. I saw Lancelot and my face was still a nice smile. The eyes of the Pope also shook a little with amazement between Cardinal and Lancelot, and nodded and said, "Tell, let's talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Lancelot's face is still calm. “It’s true that since Bishop Hamm told us that Moriel was really weak because of the seal’s defect, we did have the upper hand in her battle... but when we were fighting Mori, there was A Tauren priest suddenly attacked us. He used a scroll. A gravity field, a space lock, two fire elements, and a fire bomb and a thunderstorm bomb..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" At the same time, the pope and the bishop of Inham, the two looked at each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The use of these scrolls, the timing, the means are seamless. I have to say that if it is not the sudden spoil of that person, I and a few others are absolutely Can't come back, even so, the Knights of Yuland also died in the gravity field... Your majesty, these reels are not the ones that the Tauren can have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pope nodded slightly: "I know that even there is no space lock and gravity field in Celeste..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the combination of these scrolls is used After a rigorous calculation, I have reason to believe that this is for us..." Lancelot is watching Bishop Inham talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Bishop Hamm is still laughing, but it has become a bitter smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to say anything more." The Pope raised his hand and said faintly. The tone is dull and the expression is very stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Lancelot features a head, shuts up, and retracts his gaze on the Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope raised his head and looked at the ceiling and thought for a while. When he looked down again, he said, "Probably Sedros... He traveled to the mainland in his early years." It’s not surprising that people have friendship with the Tauren. And Oufu now has the largest source of magical gems in the continent, and it has connections with the Tower of Tooth. Two or three reels are just a small meaning. The most important thing is...” The Pope smiled . "I believe in Bishop Hamm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, sir." Inham nodded and bowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing in control," Lanslot turned and bowed to Bishop Inham, and he apologized. "Sorry, Bishop. Please forgive me for rashness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Bishop Hamm still smiles, shakes his head and says, "This is what I originally proposed. The connection with the Tauren is also what I have done first. It is entirely reasonable for you to make such a judgment. Lancelot is an adult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pope said, "Okay, now you talk about why the kid will come here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of a very chance, I am from He grabbed this thing. I think he will definitely come and take it." Lancelot took out the small pocket from Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." The Pope and Inham Bishop are both a glimpse. Lancelot then untied the rope at the mouth of the bag, and a faint breath followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breath is very weak, but the faces of the Pope and Inham Bishop are greatly changed. Both of them were originally heavy in the city, and they have already practiced their anger and anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This breath... Is it... it should be..." The Pope reached out and took the pocket, slowly untied the rope on his pocket, his hand trembled . The bag was untied, and the Pope's hand was held at the bottom of the bag, and a black cylinder flew out of the bag. The faint, but incomprehensible breath suddenly fills every inch of space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
