			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central tree of the whispering forest has begun to wither. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great tree crown has become a yellow, numerous green leaves that have lost vitality and moisture is slowly dying. In the square, the huge yellow leaves are falling. The huge branches have begun to wither. The ancient tree is like a dying giant. It is gradually dying in a way that is commensurate with his volume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunwell that had been shimmering under the ancient tree has dried up. This is why even the whispering roots are beginning to mutate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the water that has been plucked by the war trees has been slowly recovered, the well water that has been slowly recovering has not been left with the bluestone that was originally covered with moss. It becomes as weird as cinder. The sky is still cloudless, but the sun that shines doesn't know why it doesn't shine brightly. There is a kind of cold gloom in the light that shines down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient tree of war depends not on ordinary water and nutrients but on the energy of the earth and the sun. Although the Dark Star has not yet fully opened, the breath of death has begun to spread along the veins. Not only the ancient trees of war, but the entire whisper of the whispers have begun to show signs of dying death. All the old trees began to wither and the unicorns and the winged Pegasus were all irritated. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the world tree leaves still have the last piece of the boundless vitality to complement the Sunwell to resist the erosion of this breath. The leaves of the three world trees could not be razed as long as they could be connected to the last trial of tens of thousands of years ago. But now everything is gone. The elves will also face this catastrophe with other races. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the tree stands on the altar where the world tree leaves. It is the skin of Gruta that has now become black without life. He stood there and looked at it without any difference from a black rock statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few elves next to him took huge leaves of water and poured them down from the leaves. They fell very slowly. I was also very careful that my face was as heavy as if it was not water but their life. Every drop of fine water drops is under their control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the altar is Luya's sitting and closing his eyes, slowly moving the spell, the green magical fluctuations, like a piece of fog, swirling around these currents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is already the last well of the Sunwell, so you are used by it... used in a humble half-elf..." Karin’s eyes are sluggish Look at the leaves of the central elves in the altar. "If it wasn't for Elder Lloyd who told us to help you, I don't know why Elder Lucy is listening to you, I must call all the elves to stop you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Humble half Elf... Did you describe this ally who saved your elves?” Asa sneered aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I admit that General Gru has helped us. But after all, he is a half-elf, the unique atmosphere and appearance can not cover up, even if we agree with him In this case, the status of identity will never agree with his lineage. From ancient times, the noble elves and the children of the low-lying human beings are the most despicable, and only the elves with the noble bloodlines of the royal family are qualified to touch. The more you touch the sun well and the leaves of the world tree, the more you can be accepted by this life and the power of light..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up, I am not in the mood to teach you again. Stinky and long cultural traditions." Asa waved his face and interrupted the words of the Elf Patrol. He is in a bad mood now. Originally, I was hoping to find a way to deal with the current situation in the whispering forest but I found nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he brought Gru to here, the elves had already known the appearance of the Dark Star from the changes in the Sunwell and the leaves of the world tree. More surprisingly, Elder Lloyd did not seem to show much shock and panic. It was only a little unexpected that Asa appeared directly here. After he turned around and cleaned up, he said that he had something to leave. For Asa’s request, he generously left a sentence: "Mr. Asa has helped us in the elves, and he has any need to help. Give help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is truly incomparably great. But Asa did not find any useful help. In the books of the elves, some of the records about the Dark Star were suddenly ‘disappeared’. Any questions about how to deal with the Dark Stars were related to the other elves, including Lucia. The elves didn’t pretend to pretend that Asa could see that the generous elder elder must have said the generous words in public and then said something privately. The elves’ dead brains are what they have said they will not say. Nothing will be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, Asa’s other requests did indeed help the elves. All elf elders who can use natural magic have used the restoration magic of the natural system on Gru, but the traces of blackness remaining on his body have not been reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is not a complete body, the king of the dead has merged with the Dark Star. There is no difference between Gruner's punch and the Dark Star, and even the ancient dragon and Titan's body can't afford the boundless darkness. It was only the black on the fist that had completely spread to the whole body of Gru. Asa can feel that only the deepest part of his body has a breath of green and white. The power of the leaves of the world tree is the same as the body that once filled with incomparable strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural magic of the elves is not completely useless. Asa can feel that as long as the elves use the power of the leaves of the world tree in the magical Gru, they are slowly instigating. It’s just that the power of the Dark Star is too strong and too dark to break through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try with the sun well water." Asa thought about it and said finally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is in peacetime, this requirement is naturally no problem. But now the source of the sun well is already depleted. If the residual well water in the well is used again, the entire whispering enchantment war tree and the power source of the dead wood guards will disappear immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elder Lloyd is not saying that I have any help in the place where you will help me? The roots of Sunwell’s power have lost these waters but they can only be short-lived. Maintaining the enchantment of the whispering sensation, this enchantment is now impossible to withstand the end of the trial water can no longer walk from the well for a long time. Since this is not as good as it is now used. At least I know General Gru is The only person who can threaten that monster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." After considering the good Luya nodded and agreed. This elf girl's face has always been covered with a thick haze. Before she was different, she did not take the initiative to talk to Asa. Sometimes she stared at Asa with a strange look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elder Luya. If we do this, we will whisper..." The other elders all opposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have to say that Elder Lloyd has already said that we want to help him as much as possible. And he also makes sense.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Lloyd, she is already the most decisive person in this whispered singer. As long as she agrees with other elves, she will only do it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With Lucia's spell, the tiny drops of water drip on the body of Gru, the water did not slide down his body, nor did it splash, but was completely integrated into his body with the green magical fluctuations around the water. The black that seems to solidify into his body's true color has finally begun to change.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is slow, the black at the drop is indeed dissipating. The key is that Asa feels The vitality of the body of Gru and the power of the leaves of the world tree began to grow slowly and slowly to the outreach.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fortunately, it seems true Effective. "Asa finally breathed a sigh of relief. This is the only good news he has had these days and the best news that can be achieved at the moment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision is Looking at the black of Gru's body slowly dissipating Asa's thoughts but it has already fallen elsewhere. He is thinking. Under the current situation, he seems to be an inexplicable situation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Suddenly the elves began to make trouble, and Asa also looked up at the sky with a slight glimpse. A huge shadow has already flown over the top of the war tree, which is hovering over the top of the war tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding elves all took out the bows and arrows they carried, and others began to sing the spells. It’s not that they are allergic to any uninvited guests but are accompanied by This huge figure came from a wave of magical fluctuations that made the elves instinctively feel the horror and hostility. Even Luya and the elves who were casting spells stood up in panic.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone This is not to panic the enemy will not be a threat to everyone. Asa shouted and made a peace of mind gesture to Luya.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This breath is familiar to him. This time it appears here and let him Feel kind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
