			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new cardinal is naturally reasonable to meet with the Emperor, but Geffenhardt XVII has gone out to the South. Therefore, this time the bishop is naturally unable to see the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the beloved queen was sick, the emperor went on a parade. This is obviously not his own will, but the great priest and the prime minister and Roland. The head of the German team agrees. If the young emperor wants to face the complicated political problems brought by the cardinal in person, it is undoubtedly incapable of grasping the inextricable relationship between those problems, not to mention mishandling, even if it is a certain state of stagnation or ignorance. The possibilities may be troublesome. A cardinal sent by His Majesty the Pope will not be easy to fool. So instead of staying here, it's better to go out and leave the prime minister and Rod Hart so that they have more space to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s not just the two of them. On the contrary, after meeting the cardinal, the two men have very few words and some strange looks. Ryan’s great priest first opened the door: “Javier is so young that he can get the appreciation and trust of His Majesty the Pope. At this time, the position of the Cardinal is granted, even in the history of the church. It’s really a genius. From the perspective of the old man, whether you are martial arts or magical cultivation is indeed extraordinary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where, you have won the prize." Cardinal faint A smile. He naturally heard that this is a foundation, and what is to be said below is the topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan Great God Officer sighed. Said: "Speaking recently, we have a real problem. Her Majesty the Queen has recently had a small body, but unfortunately I have been waiting for the white magic to be really shallow, and I can't do anything about my condition. So we have been waiting for the bishop. Your visit, with your deep and broad magic spells, must be able to let the Queen's Majesty relieve the pain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although both of them are not swearing, but they hear Ryan’s great priest In the words, the prime minister and Rod Hart's look can not help but be unnatural. But the two did not speak. It’s a bit uncomfortable to use them as a means to use them, but the most important thing is that they themselves have to admit that this is really a good idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen’s disease is now a big heart disease that plagues the entire upper level of Wang Du. Although it has been treated by two white magic priests who are proficient in medical treatment, in addition to discovering some strange fluctuations in the Queen's body, there are no other obvious lesions, but it is definitely white magic that is absolutely beneficial to the human body. It also caused her to have an uncomfortable reaction. There was no definitive conclusion on the discussion of the research by the therapists of the Royal College of Medicine and the School of Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as the cardinal rejects the resignation, it is naturally a kind of weakness, which is considered to be a sequel, and everything will be easier in the future. But if the young cardinal is indiscriminately shot. Let the Queen's illness worsen, it has an excellent handle and excuse. It’s just that the prime minister and Rod Hart prefer this kind of thing not to happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new cardinal frowned and asked: "I don't know what is the illness of the Queen's Majesty? Even the priest of the School of Magic has no way? According to what I know, the School of Magic The accomplishments in physical magic are already the leaders of the mainland..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan’s great sergeant reveals a strange expression that he does not know whether he is happy or sad, saying: Even we don't know what kind of disease it is. It is obvious that there is no disease in the body of the Queen. There is no disease in the body, but the Queen has no spirit and appetite, and the diet does not enter. And the body of the armpit seems to be right. Our white magic is somewhat repulsive, and we check the information to conclude that this is probably a rare tumor. But these should not be a problem for the bishop. Cereste is in the eyes of all bright magicians. Holy Land, the bishop is a genius among them, white magic must be pure and profound, and should not let us down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Jia Wei frowned slightly Thinking A moment, then revealing a happy smile, nodded and replied: "Okay, let me do a little bit of effort to solve the problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half day Later, Bishop Jia Wei immediately accompanied the big priest and the prime minister and Rod Hart to the palace, and several pastors and priests followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the emperor was absent, the queen who was sick was still in the hall to meet the cardinal. Her face was paler and paler. Although it did not appear to be obviously thin, but the powerless eyes looked even more bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first saw that the new cardinal was so young, Her Majesty also showed amazed look, and immediately heard that The red-collar church diagnosed and treated him, and said with a slightly flustered look: "There is no need to work as a bishop. I really only need to be rehabilitated..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;The Queen looked at the prime minister and Rod Hart. Both of them had some embarrassing and somewhat sorrowful faces, but they all nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be afraid, the glory of the Lord can sweep away all the pain." The Cardinal showed a sunny smile and reached out to the Queen's forehead. The Queen flinched a little, or sat quietly and closed her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord pity the world, shines in the world with incomparable brilliance, and removes everything..." Bishop Jia Wei gently recited the prayer, with a slight white between the palms. The light of magic shines through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen suddenly snorted and shook. Under the white magic light, her face was white like a white paper that had been bleached repeatedly. Not only was it white, but it was bloody, and even the most subtle life seemed to disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咦?" Bishop Jia Wei also withdrew his hand and his face was suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mulak and Rodhart both came forward in a panic, and if they were not the Queen’s Majesty, they sat there, the discomfort on their faces. Not too heavy, they will think that she is dead only by that face. Only Ryan’s big priest’s face had some undetectable smiles: “The bishop’s adult. I’m afraid...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Bishop Javi suddenly raised Hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gaze is still on the Queen's body, just a smile on his face, instead he is dignified and thinking. This expression was revealed on his face, which was always smiling. The suddenness and momentum of the expression made everyone feel clear. Everyone unconsciously stopped his own under his own hands. action. Ryan’s great priest’s words did not continue to look down. Mullak Prime Minister and Rod Hart did not come forward any more, and all eyes were on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Jia Wei took a deep breath and closed his eyes, and his hand was placed on the head of the Queen. This time it is no longer the hand that shines white magic, but his entire body. With this movement, the three people in the room all gave birth to an illusion, as if it was no longer an individual, but a statue of God with a divine power, a kind of calm and raging momentum from his expression. His body, his standing posture swept out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mulak Prime Minister and Rod Hart originally wanted to open up and stop, but in the majestic momentum of the Cardinal, they did not move unconsciously. . It’s not fear or other emotions. It’s just that the self-confidence and self-confidence of the previous hand made others completely believe in him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord said that pain is there, darkness is the place of existence, but faith can make you feel the light..." With the prayer from the mouth It was said that the white magic light of Bishop Jia Wei was getting brighter and brighter, and even drowned his figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light is getting brighter and brighter. More and more strong, the hall is completely submerged by this holy light, and at the same time there is a surging magical power. Anyone standing in this hall can use the skin to feel this wave of magical waves like a wave of dyeing, and the vitality and holy light are filled in this hall. Even every breath of air seems to make the body feel business and vitality, purifying all the discomfort in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great color of the three priests’ faces is getting heavier and heavier, but what they are surprised is not the strong magical power of the cardinal. Sheng Sheng. Surprisingly, this way of using magic, this is not the righteousness of white magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A snorting sounds from the dazzling white light, and at the same time the light shines to a climax. In the strong light and magical fluctuations, everyone can feel that the hall seems to shake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just the people in the hall. It is the pastor and the priest standing outside the temple that can feel this strange vibration. However, the hall itself did not move, and even the teacups on the table did not shake. This is not the actual strength, but an imposing force that can involve the soul and soul of the human being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Library of the School of Magic. An old pastor who was reading a book suddenly looked up and snorted in surprise, looking at the direction of the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, Bishop Javi still stood there, but he had already retracted his hand, and the sweat that had covered him had soaked his clothes. Although the tiredness on his face was heavy, the sun-like smile came to his face, and he smiled and looked at the Queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone gave a low-pitched exclamation, and the great gods were amazed. Mullak Prime Minister and Rod Hart were pleasant surprises, and the maids next to them cheered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong? Tom's old singer?" In the library, several other young purchasers and magic apprentices looked back at the old man who made the sound. They have been talking about the new cardinal. The ages that are similar to them, but they are completely incomparable. The status, demeanor, manners, etc. can all evolve into countless topics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old pastor still frowns with a look of horror on his face, and gently wrinkles his nose and sucks in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" asked a few young people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old pastor looked at them and squinted and said: "It seems like someone has put a fart."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few young people suddenly snorted, and one almost didn’t stand up and fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, hell, I know that this old man is nervous again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord Forgive the old guy's mouth in this sacred hall. I can testify that he is not intentional, but his mind is a little bit problematic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" God is on, are you really a clergyman? I can guarantee that if you are in Celeste, you must have been a prisoner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Are you a dog's nose? We didn't smell each other so close to each other, how did you smell it? It's not what you put."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Think we are like you, fart is not an occasion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man spit in the direction of these young people. Said: "I did not say that you put it, with a few of you, smell this fart is not qualified." He immediately frowned and looked around, thoughtfully muttered: "Who is it... seems It’s new...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Who is new? You can’t always say the new bishop.” A magic apprentice smiled. Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, Lord. You have been mad by the old man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go and ask the bishop to treat him for him..." "But before that I thought it would be time to treat our stomach. The Lord said that this time I should have lunch." Several young people sneered and left, huge. In the library, there is only the old pastor who sits behind the administrator's counter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old pastor closed the book and glanced in the direction of the palace. Lying in the chair slowly closed his eyes, and in the empty library there was his indescribable self-talking voice: "Maybe this kid..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In the palace, I saw the apparently ruddy face of the Queen, and everyone was excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "K... Your Majesty, are you okay?" The face of Mulak’s prime minister also had a flush, but it was because of excitement. He first stepped forward to grab the Queen's hand, but he stumbled again. "But how is your hand still so cold?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen, nodded and said with a smile: "Sister, I am fine. The spirit is very good. Thank you, Bishop. "Although her spirit is indeed a lot better, but this smile seems to be reluctant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Mulak please rest assured." Bishop Jia Wei also smiled at the prime minister. His smile was like a spring breeze. "There is a big illness and the suffocation is still very weak. As long as you eat something and cultivate it, you will be able to recover completely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is really good. Your Majesty. You can have something to eat.” The joy of Rod Hart’s face is not pretending, and he cares more about the Queen’s body than anyone else. But the Queen just looked at him, and the sorrow in his eyes mixed with something else to let him know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The white magic of the bishop's adults is extraordinary, which makes the illnesses of countless physicians and pastors scattered in the hands of adults, it is really admirable. The healing of the Queen’s sorrow is also a happy event.” Ryan’s great priest screamed, though the words were praised. But there is no such thing as joy. He did not think that this strange disease that made everyone feel helpless actually let the young man heal. This time, not only did he not give him a horse, but he seemed to have a lot of capital for his success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
