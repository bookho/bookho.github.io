			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are still the same as before..." Because Hamm shook his head slightly and turned away, and turned and walked away to the place where the gargoyle was placed. This is his last glance at the gentleness of the past to all the gentle and farewell of twenty years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how beautiful it is, it has passed away. The same no matter how cruel the future is coming. The same two can not be changed, how to face it still has to face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stand up." Vidnina's voice suddenly topped. "Where are you going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry. I have a very important thing to have a chance to be your audience again. If there is still a chance... Goodbye... ..." Because Ham's head is not getting back faster and faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said to stand." Ved Nina waved a green flame and the wall was almost rubbed as Hamm's toes suddenly rose from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Hamm frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru did not speak or move. Because Hamm wanted to leave him, he didn’t seem to want to stop. His face was still gloomy but the violent There is no more murderousness, just watching the two men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can I make you feel bad if you don't want to hear it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s not just to escape, I just have something to do.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What else can you do? Don’t you know that all this is fate, what you did. Are you in vain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you know that I am in vain, what are you doing to stop me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Do you feel hopeful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe one in ten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This small possibility does not let you remind me of crazy gamblers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know I never gamble, I only do I think that the opportunity to do this is a small opportunity. If you don't do it, even one in ten thousand chances will be lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence a moment Nina said slowly: "Just a few words, I must tell you now. Because there may be no more in the future." . I will be the "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" Oh, "Yin Hamu a little bit surprised?. "You said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know? You are weak. You have been like this from now until now. You are not under anyone but you are Now you are still a loser because you are weak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inham sighed softly. Shake his head slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't admit it. Think about what you have done with your heart for the past 20 years? Go around the mountains and play with you? And your countless lovers with lots of 6 Ghostly? If you can concentrate all your energy in one place, you will never be like this. Whether you concentrate on the magic or fight for a bigger power, you can have more power to deal with this later life. There are even a few hopes that can delay the gear of fate. But you don't. From the moment you refused to face the fate, you are destined to live in a weak escape waiting for the fate to be crushed by the gear of the times. The determination to persevere in destiny but to resist destiny has not been doomed to you from the moment you choose to escape from destiny."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a lesson Me? Thank you. "Because Hamm smiled and reached out and faced the green flame high wall. A road was scattered in the middle of the flame. But just as he was about to continue to move forward, the more violent flames once again rose to the sky and filled the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven't finished talking about it. Don't you know how to respect people?" The flames in the Lich's eyes are a lot stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know you don't have to say anything," said Hamm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The most unbearable thing is that you are so obsessed with your own attitude, but you don't want to admit that you pretend that everything is in your heart." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm weak?" The voice between the lich's throat suddenly changed like the sound of a thousand faces that had been slamming and suddenly cracked together. The flame in her eyes was so strong that it was almost out of her face. It was only the face that was still so embarrassing. She could only see that her emotions were so excited that she couldn’t tell if she was funny or something else. "I have abandoned such a beautiful body, so many people have dreamed of what they have done, and even the magical feats that Akibad did not complete have turned into lichs. Do you actually say that I am weak? I stand on the wheel of destiny. The advancement of the wheel, even the power of the whole big 6 can not stop me from being weak?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Weakness is the power of a woman... Of course, it is also stubborn." Hamm smiled lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it." Ved Nina should be sneer. "You are just a loser. Where can you beat me from the Magic Academy? Until now, where did you compare with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I admit to the understanding of magic, the magic of the debate, the magic of the actual combat, I have no one to catch up with you now, it is indeed your victory, but the strength of the winner and the weakness is not the opposite. The strength is not equal to the inner strength. The weaker the talent The more eager to prove yourself with victory.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Victory is the victory failure is where the failure is still used to prove? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't prove that you need me to stay and listen carefully to your victory statement?" Don't you want to see my annoyed remorse to verify your own success? At least I am sure that Akibad never hoped that he was great and never felt so. He did not convert to a lich. It is not impossible or unwilling because he has faced his life with frankness. He is a great man because he accepts everything that belongs to him, including death and failure. "Inham paused and watched Vad Nina's eyes sigh with an unusual flame. He continued to sigh." The so-called fate is that we can’t grasp what we can do. . The formation of the Dark Star is just a cycle of the world itself. After the Dark Star releases the final judgment, perhaps even the king of the dead will disappear. What can you get? But it is the illusion of all the more. In fact, no matter what you do, where are you standing, you are still a dust under the wheel of destiny. What you are pursuing is not the pursuit of destiny. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you feel that everything you do is forced by yourself?" It’s forced by your obsession with everything. Why can't you be stronger? Going to face it and accept it in this way to escape? I know that we all have a place that you are sorry for, but you also have to understand that we all have their own positions. Their respective reasons... In fact, no matter what time you choose to wait for me to come back or choose someone else, you will be better than now..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop--" The voice of the lich’s body burst out loud enough to make people wonder if she would shatter her broken and dry body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My words are finished." Goodbye. "The wall of the wall after the expression on Ham's face has not changed. He turned and went to the original direction.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are going to die." "The flame in the eyes of Ved Nina has been poured into a hundred pounds of fire. It is so strong that everything except anger is burned to ashes. Her dry hands are lifted. The black magic is fluctuating. A giant green flamingo rushed in her arms and instantly appeared in front of her.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no hot air in the air and any abnormalities. All the temperatures and necrotic magic that have reached the entity are all hidden in it. The firebird spreads its wings and makes a green afterimage to fly back to her inham.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Hamm is still walking. Although the flamingo is silent, the violent magical fluctuations can be felt as a eternal life and a magical big ear monster can feel it. I didn’t even return.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The firebird turned into a rich green flame. The ocean swallowed the shadow of Hamm and even the surrounding obsidian ground. They are melting at the high temperature of this mixed magical magic. This is the dragon of darkness. *The flames of the same kind have no objects to survive under this flame.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame in the eyes of Vid Nina has reduced a lot of the spells released by this spell. It’s not just magic, she’s drowning in sensible anger. She seems to be just watching the murderous hand that swallowed the fire of Hamm’s figure. The dry hand has remained in the air and has not been put down. Once she is so immobile, it’s true. There is no difference between a statue and a statue.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
