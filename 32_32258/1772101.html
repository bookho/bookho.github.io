			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The post-mortem search force almost turned over the entire land of a hundred miles around the king. However, they did not have much effort to have a few magical arrays in the woods. The pastors of the church examined it. This is indeed what the Necromancers used to summon evil creatures. Fortunately, a large part of them had a small problem, so only a small number of monsters were summoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even the ‘not many’ monsters are enough to make the empire and even the entire Dongda 6 fall out of the sky. The sinister heart of the Necromancer Association has become clear that it is a sinister monster who wants to turn all of them into vampires when they are gathered together. This evil wizard organization has finally revealed its true colors and has received the attention of all countries. The frightened Geffenhardt XVII was negotiating with the bishop to directly send the Paladin to the Deva Valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Bishop Ronis fully expressed his vision. Although he has been working hard to call on the countries to jointly fight against the Necromancer, but now there is no impulse to rash. He patiently explained the current situation with His Majesty the Emperor. It is recommended that the Emperor first join forces with the surrounding countries to write to the Pope to obtain the support of the Holy See before they can gradually implement the plan to crusade the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Roones announced that the priest and the lady were able to destroy the vampire because both of them went to the cathedral that morning and prayed heartily The holy water also accepted the blessing of the bishops, so they only had the power of holiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the entire Dongda 6 has begun to have an atmosphere of uniting to deal with the Necromancer. Although the plan for the future is still huge, the first step of the bishop of Ronis is really good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small study in the Cathedral of the School of Magic stands in front of the Bishop of Ronis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His injuries were all well with the help of the priests and they were awake for a whole day because of the extreme overdraft of physical strength and magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop’s skinny hand holds a paper report that lists the name of the person who died in the hands of the vampire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After carefully watching those names, Bishop Ronis showed a very satisfied smile and nodded, "Death is good."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Asa standing next to him wondered if he had got it wrong. He was uneasy that the adult master would surely reprimand him because this little performance became a killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The people of the Elni family of the dead have a majority. Actually, my original intention was to take advantage of this opportunity to get rid of some. It’s also a good lesson. He finally knows that it’s not really useful to be able to play with him. This time it’s also a promotion of his pro-industry and his temptations. It will also be helpful for us to fight against the Necromancer in the future." Bishop Ronis smiled and fully affirmed. "So it's good to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah. Oh." Asa idiot nodded as no. After thinking about it, he said, "But those guards are a little bit dying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Rooney waved his hand and made an indifferent gesture. Said faintly: "There is no way that these people must die anyway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh," Asa nodded and felt a little uncomfortable. It would seem more appropriate to say such words from the Duke’s mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let's talk about what the vampire is going to do this time." Bishop Rhone's face and voice sank. "This extremely dangerous undead monster has not appeared on the Big 6 for a long time. According to some people, the vampire himself said that it was awakened. This time is just the gathering of people from all over the world and the head of Roland. Because our arrangement is not the most relaxed time under the guardian's majesty. I believe that this can never be just a coincidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa frowned and said: "You Is it that someone deliberately took the opportunity to release the vampire to make trouble? Who is it? Is it true that the dead guild people? But how do they know our plans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are very few things they don't know." The voice of Bishop Ronis is getting colder and colder, and the light in his eyes is getting more and more fierce. "I used to suspect that there are members of the DPRK or the church in the upper class. They may be members of a guild. But now it is a sure thing. It should be a well-hidden well-hidden. People. Maybe a person who is completely integrated with the surrounding environment will never attract attention. A plain official. A devout pastor is more likely to have a prominent position to cover. I think this person may be away from us. Maybe If you are very close, you may not be able to grasp the timing so well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like? What kind of talent do you think?" Bishop Ronis looked at Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the lich is like a zombie face wearing a mask and wearing a robes to cover up the whereabouts. It’s a secret. Or the old man of Sandro Then I turned around around the body all day. Isn’t that the Necromancer like that?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Rooney said with a smile: “A decade ago, Luo The court magician Ramado of the Principality of Enders not only refined the magic of the various departments, but also the accomplishments of the white magic. The generosity and generosity of the people are more generous and generous. Every year, half of their annual offerings are used to relieve the poor and the orphans. The reputation of the public is unparalleled even in the entire Dongda 6. But I tell you that he is a necromancer. The entire war of the Principality and the surrounding countries in the past ten years is all he is behind and manipulated. I asked the Holy See to move five holy knights to plan and then add me to spend a lot of energy to get rid of this guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Nopolino is the most famous 6 The magician is also the richest and most powerful businessman himself. He is also a very good magician. He has a lot of relationships with all the magician organizations or many of the most respected and respected friends of the royal family. Although there is no real evidence. I infer that he must also be a member of the Necromancer Association, at least mixed with a nominal member position. It is said that every year he has two months to rest on an isolated island overseas, but I think it is actually in the Deya Valley." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The former president of the Empire Adventurers Guild, Ai Grenair. Magic and martial arts are pushed into the top 60 of the Big Six. The 6th and 5th strongest masters are said to be the secrets of the last descendants of the Killer Guild and the rich treasures of the treasures. He is also a member of the Necromancer Association and has also been a guild with Sandru. Acting collar.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss of Asa’s mouth, he knows that few people have actually heard of them. For the young people who are pursuing wealth and glory and martial arts magic, these people are idols who are aiming to practice and fight and have the motivation to take risks. But such three radiant names would be associated with such sinister and evil organizations as the 'Neon Society', which is as ridiculous as the Holy See's pope has three wives and four wives. If this is not the Bishop of Ronis, Asa is only a neurotic saying crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I spent 20 years of effort but only found out these three people and also because they are particularly afraid to speak out even if they get rid of that Rama. After that, he only said that he was dying of illness. There are absolutely other famous figures who are also members of the guild. However, there should be many people like Sandru who are not interested in fame and fortune. They seem to be just a little weird ordinary person. Bishop Ronis looked at Asa slowly. "Now you know what kind of people are the Necromancers. So don't relax your vigilance. Regardless of your identity, the people around you may be the ear of the Necromancer. Maybe it's a Necromancer."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa took a long time to slow down. It seems that this organization will never be just as simple as a group of perverted dark magicians who like to play with corpses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right." Asa seemed to suddenly think of a good way to call it up. "We can ask the old man of Sandrunna. You ordered him to tell him that the other members of the guild would not do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I command him?" The Bishop of Nice smiled a rare smile. "Probably no one in this world can order him to move him. I am just an ordinary friend with him. He is only here he is willing. I naturally asked him about these problems and he refused because of the regulations of the guild." It’s natural to say that I can’t do anything.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Rooney paused and said: “Fortunately, the Necromancer is not organized because of the lack of a collar. It can even be said that a group of scattered sand members are all doing what they do, and most of them are doing what they are doing. But the danger is absolutely inevitable. These necromancers are absolutely difficult to do if they do not act. Coping with it. You see this action, although it is a great success, but it is actually very thrilling. You think if you let the vampire really turn the emperor and some ministers into his men. What would it be? The situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa swallowed. The emperors and ministers of the empire were all under the hands of a vampire. What is the situation with your toes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, in the future, our actions must be very careful and step by step. You must also be vigilant to everyone around you, even if you know that you can’t report it. A 'just in case' mentality to see if you know it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it true that no one except Ms. Mulak is sure that no one is alive after being bitten by a vampire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa shook his head and said, "It seems not" He suddenly remembered that he had hesitated the scar on his neck that Klee had shown off his merits. He didn't know if he should say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop’s face is as heavy as a pig iron sound: “I can’t seem to remember if you have a good time. Miss Mullah has eaten the world. The leaves of the tree, her blood, like yours, will repel the dark monsters like vampires, so don't worry. But if other people are bitten by vampires, even if the vampire has been killed, the magic and toxins left by him will also work. Turn that person into a vampire. We have no way to eliminate the magical influence, so we must make sure that there are no such people who must clear if they have it. Think about it."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really not." Asa answered with a positive answer. Crisna should only be considered a stab wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing." Bishop Ronis nodded. "Actually, I did not anticipate that the blood of the leaf power of the world tree would have such a great effect on the vampire. It seems that your physique may be more effective in practicing bright white magic." Bishop Ronis I looked at Asa with a deep look. "I am going to find a way for Miss Mulke to come to the School of Magic to study. What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't care." Asa deliberately made a very indifferent Expressions and poses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is your current magic practice?" Bishop Rooney frowned and looked at Asa. "It is reasonable to say that your magic is at least not lower than the vampire, how can he be hurt by such a heavy injury."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Because the state is not good, right, the Marquis is waiting for me, I am leaving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa almost ran away from Bishop Ronis of. He is afraid that the bishop will continue to ask his magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the influence of the dual forces of the world tree leaf and the sun well, if you can fully use the magic skills of the resonance chanting and so on, his current level of magic is absolutely It is comparable to a senior magician who has been practicing for many years. But he just can't control his own magical power. Even if it's a little bit of control, the tricky wave is only using the most basic fireball and treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About this question, he has already asked Sandru to listen to his question. Sandru thought and didn’t want to say it: "You haven’t practiced yet. Good other magic goes directly to practice meditation. I don't know why the most difficult meditation you actually practice is faster than the most basic magic. It was just a meditation on other magical meditation. Now your magic is over. Control power in turn suppresses the use of other magic. Well, now you can't use other system magic except for the Necromancer. Do you want to learn Necromancer? I can teach you but if you are Ronnis, you may not have any good results with these things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa only listened to the cold sweat. Bishop Ronis once said to him very seriously that he must never practice the dangerous dark meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s not that he is willing to practice, but that he is at a critical juncture. He can use this skill to survive. Especially from the night when Oufu faced General Gru, the feeling of meditation leaps forward to the time when he was assassinated by the Duke some time ago, even relying on meditation to force out the vindictiveness he never deliberately cultivated. The use of that kind of meditation between life and death seems to be able to achieve breakthrough progress. He has used it more than once and once more skillfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I don’t know why the sun wells and the leaves of the world tree do not exclude this kind of darkness that is reasonable and complements it. . He even started to like the kind of clarity that clearly controls his body's feeling of power running wildly in the vascular limbs. But the cold violent impulse and extravagant bloody nature that appears in this mind at the time makes him a little bit better. I am afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t dare to practice the Necromancer magic and even dared to say to the bishop that his dark meditation is now more and more sophisticated. When I didn't think of a good solution for a while, it was only a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he came to the Marquis to see the Marquis, Asa felt a little easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s really a dramatic exhibition and an end.” The director and screenwriter sighed after listening to Asa’s story. "I can't think of the power of the leaves of the world tree to kill the vampires. Even the director and the actors are feeling the touch of the unknown variables. This is a good show." He looked at Asa. "How about stimulating?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really irritating to death." Asa hesitated and asked. "It’s okay for her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can rest assured that she is very good. The emperor who was greatly moved by her brave wit and loyalty at the time. Her Majesty wants to give her a generous reward, but she doesn't have to ask her to give her an official position. Although my family's old-fashioned family rules can never be allowed, but now those idiots are dead. Less and the emperor’s willingness to deny it? So she is now a financial official of the empire.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why should she do that?” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She said to her Majesty that she hopes to do something for the national community. But who will know the real reason?" Marquis looked at Asa to reveal Very attractive smile. "Maybe she is because of you. Is it not good for a pair of lovers who are temporarily separated to become a priest who is fighting for a bright career? Is it a bridge for the country?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa quickly waved his head and said: "You don't open my jokes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Marquis is deeper One step at a glance, said: "Why do people who love each other want to suppress their feelings? I told you to ask for your time, even if you come to find her, I have very few people in this family."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s dusk when leaving the Marquis. Even if he came to the street, I don’t know why the Marquis’s proposal has been turned around in his mind and made him feel annoyed. In order to rule out this feeling of boredom, he quickly returned to the big house and put on a common dress and walked toward the busy streets.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa woke up and suddenly asked the lady who was lying next to her: "In fact, I always like a woman"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who do you like?" Miss niece is lazy and seems to be a little spirited. "Speak to me what to do? Don't you be afraid of jealous?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You eat it. You have to be jealous for others and die early and die. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to your mother and tell the truth, you don't believe it. I have been jealous for two people in my life. It is natural to push that handsome and handsome. The Rod Hart knight of the model of the young hero, but he did not come to me." Speaking of her idol, the lady, came to the spirit. "Of course, he is a noble person. The other thing is to deal with it for you. Unfortunately, now you don't believe it will not be eaten for you. Take back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled and said: "When will I introduce you to your idol to know you? Then you have the food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wow, is it true? How can someone who is so famous and so noble in fart people know you like this bastard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa touched her head and said "You listen to me. Actually, I always like a woman. She probably likes me too, but I am not so sure, but she is married, but her husband is a fool who never goes home. The nasty bastard never ignores her. You said that I should go to her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa now has a lot of love with this woman, although this The identity of a woman seems to be completely inappropriate for herself but he does not care about it. The key is that he likes to be with such people. They don't have any culture, they don't have to be smart, but at least they are pure. It’s much easier and more fun than the priests and aristocrats who are pretending to be with them. No wonder the noble people like the Marquis used to like to be in these places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to his confession, Miss 璇 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却 却Going? You want to go, as long as you are not afraid of being caught. I have heard that there is a kind of criminal law called dip pig cage is to deal with guys like you. Oh, I will come to see your mischief." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
