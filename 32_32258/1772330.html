			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mollier smiled as if her face was too sharp, and the smile was not amiable, but it looked aggressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, I saved me twice, I will thank you." Moriel's smile is even bigger, but still still not the slightest Goodwill, only aggressive and majestic. "Let's say, what is your last wish to stay in this world? As a thank you, I will try my best to fulfill your last wish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remaining? You What do you mean by this?" Asa stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean? Of course I want to kill you." Moriel looked at him, and there was no murder in her eyes, but Sa feels that she will never be joking. After so many ups and downs, from the tenacity and heart of the nerves, he is definitely not a fuss, and it is even hard to see anything else to surprise him. But his current head is completely empty and chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, no matter who is in such a situation, it is impossible to be surprised. Oneself not only saved, but also helped a very busy dragon. The first thing after recovery seems to be to kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mollier, please be clear, what you are dealing with is just a few Knights of the Temple, that is the person of Celeste, and has nothing to do with me..." Asa retired, he only said this, I hope this is just an inexplicable misunderstanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this seems to be just a woman, Asa can be sure that she is not much stronger than a chicken in front of her. Lancelot can lead the Knights of the Temple to kill him, Asa can be sure that it is because of her weakness. The seal has now been fully supplemented, although it cannot be said that she has fully recovered. But even if Lancelot can lead the Knights of the Temple back and stand on the same line with Asa, the result is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course I am very clear, I don't need your reminder, rest assured, I will not forget the accounts of several guys. After killing you, I can build up my strength." Going out for a while. I heard that Guanghui Castle is the most magnificent building in mainland China. I have always been very curious. I wonder if I can use it for a long time to flatten it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Although when talking about the Knights of the Shrine, Moriel looked condensed, and anger and murder leaked out, but their eyes and words were still clear, indicating that she was sober. She is very clear about what she has to do. Asa is back. She is heading towards Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two voices of the call, Hiprik and Rhodeshard, who were eating the body, slammed off the ground and rushed toward the back of Moriel. But Moriel was just a turn, and in the blink of an eye they turned into a backward flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two loud noises, and Hilika and Rhode Hart flew back and knocked out two depressions on the rock wall. The body that they had broken was even more distorted like a shackled man. It is only possible to continue to slowly squirm the body that is not shaped and want to restore mobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika, who had just rushed over, had some twists and turns, but the fist had already had a bloody red temperament, while Rhodes Hart It was the sword of the Knights of the Temple, and the black body was completely shrouded in a white sword. This sky full of swords is actually from the hands of a burnt zombie. If the ninety-nine swordsmen in the mainland see this scene, they will never take the sword again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The martial arts of these two people are not weakened compared to before, and Asa is clear that even if they are Lancelot, they must also face such a person. Take all the spirit to deal with. But Moriel just turned and kicked out, then the two flew out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mollier's movements are simple. It’s as simple as a kick, just like kicking two balls. It's just that the simple to the extreme action is fast enough to the extreme, whether it is the Helician or Rod Hart's sword does not play any role. The man flew out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pure and direct action is exactly the same as Gru. It’s just that this black dragon illusionist woman has no vindictiveness to be stronger and faster than Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that time, Rhodes Hart and Hilika got up and attacked. Asael turned and kicked the two of them. Asa had already raised his knife. Fighting and murder have condensed, this is out of combat instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the shape is a woman, this real body is a dragon. This knife can only hurt at most and it will not be too heavy. It is impossible to kill her. Once injured, the remaining situation may not be able to clean up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Moraire, you explain why..." Asa is still back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You ask Akibad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa hears this sentence At the same time, I saw that Moryl’s fist, which seemed to be not too mighty, was hit. Even in his eyes, this fist became a phantom because of the speed. At this speed, he can't dodge, and he can only block at most. He crossed his hands and smothered his arms around his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blocked. This shot of Moriel hit the strongest part of Asa's hands and his body. The temperament that can resist the ogre warrior's blow is instantly broken up. He can only hear the armpits and the arm is not broken, but the next moment he feels the muscles of the whole body. The bones seem to be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A muffled sound. Asa hit the rock wall behind it. Compared with the two fear knights, Asa’s collision is nothing short of strength or strength. At least the strength of this punch has been dispelled by him for a long time, so he did not smash his body like Helicika and Rhodehart, but he felt that he was already rotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could this be the case? Asa’s last consciousness can only reluctantly piece together this sentence. This collision only felt that his brain was broken into dozens of pieces, and it seems that some other muscle organs were mixed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruins of Othello are now a silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white flame of the Holy Light has been completely extinguished, and even a body has not been left on the battlefield that has been washed by the flames. The remains are only tombstone-like debris. This long-time black elf city is now dead as a remnant of thousands of years ago. Both the Black Elf and the Tauren are now free to clean the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a corner of this ruin, a huge pile of rocks smashed. The figure of the Tauren high priest and the figure of the eagle patriarch chief drilled out from the mound. At the moment when the flames of Purgatory Paradise poured down, the Grandma of Tima used all the magical powers to pull up a layer of rock shield on the surrounding ground, covering himself with the basil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is another curse, this level of protection is no different from a layer of paper. Only the flame of the Light of Purgatory Heaven can melt armor and flesh and even any magical protection, but it has no lethal effect on the rock. The earth magic that was refined by the Tema Grand Priest just made him return to life in the flames of the ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eye-devil leader was farther away from the Thamma priest and could not have access to the shield. The magical shield that was condensed with spiritual power only insisted on the half-exhaustive effort under the flame of the curse of the curse, and with his ugly body, he made a flying ash with a half-sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The chores of those churches..." Basil looked around the dead silence, screaming screaming, and crying in the empty ruins. Although I couldn’t see any corpse now, she hid the scream of the sacred sergeant’s rocky hood before she hid in the rock shield of Tima’s high priest. She was drowned by the white waves falling from the sky, and then silently Melt it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of eagle owls is not much, this time the battle is almost out of the nest. At that time, if it wasn't for the Tema Grand priest who took her, she had already lost her anger and rushed to the crack on the top of the cave against the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roller looked at Tima screaming: "I have said that all human beings are treacherous locusts, even the lowest cave people are better than them. Trustworthy. You have to believe the cardinal of the cardinal and cooperate with them..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough." The priest of Tema snorted. The two flames in the huge double bull's eye almost came out. His mood is only worse, worse and more violent than the basil. He almost couldn't help but tear the noisy harpy into two pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it can be tolerated, and the impulsiveness does not directly turn the impulse into action like the ordinary cow, and the situation is calm and calm, which is why he can lead the Tauren to come. The reason for this is that the high priest took a deep breath and said, "It doesn't matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
