			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The princes and nobles of all countries have already reached the kingdom. Tomorrow, they will go to the hunting ground to start hunting and hold a party in the palace this evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geffenhardt 17th character is pure and has no arrogance and arrogance, but after all, it is just a young man who loves to play. It’s his interest to hold this lively party, which is related to the face of the country, so the scene is full of luxury. The best wines and the most exquisite food flow are generally sent to the aristocratic women. They can't wait to change all the family's products into their clothes. The countless jewels are shining under the lights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even the dazzling jewels are no match for the charm of the Marquis. Even now he is not a young and enthusiastic teenager, but still the favorite of all women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true charm will never be lost because of the age of the old. It’s just a natural little insignificant little decoration that appeals to the young girl who doesn’t know how to appreciate men. Only. What's more, the Marquis seems to be the oldest. When the man is exposed, the mature and graceful atmosphere will be the most attractive because of the wind and frost. Coupled with his handsome and handsome appearance, the great reputation and the reputation of the most famous perfume can attract women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis and Asa, who followed him, appeared in the venue and were surrounded by tide-like women. The innermost layer does not hide his interest in men. He laughs with the Marquis without any taboos. There are still a lot of people who are throwing a glare at Asa. They want to be slightly reserved but still difficult to resist the mature charm. The girls and then the outermost talents are purely trying to see the man who is the 6 most romantic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis is familiar with the surrounding ladies and is very skillful and skillful to get rid of them for a while before they get rid of this group of supporters and then take Asa The two came together in the circle of the kings and ministers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the communication between the Duke of Mulak and the people is just a craftsmanship, the craftsmanship is round and clear, and the comparison of the Marquis is immediately revealed because it is too practical. The level and the craftsmanship came out. The Marquis and people's communicative response is that the art has no practicality. Because he does not bother with practicality, he is not afraid of offending people. It is always an eye-catching place. It seems that it is aggressive and it is not worthy of expressing his dissatisfaction with anyone. But this is the charm of his personality. Where. As soon as he talks with someone, he can immediately attract people's emotions with his words and gestures. When he feels it is necessary, he can use a few whimsical words to make the other people’s emotions unrecognizable and unable to counterattack the opportunity of not letting anyone get caught up. He was like a duck in the crowd of the most distinguished guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa still doesn’t like this kind of occasion, but he has been able to notice that his words and deeds are no longer similar to the action of picking things. People look happy and lively. However, it is said that his diplomatic skills, which had been almost revived after the battle between the 5,000 rebels and Oufu, have made him famous. This makes his calm attitude seem to have an extraordinary brilliance. Just like the statue on the altar, even if it looks like it, it will have a powerful momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of Marquis, Asa quickly became the most unpredictable and most important guest in the eyes of these politicians. Many people have turned against him. The peace talks and the dangers of the merchants in their own country are expressed in gratitude and are also interested in the details of this merit. But at this time Asa has resigned that there is something to do right now, and they strongly urged Asa to promise to come to the hunting together tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them went to see the emperor together after the preparations were completed. Participation in hunting is subject to the grace of the Emperor's Majesty, because it is customary for clergy to be unable to participate in such recreational activities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geffenhart XVII was only the beginning to deal with the guests of various countries and then turned around and joined a large group of young aristocratic children. This is a young man who lacks dignity and consciously only loves to play. He is having a good time chatting with Chris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young emperor who was playing a night in the evening was so flustered that he was dressed up in civilian clothes and disguised himself and ran quietly out of the palace to the kingdom. In a casino, he lost some gold coins. This was not a big deal, but a beautiful lady who talked with him a few times said that the young man who was not rich in appearance had lost his temperament and felt insulted and said that the casino was not in a hurry with the casino owner. The big shot also grabbed some gold coins and gave it to the young man who lost his strength. Suddenly the scene was a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the palace, the young emperor squatted to the princess but did not forget to call her directly into the palace. It was not easy to wait until today to finally see the long-lost beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were shocked at first sight. Her Majesty the Emperor immediately hinted that she should not scream that she would have been exposed to the casino. Cris is naturally not in a state of disappointment. The two people talked more and more happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty disturbs the good times of you and this beautiful woman." The Marquis is so unspoken in the face of the emperor, but his demeanor and the charm of his words. Enough to accept. "I and the priests came to you to ask you for the invitation of the kings' palaces. He will attend the hunting conference tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Obviously, I don’t want to be disturbed and nodded. "Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A noble youth suddenly spoke aside and said, "According to the church's rules, clergymen are not able to participate in such activities. The priest may be able to know that he is still swaying to find a prostitute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" All attention including the Emperor’s Majesty They are all concentrated here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s bad. Asa swears. He has recognized this unscrupulous guy who is actually a prime minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis spoke up. He used everyone to see that it was a poor eye to stare at this person. "My dear nephew. How can you talk so badly? Although everyone knows the position of this priest, you are coveted for a long time. Everyone knows your stink. Everyone knows that this priest has taught you but you don't need it. Make such a lie that is not marginal. This is not only to prove your embarrassing failures and embarrassment, but also that your knowledge is still secluded and can't explain other problems like a mouse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The young aristocrats around him had a commotion and whispers. During the period of the prime minister's son, I was inexplicably stunned. Everyone knows that it was the masterpiece of this sage. It is not surprising that such a savage scorpion has been attacked by nonsense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders reprimanded the younger generations to be absolutely unobjectionable. Although I have always known that this uncle's eccentric temper is not easy to provoke, I never imagined that I would actually encounter such an elbow. The face of a prime minister who could not fight back immediately became a pig liver color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis did not pay attention to this distorted scorpion turned and said to the emperor: "To the sire. Bishop Ronis let me stop by to tell you that he will ask Roland The head of the delegation is going to discuss some important matters. Please be sure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay. Let him go and let him go." The emperor immediately nodded to see His expression is almost overjoyed. The head of Roland will be guarded by the emperor when he is on a tour or when there is any activity to take charge of the safety of the emperor. However, his rigorous and meticulously emperor, who is uncomfortable with the taste of the young Geffenhart XVII, has a great hope for tomorrow's hunting, but he is struggling to get rid of the old-fashioned annoying bodyguard. What he can't ask for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis looked worried and continued: "But the safety issue of this kind is worrying... I suggest that as many military veterans as possible bring as many The guards and the squatting together go to protect the safety of the sire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no exemption. It is not a deep enemy, just take the three outside the king. Forty guards are on the line and they are so aggressive.” Geffenhardt 17 has always hated the old-fashioned old guys. And as the Marquis reminded him, he also remembered that they must not let them destroy the atmosphere. "Through my orders, the military ministers will not participate in the hunting conference tomorrow. The VIPs from all over the world will all be talking about the temper of killing and killing, and all the fires will be destroyed in case of breaking the diplomatic service?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis and Asa smiled and thought that it was so easy to arrange all the preparations. As for the head of Roland and other people who might hinder the plan, the main church of Ronis thought of ways to let them leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When turned around, the Marquis suddenly said to the prime minister who hadn’t come over his face: "Dear Modo’s nephew heard that you used to find someone to count this. Is the priest adult?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime minister has a bad face and no opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Didn't pay any attention to this stunned scorpion Marquis turned and patted Asa's shoulder and said softly: "Let's go to these superficial scenes and supporting actors have been set up and let us prepare those real and dangerous props."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening’s magical school’s surprisingly quiet and magnificent cathedral is also hidden in the dark. Only a majestic outline is revealed. Asa and Marquis went to the light under the outline. According to the arrangement of Bishop Ronis, the Cusbert Great God is waiting for them at the door of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cousbert's great sergeant in his forties is lean and has an old face with a pair of seemingly sluggish eyes. He is a man who is known for his sense of justice and responsibility and his reputation. Both have a devout faith and once commanded pastors and magicians to fight in the battles of the pagans. Although his way of dealing with the infidels once made him controversial - he had burnt all the 2,000-year-old pagans alive, but his loyalty and ability to the church still kept him in high position. Some time ago, when Bishop Ronis advocated meeting with Ou Fook, he actually opposed the idea that those dirty and evil orcs would never qualify for the same level as God's people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s too late for the bishop to say that you should come five minutes ago." The great priest looked at the Marquis’ eyes and he was once the Marquis at the School of Magic. The classmates in the class and the style of the Marquis are obviously not welcomed by anyone who believes in piety. He looked at Asa with a stern look and said: "You have to remember that being a cleric 'strict' is an indispensable quality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes." Asa courtesy. In my heart, he gestured to him. This guy seems to be very dissatisfied with Bishop Ronis's promotion of such an unqualified newcomer and often has an opinion on Asa's casual and casual style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s still so old-fashioned that it has always been able to maintain a pure virginity. Isn’t it because the spirit has been suppressed for too long, so it’s so old?” Marquis looked at the big priest. The eyes quickly waved and said: "Oh, forget it. It's boring to be a joke. Let's take us in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are in Cous Under the leadership of Burt, he walked into the cathedral and came to the platform on the front center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge statue in the middle of the Shentai is still so holy and majestic in the dark. The great priest read a weird mantra and pressed a huge idol at the foot of the statue to quietly move away to reveal a hidden door below. There was a lock on the dark door. Kusbert took out the key and opened a long, authentic three-person walk down the tunnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth's dark and humid air is filled with a strange stench. Going down the bottom, this weird smell is getting thicker and the air is getting more and more wet and boring. Asa had the illusion that the three of them seemed to be heading towards a cauldron that cooked the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This smell lingers in this narrow place as if it were a scum of cotton into his lungs. The air of the lizard swamp has been unbearable, but it is simply the taste of everyone in the bedroom. Asa glanced at the Marquis, who was accustomed to the smell of the powdery powder, but now his face is still so elegant as if he were still in the luxurious party. This made Asa feel a little admired that it was really out of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been in the School of Magic for several years. If it is not now, Bishop Ronis let me come. I really don't know that this dungeon is actually in the most sacred cathedral. Li," Marquis said to Asa. "'Under the most holy surface is still the most filthy flesh. 'What do you think of this line?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inham please pay attention to your After all, you are also a magic academy. At least you should be a priest in academic terms. Don’t think that you have the identity of a nobleman, you can talk nonsense.” The big priest who walked in front of him said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis spread the stalls and said with a little regret: "At least the facts I said are based on artistic points. And you should be thankful that I am not a clergyman or must reform the church. The system removes you from these unpredictable old-fashioned guys."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priest turned his head and stared at the Marquis and turned back to continue walking down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, what the hell is this place." Asa could feel a magical wave around him. It was a feeling of passing through a magical array. And with the strange snoring of the magical array that traversed in the air in the ear, the unpleasant smell became more and more intense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am honored to be honored." Asa nodded and had a cold sweat on her forehead. If Bishop Ronis is going to arrest him, he is probably imprisoned in this place now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priest said with a cold voice: "I advise you not to arbitrarily add words to the younger generation." He turned his head and looked at Asa seriously: " You must remember that your sacred identity is not to be disturbed by the gibberish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Asa nodded again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s finally come to the end of the tunnel. Suddenly, a huge space of buzz and stench is coming from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The granite was hollowed out and divided into a cell by a thick steel strip to hold a variety of monsters. A three-headed dog, as big as a horse, violently hit the three giant mouths of the cage and screamed with a scream of madness. In the other cell, a few evil eyes waved tentacles with the big eyeballs of the water tank to make magical light. They wanted to attack these sudden targets, but the magical array of light could not cross the cage was blocked in it. A Medusa twisted his own snake and the lower body of the snake to the cage and looked at it with the legendary petrified person. A huge body in the cage inside is sitting silently above. It is a huge cow-like head. This is the legendary Tauren. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the evil creatures in the distant underground world of Nigan. Even the most famous adventurers rarely see that they are actually held in the church’s dungeon. these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the undead monster is relatively quiet. They don't yell at warriors and zombies, and the white ghosts are aware of the anger of human beings and want to rush over but are constantly being bounced back by the magical array of cages. The meticulous works of these Necromancers have lost their master's control, leaving only a few simple basic consciousnesses. Even the most convenient prisoners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow." I saw so many strange creatures that I had heard about and always wanted to see, and I was amazed. "But why didn't you see the prisoner?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priest said coldly: "The last one committed suicide a few days ago. It is made by the Necromancer. The leader of the pagan organization. However, after being held here, he said that he was not the guild of the Necromancer. He cried and yelled to go out. After being held here for a while, he committed suicide one by one. Some of them were biting their blood vessels. There was another hand on the wall that pulled out his tongue. These dark believers ended up in such a situation that they were given food to the monsters by taking their own bodies and not collecting them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis shook his head and said: "It’s too beautiful. Are you really sure those who are legendary Necromancers?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa went to a few cells inside and asked: "How are these few empty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great God replied: It was a prison prison that had been held for a long time before other undead monsters. Since the establishment of the Magic Academy It’s too long to use this place to imprison the undead monsters. It’s probably not known when it’s been destroyed.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa suddenly felt that the entire dungeon seemed to sway slightly a bit. An incomprehensible strange feeling smashed from the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked around and it seemed to be just an illusion because the Marquis and the great priests did not react. But the creatures outside were suddenly quiet and the zombies and cockroaches in the cell did not move. The dungeon that was just smashed was quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" The big priest was only a little wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked at the deepest part of the dungeon and the strange feeling came from there. The light that he is now in the hands of the great priest is not able to shine into it as if there is a black gas that devours all the light. There is a faint glimpse of the magical array on the stone wall next to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very fine little runes are put together into a larger rune arrangement. The way it is very tight is the magical power of the magical array. It should be amazingly big, but there is no slight feeling here that it should be obvious to the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa pointed to the deepest point and asked the great priest: "Is there something to be held there? Use such a large magical array."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
