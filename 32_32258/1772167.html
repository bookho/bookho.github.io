			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you run away?" Aisi's eyes and mouth were so large that he almost occupied his entire face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nobody thought that the git boy actually took a reel of water and took the scorpion and ran to the other side of the river." Hilton replied indignantly. . No one else looks good in one person's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reel of the water?" Ai Sisi and the old man face each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making a magic scroll is never a simple matter. Behind the cheap tricks that seem to be instant magic, it is unimaginable difficulty and expensive to use the magic that can be used to carefully and accurately use the magic power to store it. The magician who makes the reel must use that magic very skillfully and must pass the magic at his own level. Otherwise, the production may be slightly wrong, and even the life will be accompanied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually a senior magician can make a mid-range magic scroll and a high-end magic scroll requires a big magician to make a top-level magic scroll. The scrolls made by the magic engineering are also worthy of the border town. The magic scroll is made of magic material. The higher the magic level, the more expensive the material is, and the higher the geometrical level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water system magic is not the top but it is not a general magician can use the big road goods to make this scroll of the big magician big 6 There are no more than twenty people and no one asks that they are willing to spend magical materials to make this reel. The price/performance ratio of this reel is almost the same for almost all reels, unless there is a very special and very urgent situation, no one is willing to spend hundreds of gold coins to take two steps on the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it... this kid has a plan? So I prepared a reel of watering?" Ai Sisi tried hard to scratch his head. I guessed the truth of the matter but I couldn’t think of it anymore. "But...how can he know that we are here to rest here? If it is here after the break, he decides... Where does he go to get the scroll... Someone sent it to him? Impossible... What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said that you really have a problem with this woman. You can catch up with why they don't catch up to entangle them?" Hilton stared The pain on Jessica's face shook. "Even if you are not an opponent. But you can't die with two knives. We will keep up with two knives and put them on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You come to pick me up and see if I can't die." The masked woman was playing with the two short swords. Cold-eyed, Hilton glanced at the direction of the man and Druid intentionally or unintentionally. "It’s not just that I can’t run alone.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hilton looked at the two short-swords with blue eyes in the woman’s hand and immediately looked at it. Druid said: "Yes. Anderson, since you can catch up with us so quickly, why don't you rush to it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the transformation, although explosive Very good, but my own physical strength is very poor." Druid reveals a very honest smile. It is really understandable to look at this from the standard middle-aged man's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oop well, okay. One is afraid of a sickle, so that the two guys ran away." Hilton turned his head in angrily. "That kid knows that we are going to the big land in Tula. If he tells the nephew that the nephew leads the Knights of the Kingdom to come to us, what should we do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Druyi said slowly: "I don't think the kid will say it. Even if he says that the Knights of the Shrine will not go to find a helper, since she alone broke into our rally, it shows her heart." High-spirited and disdainful to others. The relationship between Celeste and Queen Catherine has always been not good and the female knight finally said. She wants the honor of the knight to wash her shame. So I think she may I won't find a helper. At least I shouldn't ask the Knights of the Kingdom for help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe? It should be?*. We are not going to the mountains to play with water. We are going Do big things to do big business." Hilton almost jumped up and thought that the two elf girls and the jewels he had asked for Helicel could not be suppressed. "That is the sale of tens of thousands of gold coins. There is no need to lose a little. You may say something maybe. Maybe this sale has ruined my elves and treasures..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Don't say it!" A huge snoring sound like a volcano exploded from the throat of Helicika. He had been sitting on the ground with a gloomy face, and he seemed to be stimulated by Hilton's words. Stand up suddenly. The muscles on his face were all twisted and squirmed, and the muscles were constantly sweeping through the eyes of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the man who was not walking away was still sitting there with a pair of brilliant eyes watching Helicia whispered: "You better calm down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The sight of Sirika immediately fell to the fierce light in the man's face. His mouth has been bleeding from the blood. I don’t know if the teeth are too tight or because I have bitten my tongue or mouth. Suddenly he held his little finger of his left hand with his right hand and then uttered a bang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the muscles on the face of the card shook a little and let go of the hand. The tail finger has been twisted and broken. Under the moonlight, you can see a broken bone breaking through the skin. Revealed. Then he took the ring finger again and heard the same crackling of the goose bump. This was criticized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai Sisi does not understand what is going on in the end. I want to ask questions or stop, but I don’t have the guts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others can see that he is forbearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After holding his index finger, Helicel gasped as if he had just vented it on a woman. The expression on his face finally calmed down. It seems that the murderous murder in the body has finally found a vent and seems to have taken a very difficult hurdle in the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Sandefes." Silika sat down. His present expression was calm as if he had just been bathed and cleaned. Even the sound has a rational taste that I have never seen before. The four fingers of the left hand are twisted like a twist. The bones are still exposed to the blood, but the Hilika didn't care as if it was something that grew on others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s not just this, but the person who said it in his mouth. It was not until I saw him looking at the man that he understood that he was talking to the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Sandefes. I know that this name is a pseudonym just like you just said what you called Sandro. People like you can never There is such a name that I don’t know. But I don’t care who you are.” Helicel sorted out his broken fingers one by one and picked them up to connect the bones of the section to the bones. The sound of tooth acid. But Hilika didn't look at him. His eyes were calm and dignified in a man he called Sandefes, just like a respectable elder. "It’s an old friend of Aisisi, Fodor, who introduced you to the land. At that time, he said that you are the name. I did not ask the old man who had been playing with me for many years. He is Ion Fast. I can trust him with the famous old fritters. The key is that all of us are gathered together for money, so what is your name? Who has done what in the past, etc. The grandson is concerned that I care only one thing is that you are able to Working with me to achieve a common goal so that everyone can get the benefits"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man called Sandefies did not speak. Only silently nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone is sitting here, please listen to me." Helica appealed to everyone as a kindly master. "The meaning of these words is that letting people not blame each other for suspicion does not have any effect. We must know that we all work together for the same purpose for the same purpose. We have already given birth to us. No need to worry about the rest is to concentrate all the spirits to face the future situation. Everyone remembers that we have common interests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are the most What is needed is unity.” Hilika clenched his fist on his face and voice together with a gentle fighting spirit called a textbook-style leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Hilton seemed to be very touched and nodded. Several other people nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Aisisi looked at the whole face of Helica’s mouth with his mouth open like a woodcarving. He suspects that his boss is crazy because of over-stimulation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day at noon, the pedestrian finally arrived at another stronghold of the Shamuthi thief group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s totally different from the mansion near Wangcheng. It’s just a deserted manor in a remote place. Many thieves have come here first. It is expected that the large-scale search and arrest of them did not appear even the ordinary inspections did not wait for other thieves Helicia to immediately convene a meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika first told everyone about their plans. In view of the emergence of traitors, the action must be carried out to the forests of Tula Leone as quickly as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
