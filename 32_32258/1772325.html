			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Shrine are a sword. If it is in peacetime, such elemental creatures have no threat to him. But now the action is not much faster than the tortoise, although the sword in the hand can swing, but the sword that lacks vindictiveness and speed can not cause much damage to the element giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword brings out some sparks from the body of the fire element. The fire element was only slightly stumped, and the tall body was like a lover, cuddling the Knights of the Temple in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of hug is absolutely truly fierce, and the fire element is forced to hold the Knights of the Temple into his body. In the red-yellow flame, only the body of the Knights of the Temple was seen, and the screams of his depression were heard in the air squeezed by gravity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another nearby Knights of the Temple want to get closer to help, but the lightning from the wand’s wand in the hands of the priest once again knocked him to the ground, lightning Even if it is impossible to effectively kill the Knights of the Shrine, it is not difficult to stop their actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the Temple Knights made a loud roar in the same voice, their eyes were full of bloodshot, almost mad. But even if they are mad again, it is useless. In this gravitational field, such tactics are almost specifically designed to deal with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams are getting exhausted, and the darkened body of the Knights of the Temple falls from the embrace of the fire element, and the elements of fire continue to drift to the other Knights of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple have a fissure, and the priests of the Tauren are not easy. The sweat of the Tauren's beans is constantly seeping out. The gravity field actually lasted for a short time, probably only a few minutes or so. According to the plan, he can definitely kill these knights. However, because of the relationship between the Black Elf's reinforcements, the most powerful fire bombs and thunder bombs have been consumed, and a lot of time has been delayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This method of using fire elements alone is fine, but the efficiency is undoubtedly much lower. When the gravity field fails, the reaction of the Knights of the Temple will be known without thinking, so the Niutou priest is also very nervous. Not even easier than the Knights of the Temple. However, he did not dare to send the two elements of fire together. Although the lethality of the light archery is not large, it can be fatal if it is repeated several times in a row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murder is in tension and anger, but killing is more intense than being killed. There was a strange scene in the cave filled with blood and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, three black shadows falling from the sky suddenly fell from the top down. In the bang, the Knights of the Temple and the priests of the Niutou are a glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above is the rock wall of the cave. Under the effect of the gravity field, there is always a rock falling. But these three shadows are not rocks, but people. Except for one of them, the body shape slowly slowed down before landing, it seems to be the role of feathering, and the other two are heavily hitting the rocky ground, causing a loud bang, and the rocky ground is actually pulled out by the two. Two huge pits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is two men who are almost completely naked, a tall and muscular. Muscles are as strong as a muscle fortress. Even the taller Tauren warrior doesn't feel like he is powerful. The other one is much thinner, but it's just a comparison. This shape, whether it's the body bones or the muscles, should be a perfect young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these two men should have been perfectly perfect and now completely distorted. Falling from such a height in such a gravity environment. Even the iron image will be completely deformed, not to mention the flesh. Now their hands and feet are twisted in a strange way, and the bones protrude from the broken limbs, and the flesh pulls open the epidermis. The thinner young man's belly is broken by the rock, and the intestines are leaked. A paragraph comes out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these two men don’t seem to think that this is a big deal, they are very flattering their twisted bones, the deformed muscles are pressed back into the body, and then Stand up again. The action is very skillful, and the most sophisticated craftsmen are playing with their own tools. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not red blood oozing from their wounds, but a black, viscous liquid that emits a strange smell and even masks the burnt smell that originally filled the cave. And bloody smell. Moreover, the liquids that originally exuded the body surface were sucked back from the wound by the bodies of the two people, and the broken wounds were restored. Can have such a move, such ability, these two can not be said to be human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the man who used the feathers when he was down. From this point of view, he should be a living person. His upper body is naked and his waist is slanted with a dark knife and two pockets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple saw a sigh of relief as they saw his face. Lancelot’s face was white and his pupils shrank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man did not pay attention to Lancelot and the Knights of the Temple, but went straight to the black dragon that had completely collapsed there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white vindictive light illuminates on his body, and every step falls with a loud bang and rocks. Even in this gravitational field, his movements are still not too slow, just a few steps to the huge body of Moriel. He raised his hand and pressed it on the dying Morrill, and then a white magical light flashed on the black dragon's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the previous man’s move was just to surprise everyone, then his next act was frightening everyone and it was extremely frightening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing? Stop?" The Knights of the Temple and the priests of the Nguyen were screaming in extreme surprise and panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A layer of white light, the huge wound on the shoulder of Moriel has slowly stopped bleeding, and gathered, although compared with the huge wound, this close The magnitude is negligible, but that is really a cure. What the man has to do is not necessary to explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not just white magic, but at least the bishop-level white magic recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mollier has been lying there for a long time, no sound. Even though she hasn't really died yet, she is only a corpse in the minds of the Knights of the Temple and the head of the priest. But the white magic of this man undoubtedly corrects the concept of their hearts, and then the advanced white magic is useless to the body, and Moriel is still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the man took another deep breath, and a layer of green light came to the body of Moriel. The green light and the undulating chapters of the white magic are not mutually exclusive. Instead, they are immersed in the body of the dragon. The recovery speed of the wound on the shoulder of Moriel suddenly increases. Even everyone can hear the sound coming from the dragon mouth. Slight breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple, the priests outside the cave, they heard this gasping, this gasping seems to be sprayed on their heart, feeling the blood of the whole body The nerves are all bitten by the dragon. That is still alive to prove that the recovery is a sign of recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the magical fluctuations in this man’s hand did not stop there, but continued to be sent to the dragon body. This man does not seem to want to save Morrison's life, it seems to directly want to cure her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is absolutely not allowed, no matter who is the same. The fire element that had already floated to the knight of the shrine suddenly turned to the man and rushed over. Even the fire element that was originally protected by the Niu Tau priest rushed out together. The wand in the head of the priest priest also broke out with a lightning strike to the man. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;趁This opportunity, including all the shrine knights who have fallen to Wellske, all shot, but the goal of these light arrows is not outside the cave The ox priest, but the man next to the black dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who can do this at this time, and who has done such a thing, only Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of the magical power of white magic and the restoration of natural magic, the original magical power of Asa’s body rushed into the body of the black dragon, healing The huge wound caused by the Holy Cross sword. He felt the vitality of the black dragon's body on the verge of severing and finally reconnected under his own magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa feels the attack from behind, he did not evade concession, let the light of the Knights of the Knights shine on his body, the white temperament moment It has skyrocketed and hardened the three arrows. He did not move in place, his hand was still placed on the body of Moriel, and the magic power was continuously sent out. At the same time as the archery, he hit the lightning of the priest. But in the face of his full-open temperament, this mid-level spell has no effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red flame giant has already floated behind them at this time, and the agility of such an elemental giant in this gravity field is absolutely unmatched. Asa still did not move, let the flame giant open his arms and wrap himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
