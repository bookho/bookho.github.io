			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tima High Priest seems to have been touched too, and the huge bulls seem to have some sparkling light, and the sound is shaking. "Thank you so much, let me have the honor to join you in this great cause. I swear in the name of the horned devil, I and my people will never let you down, the dirty and despicable Soon, the Glorious Castle will be turned into ruins at our feet soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The negotiation was carried out smoothly and quickly, without any bargaining and sorrow, about the Tauren and The fact that the harpy was joined by Oufu was quickly agreed between the Lord of the Oufu and the Tauren priest. The enthusiasm of Sedros has always been high, and the face has always had a radiant radiance and smile. The priest of Tema has always been very moved. Then the high priest of Tema immediately took the Wyvern to the junction of Tatulia and Nigan. The border, waiting for the people who migrated from Nigan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Wyvern is carrying the tall priest of Tema, the Sedros on the ground slowly becomes a small point, and then I can’t see it again. When it was clear, the face of the Tema Grand Priest had been very gentle, and the expression of a poet-like expression had calmed down. Although the way of human communication is disgusting, the Tema Grand Priest is no stranger. He can become a high priest and almost become a ruler of Nigan. The Tema Grand Priest has to admit that it is because he learned from human beings. Enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good place. The Tima High Priest did have to admit this in a heartfelt manner. When he came here with a delivery reel, he was almost shocked. He was not convinced when he listened to the plan of Sedros more than a decade ago. But I didn't think he did it, and it was so successful. If you are in terms of achievement, no matter what kind of hero can't match him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, his defense must also outweigh the defense of anyone. The Tima High Priest agrees with Sedros' previous evaluation of the hero. He is successful, high-ranking, and powerful. He is definitely a person who is deeply tempted by things like morality. Of course, what friendships and the like are the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sedros can welcome himself like this, showing such generosity and enthusiasm. If he is really out of friendship and feelings, the high priest knows that it is impossible, just as he himself may not really express gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the war with the church, Oufu, who is always on the verge of a sudden, thousands of desperate Taurens and eagle maidens are naturally a resource that cannot be met. The reaction of Sedros was completely in the expectation of Tima. He knew this result before he came here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything in the eyes of a truly successful superior is only useful and useless. This is a very simple difference, so it is very simple to predict their response in many cases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course this is the same for the Tima High Priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the main office of the city, the face of Oufu Cheng, who had just sent away the Thamma priest, did not have the enthusiasm and radiance on his face. He took it out of the table. A map, a hand throwing a hand, the magic of the air to the map, the map is flat and neatly hung on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The map is large. Almost all of the walls are occupied and made very well. Sedros himself is the most famous adventurer, blogger and cartographer on the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the map, in the middle of Oufu’s position in the middle of the map, there was a ten-digit number in chalk. Sedros thought a little and picked up one. The pen has written a "plus two" behind the ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The southwest corner of the map, representing the place of Nigan, Sedros did not hesitate to write a zero-numbered original number. Then his eyes stayed on a large site between Nigan and Oufu. It is a large and small religious country headed by Celeste, headed by Erasia, and naturally has its own figures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These figures represent the country’s national strength and combat capability, although except for Erasia, none of these countries’ data can approach the “Ten "But it's a lot more than it is, it's close to thirty." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this data has been around for this time, until now, until the back of them, Nigan has been covered by the zero, the role of these data Only fully played out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s all calculated. It takes half a month to settle down, it will consume about 30% of the productivity of this month. If it is settled, the average monthly expenditure will increase by 20%. There is no way to assess productivity. I really don't know what the Tauren and the eagle can do." The door opened, and Bolugan came in and looked at the book on his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy of the city is still very short and five short, and it is already a pie-like face, but the hair that has been flying across the grass has changed. It’s neat and smooth, and the body is no longer the cloaked clothes that haven’t been washed for a long time, but a set of uniforms that seem to have some prestige. It seems to be more like a city owner than a regular dressed Sedros. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no tailor in the city of Oufu, the orcs don’t need this kind of occupation, this is the time when Bolugan’s own busy time is taking time to send the scroll to Einfas What is specifically done, completely imitated is the uniform of the officials of the Ian Fest Empire, but the best clothes to wear on his body can not play any real effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dress was originally only the specific equipment when he went to the Tower of Tooth, I don’t know if it was too satisfying for his own shape, then slowly this It became the uniform he had been hanging on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't do anything for them. You can fight, you can kill people." Sedros replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. The Tauren’s combat power is actually above the ogre. Although the eagle is weak but flexible, if it can cooperate with the two-legged dragon Properly, Oufu’s air superiority can no longer be shaken...but...” Bolugan’s habitually scratched his head and immediately healed his hair, which continued. . "But... it can only be said to be useful if it can be used......."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No matter if it is an eagle The demon or the Tauren are all guys whose character is violent, and it is difficult to integrate into the city. It is easy to stimulate racial contradictions and conflicts. And they all have their own leaders. The two leaders are still huddled together... .. If it is okay in peacetime, but in such an extraordinary period... Sedros adults, I don’t think it is a good idea to let them join Oufu.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know all of this..." Sedros sighed. "But without them, I really didn't have enough control to resist the church's upcoming offensive..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But after the last defeat of the church coalition It didn't take long, and even if the troops were gathered again, the number would never..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The number will be twice that of the previous one." Delos sounds dull and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They don't have to worry about Nigan anymore. All the defense lines in the west of the country can be put into the battle of the wild highlands." His fingers fell on the map. The location of the root, there is only one big zero. "Double force, and definitely go all out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we can wait until General Gru to stand in the Sandefes The high-quality magic material can be sent from the source, and the tower of the tooth can help us make the reel. At that time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's too late." Delos turned to look at the Bolugan adults and sighed long. He no longer has the spirit of the past, the wrinkles on his face never seem so deep, the silver hair beard has no luster, only the old man's pale. "Magnus will never give us this opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The spies on Celeste come to the news?" ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. It was the news that Tima gave me the cow. He told me that Magnus actually used the purgatory paradise in Nigan." Sedros smiled a bit and shook his head slightly. "That was one of the two cursive scrolls that the Pope and the three Cardinals spent two hundred years ago had spent their life magic, but only one copy completely reversed the battle between Elazia and Nigan. The rest of the book has been preserved until today. This should be considered the most memorable treasure of Celeste. I was always worried that Magnus would use it when dealing with us, but he used it. Niegen, when the Tauren and the Black Elf fought together, wiped out the main forces of both sides."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great..." Bolugan’s adult Zhang Da can plug into the mouth of an ogre fist and nod. "Since I am willing to use such a powerful killer in Nigan, the real purpose is actually Oufu. He really will not give us any chance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
