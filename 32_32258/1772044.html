			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis’s hand has been soaked in sweat. He began to worry that he would not even hold the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has never been so nervous. He doesn’t even know that his hands will sweat like this when he is nervous. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of most people, the Duke of Mulak is a high-ranking, savvy and capable person. He is only a very respectable politician minister. But he knows that even the Duke of the pioneering field will never be inferior to any of the generals of the empire. If the Duke is more qualified to be among the top five in the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke just gave him and him a command like this - not to care about the people they really want to catch, watching the Duke himself, all the hands immediately concentrated Attack the person attacked by the duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not ask the Duke who is in need of such a big scene to deal with. He absolutely believes that the Duke's judgment is definitely an imaginary opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time in his life that he has faced a huge unknown and more likely to imagine dangerous things. He has been steadily and radiant since he was born. Brilliant life experience. So he is nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tototo has a rhythmic knock on the door. The Duke shouted intimately to the inside: "Mr. Andrew's old man, I am back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis clenched the hilt and the palm of his hand Then the so closed hilt seems to have become a sweaty squid. Croce is afraid that it will suddenly slip away from his hand during the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke turned his head and looked at him with a faint sigh of relief: "Relax."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g Lauvis felt that his forehead was full of cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not nervous. Can't be nervous. Clavis repeatedly emphasized his own demands on himself. What kind of person is I in front of so many people? How can I be the best, the strongest, the most promising, the most capable person? It’s just that it’s nothing to be nervous about catching a soldier. In my heart, I repeat the plan of the Duke just thinking about every step I should take. When and how to use it, how to calmly speak and speak out in the case of an unexpected opponent<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The big wooden door out of the '嘎吱' is called to open the door is a pale young man who is in his 20s and looks pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this face, the Duke of Mulak was a bit surprised. When the door was all open and saw the inside, the Duke of Mulak felt very surprised and even surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And looking at this face that made him tossing and dying in the past two months is more worried than the most affectionate lover. It’s like squirting a fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the one he saw two months ago. The soldier who learned that part of their plan is more important than himself in the eyes of his fiancée. The man is the inferior citizen who makes mistakes in his own mistakes. And now the Dalits are more daring to be bright. The lobby is just right in front of him and looks at them like a group of unexpected guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his anger, he pulled the sword and he must first despise this blame for his sin. But it is a strange thing that the sword has just been unsheathed. Everyone, including the Duke, put down their arms and kneel down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a space in the big house and a carriage was parked there. There are two pastors and an old man next to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very thin old man's cheeks on both sides of the cheeks with a very flat amplitude to form a narrow face so that the original small eyes look appropriate. There is a dark black eye bag under the eyes that looks like it hasn't been resting for a long time. The old man wore a set of pure white satin robes, embroidered with a white gold thread on the chest, and a crown worn on the head of the cross also had a cross set with gems. The body of this house under the scent of this dress has become very solemn and solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis hurriedly put down the weapon on one knee and the standard of the standard. A blessing ceremony was held: "God is with you in the Lord Bishop of Ronis." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing with the Dukes?" Bishop Ronis looked at the weapons in the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke actually can still look at Asa and say: "We just suspect that this young man is a fugitive, so I am going to arrest him and go to interrogation." I saw the young man in front of him. Since the scorpion can be loaded with a hunchback, the face can also be loaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Bishop Ronis looked at Asa’s eyes as if a pair of candlelights in the darkness asked: "Young people in the name of God and your own Honor vows, are you really a fugitive as he said?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa shook his head: "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Bishop Roones nodded and smiled and turned to the Duke and said, "He said he is not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Duke nodded . Clovis's forehead has been immersed in cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think you may have misunderstood or have something wrong." Bishop Ronis gave the Duke a conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is we made a mistake." The duke repeated. The cold sweat of the side of Klauvis has already flowed down the forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the misunderstanding has been clarified, then there will be no trouble in the future?" asked Bishop Ronis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be no more trouble." The Duke replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Duke of the Duke, you know that I have no interest in military and politics and I don’t want to have any interest." The bishop is like chatting with old friends. Very emotional tone. "So I don't want people around me to be involved. You have to know that this is the place of the School of Magic. The people here are also the people of the School of Magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I asked the bishop to be reassured. We retire.” The Duke’s adult was like a gentleman who had just gone to the wrong room and said very politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After exiting the big house demobilization unit, Clauvis said to the Duke: "The bishop is designed to let us in. He cares for the guy."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke nodded and the coach of the Bishop of Ronis did not stop outside and deliberately got into the house, fearing that they would not be able to do so after they saw the carriage and temporarily retreated. Only when they are arrogant and want to do something can they say that they are dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strictly speaking, the bishop is not in real power, he can neither adjust taxes nor mobilize one soldier. But even if he has the right to be like the emperor, he will never dare to fool him. Since he said that he didn't want the soldier to have any trouble, he really couldn't have any trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis feels that things are running out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke asked him: "Do you say that the soldier will tell the bishop to the situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Clovis shook his head: "I don't know what you said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke also shook his head: "I don't know if I only have to ask him." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to ask?" Clovis was puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just ask," the duke said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis still didn’t understand much, but looked at the Duke’s calm look. He felt that things would still be clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke said: "From a certain point of view, there are only three people in the world. One is someone who has nothing to do with you. You don't have to care. Don't bother to pay attention. The other is your enemy. This kind of person can't have too much. Once you have it, you must scoop the roots." He looked at Clauses. "But what if you have an enemy that you can't solve?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Use all my power to defeat him." Si is bravely frowning and full of fighting spirit. He is already thinking about how to explain to the bishop after the incident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke shook his head in disappointment: "You should find a way to turn him into a third person - a friend. The more such people, the better." Especially the ones you can't deal with."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
