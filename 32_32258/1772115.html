			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no cloud in the sky to stop the sun from shining in the morning. For the gods of nature, it seems that even the air overflows the sacred taste. The believers came from all directions to go around the forest to participate in their dream of being able to unite with the god of nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in this grand sacred scene, the local official of Airy is very ignorant. He gathers all the people in the city who can use it, even including sweeping the floor. In the total of the tax collection of the night patrol, all the people who can be mobilized and the three thousand regular troops dispatched from the king are set on the main road leading to the forest to prevent the believers from advancing. At the beginning, the local officials’ troops were able to cope with the three or five groups of believers to stop them from advancing. But as the noon approached, the mutual calls of the believers continued to gather more and more conflicts became more and more intense. The two sides have already started to work. The entire Airy area was confusing like a pot of porridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two thousand soldiers have already rushed to the grass in front of the whispering forest. There are already many believers in the villages that are relatively close to each other. The soldiers drove the believers away and were ready to begin destroying the stone statues. But when the soldiers finally pulled a stone statue down and prepared to break it, all the believers were angry and they began to attack the soldiers with things like stone branches. At the same time, many believers who came here from other paths continued to come. As the number of believers increased, the soldiers even began to be surrounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone stopped." Asa saw that the situation was not yelling from the soldiers to the top of a stone statue. "Let everyone listen to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out of the way." Thousands of believers who have been filled with grass shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although knowing what to say is probably useless, but now there is no other way to say that Asa shouts: "Everyone is a local villager. Everyone thinks carefully about how this forest has existed here for a long time. Why is it now a forest of natural gods? This is a scam."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Pull the nonsense bastard down to kill him.” The believers began to throw stones and mud on him and climbed onto the stone statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The bang of a loud bang of a stone statue in the fire of Asa’s fireball blasted four scattered stones and the blast of the blast caused many believers . The noisy believers were scared by this and they all calmed down and approached Asa. Everyone can see the consequences of what it was like if it was on his own head. Even Asa’s own shots were unexpectedly urgent, but the threat of violence seemed to be much more effective than persuasion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are more unexpected things happening right away. Some black liquid leaked out of the stone statue that was broken in the upper part of the body. The nearby believers hurriedly licked their noses and fled the liquid. The smell was not just stinky. It was like a needle stuck in the nose and tied to the brain. Even the tears were smoked. come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you see what kind of great natural god you are talking about is this filthy thing?" Asa was a little shouting out loud. "Tell you, this is a trap. What kind of natural god is actually the lie of the Necromancers of the Necromancers"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shameless!" A sudden burst of sound The majestic and full of temperament only pressed Asa's voice from the sound and momentum. "Do you think that I don't know that you used a mean means to pollute our patrons like you are now deceiving everyone?" The white prophet of the prophet did not know when suddenly appeared on the edge of the forest not far from the righteous words. Integrity seems to be the incarnation of justice and light, and scorns the demon who stands on the stone statue to confuse the people. "This man sneaked here last night and sneaked at our guardian stone. Everyone saw that these nobles and officials actually came up with such a despicable way to smash our gods and want to destroy our faith. Do you think we can't see? "Is it coming out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s coming. I’m still looking for you.” Asa jumped down the stone statues and the believers didn’t have time to react and he was hit by him all the way. In a few steps, I rushed to the side of the prophet to seize this. Then the believers did not react and turned and ran to jump back to the stone statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah the prophet adults." "Quickly let the Prophet adults." Now near noon, the believers have been filled with the tsunami-like shouts of this grass. The sound made Asa’s ear hurt. But he is not worried that he thought from the last night that he would be able to expose the shackles made by this necromancer to everyone. He always thought that the Necromancer would probably not let this revealing the secrets, but he could not think of him now. I got it myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assati lived in the clothes of the prophet and pushed him half-lifted in his hand and shouted: "All of you are watching this is the prophet you have always respected. He is actually the embarrassment made by the Necromancer. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I can’t think of the corpse that is about to collapse, but it’s not only able to say it, but it’s still so loud and solemn, it’s wonderfully one-of-a-kind. Asa pushed to the end of the road: "He has used the sorcerer like me to pollute our statue. I am going to die immediately. But everyone must not be miraculous because of my death. The miracle of the god of nature will still be at noon. Time to show you that you will still lead everyone into the realm of harmony between man and nature. Please be sure to stick to your beliefs. The rest of the words have become like the snoring of a goose. It finally has completely rotted in the throat. The prophet of the prophet fell off his shoulder. Asa lost his hand, and the prophet, who had been so badly smashed, fell to the ground and fell apart. The worms lurking in his body crawled apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strange death is even bigger than the last words of the prophet. The believers on the entire grass began to boil over countless stone mud pieces and flew towards Asa. Soon the whole scene was in a state of extreme chaos. A chaotic fight began. The believers desperately robbed the weapons and killed them as soon as they were robbed. Even if they didn't grab them, they used their fists and teeth. The soldiers faced many times more and the mad-like believers had already left Asa’s orders behind them. They only waved their weapons and defended themselves. Then they slashed and killed them to any believers who approached themselves. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is anxiously but helplessly watching the scene under his feet. In this sunny sunshine, the whole world is like a mad scream and shouts. Filled with the grass, a crowd of ants like ants screamed at each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more people gathered in the face of these tens of thousands of believers and local officials who are obviously powerless. Asa knows that there are more Christians outside the grass who are gathering under these stone statues and waiting to be eaten and eaten. He was overwhelmed by the fact that he was watching a stone flying around him hitting his back. He was dizzy and almost let him fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly a strange noise came out of the forest and it was not obvious at first, but soon all the people on the grass heard it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very dull sound. It seems that a lot of heavy objects collide with each other and slowly move from the depths of the forest towards the grass and the ground begins to tremble slightly. . The forest of the god of nature, which has never been swaying, has come from such a change. Many believers stopped to tear it and look to the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is getting closer and closer to the sound of the scene when the soldiers are stopped at the edge of the forest. All the people were stunned and watched as a giant tree-like giant walked step by step with his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the miracle of the god of nature!" I don't know which believer first shouted out of self-righteousness. All believers are still sitting in the same place. under. The remaining soldiers stood inexplicably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these tree giants have not expressed any concern for the worship and respect of these human beings. They step by step as if they are struggling to go to those stone statues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The believers began to sit devoutly but until some believers stepped on the footsteps of the dead wood guards and screamed that the believers saw how their comrades were. At the foot of his idol, it became a bit of muddy. This began to wake up and the believers who stayed on the trail of the dead wood guards hurriedly fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you leave the whispering forest, the more the stagnation of the guards, the more stiff and sluggish it is. They moved step by step to the side of the stone statue and waved their wooden arms to hit these silent sculptures. All the people in the muffled bumps of the bumps looked at them and they had completely understood their expectations and their understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Only Asa was shouting happy. I couldn’t think of a desperate time when there was such a turn. If he could, he really wanted to hug Luya and kissed him on the little face. A dead wood guard is coming to his stone statue, Asa is afraid, and the pool fish hurriedly jumped off the stone statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the action of the dead wood guards is very difficult, the power of the hit is still not human imaginable. There are several stone statues that have begun to break and ooze black as well. The sewage smells like a smoked person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stone statue of ‘啪啦’ was finally completely destroyed by the attack of the dead wood guards. The attack of the dead wood guards is still continuing to see these things. All plans to destroy the two Necromancers will soon go bankrupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of sound sings from a corner of the crowd as if it were a slurred person. This strange voice is prominent in the group of believers who are all overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sound of those stone statues finally moved. But it was completely different from the quick action of last night. The movement and behavior of the stone statue seemed to be more laborious and slower than the dead wood guards. It seemed that the old people who were all aging and dying were moving their stiff hands and feet. I want to avoid the attack of the dead wood guards as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All are giving me away." Asa yelled at the stunned believers around and looked around in the crowd. A strange voice. He knew that this was the night of the Necromancer who was mixing in the crowd to manipulate the gargoyle. Now the slow-moving movement of these gargoyles is the performance of the lack of magical power. It is easy to get the operator out and solve everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead wood guards dragged the slow pace to chase the slower gargoyle and caught up with the thick wood branches and continued to tap the muffled sound. In addition, several gargoyles ooze black liquid in their bodies. But as the distance from the whispering of the singer is farther away, the movement of the dead wood guards is slower and the distance from the gargoyles is gradually opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is finally here. A common appearance in the crowd is usually dressed in a very ordinary old man who is kneeling on the ground and open his hands to sing the eccentric curse. He shouted: "There are all around." The old man flew over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man slammed his eyes and a pair of turbid scorpions were all stinging. He jumped from the ground with agility that was not commensurate with his age, and he grabbed a believer around him and threw it at Asa. When the believer had just flew out, he also called the half-shoulders and feet in the air and moved * but then there was no sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa rushed to the side and slammed into the ground and bounced off and smothered and sneaked away from the face-to-face believer. He didn't dare to fly bravely or kicked open or even caught something. He saw this trick from Sandru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devotee who was used as a weapon smashed into the back of the believer and splashed out the black juice. The crucified believers screamed and rolled on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Necromancer uses magic to confront him. He knows that he is far from this level. He must be close to fight. Asa has already rushed to the front of the old man. The fist waved out. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man retired from the body and flew up and suddenly rose into the air and floated in the air more than ten meters high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flight is one of the most advanced air magic people will not be very rare. Almost every magician who masters this magical rule of humanity will add a ‘big’ word to his name. But if they can see that the old man is silent and doesn't make a manuscript, don't think that this most advanced magic is as free and natural as the lowest-end road, I am afraid that most of them will automatically re-name from the magic apprentice. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa didn’t care about these fireballs, and he was rushing to the dead wizard in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man just fluttered like a feather. This huge fireball that was enough to turn him into minced meat just flew over a meter beside his body. The judgment of the fireball and the grasp of your own movement are all wonderful. It is just like the ball that the child gently throws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the old man did not feel anger and anxiety on his face because of this heavy lifting. Because he had to distract himself to use the flying dodge gargoyle movement has completely stopped the dead wood guards and catch up with the continue to attack on most of the already scarred gargoyles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is not in a hurry to stare at the sky, the Necromancer moves so many huge stone statues that is not easy, as long as it still maintains flying He will never be able to manipulate the gargoyle again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the dead wood guards continues to grow in the air and the smell of the juice in the body of the gargoyle is getting thicker and thicker in the air. There were two gargoyles broken down in the karaoke. The annihilation of these gargoyles is only a matter of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
