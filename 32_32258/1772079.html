			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only difference between Asa and the dead is that he is more angry. He has been in a coma for a few days in bed. Xiao Xiao has been in front of the bed for the past few days, she is taking care of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone in the thief also asked where the couple of them went to the half-orc boss and said that the urban masters here asked them to stay to discuss some important things. . They used their imagination to speculate that they must have been arguing about the benefits of being alone and the owner of the city. They were indeed knowledgeable and then left with the goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa has moved from the house without a roof to another room. This matter has not been publicized. After all, the city owner also needs to maintain the dignity of the law. The theft of whatever reason should be sent to the huge gallows on the square. The city of Cedros also only said that this person was hurt by a friend of his own in his magical experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therapeutic spells can finally be used on **. No system magic is not used by Cedros. Although he can't study a lot of martial arts because he studies too much, as long as he doesn't use it, his healing spells are not inferior. Any high-level priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then a higher level of treatment can treat only ‘injury’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bones and muscles of his hands and chest have been broken. Even the most brilliant craftsmen can’t make those pieces smaller than the rice grains. The muscles of the group were separated and put together to break back. Many of the broken ribs had already damaged the internal organs and the skull was completely cracked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Cedrus can hardly believe that a person’s body can still survive without such injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed a serious misunderstanding and a misunderstanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Otaru also worked with the thieves to carry the stolen goods, then you will see the city of Sedros if Asa is not so stubborn to use himself. The way to solve this problem if he can discuss this matter with Xiao Yan if his fighting spirit is not so strong, he can explain it a bit when he is caught or simply surrender as long as one of the things is not born such. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Cedros came to see Asa’s situation today and still shook his head in a sullen face. Through conversations with Otaru, he knew that this was indeed a misunderstanding. Although it still can't explain why this young man would wear the Ghost of the Ghost, why would he steal the book but be willing to put a leaf of the world tree that all the magicians dreamed of to save people? It would not be the Society of the Dead. a member of. And the appointment instrument of the bishop is not forged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros also sees what kind of relationship the two are. It also makes him pay attention to him and tries to ask Xiaoxuan: "If he has been awake What should I do? It seems that your marriage contract is not far away?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When he wakes up, I will stay here. I will not go anywhere." Xiao Yan answered very plainly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sedros is silent. Xiao Yan’s tone is not the kind of sturdy and sloppy * If it is so good, it will always leak. * The point will always be a short period of time. After the impulse, it will naturally calm down. But the resoluteness in this plainness shows that she has accepted the reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If other people are still very appreciative of such men and women, she is the daughter of the Duke’s adult and she carries many other things. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros said in a meaningful tone: "Do you know that it is very unfair to you in this way? If you can’t wake up for a lifetime Are you planning to spend a great life on him? You are still young and have a lot of good futures."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;小懿 shaking his head. "I used to be comatose. He saved me. Now I can't save him at least to accompany him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But what you do now Everything he knows is nothing. You are just deceiving yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small sly just said: "This is my own decision."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiao Yan did not speak and slowly fed a spoonful of honey water into Asa's mouth. There is no expression on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros looked at her and sighed and turned and went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt that he was a very annoying person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s necessary to say that you have to do this because you hate it. If she really wants to stay, the most troublesome thing is probably not the Duke, but herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly an official ran from the direction of the city hall and said to him: "The thieves who came out a few days ago by the city owner returned only a few of them. There is a huge fire-breathing monster in the wasteland that is coming here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Monster?" Cedros' eyebrows wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedrus at the gate of the City Hall removed an arm from the pony tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is evidence that a thief who is inferior to the horse is struggling. The thieves were awakened by strange noises on the ground at night. They saw a behemoth coming towards them through the moonlight, and they started to run away. The thieves who were slightly hesitant and slowed down were all involved in the flames of the monsters and only a few survived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sedros carefully observed the arm. The arm is very intact and the section is very neat. It seems to be cut down by the knife and axe. Only the cross section of the bone above is black and the hand is pinched and shattered like a dry bread. There is no natural flame that can cause such damage to the human body. It burns the whole person to ashes but leaves the arm that has just been exposed to the flame intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This corrosive flame should be the effect of dark magic. And what can actually spit out the magic flame? Although he probably knows that the Necromancer is doing a ghost, he does not see what kind of method is used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros began to experience the strangest things in the big six and four travel adventures in his teens, and even saw the legendary dragon in the underground world. I have been to the Descartes Valley and the Necromancers. And he also likes to read books. He has been to the famous library. He has been able to see all kinds of books in the famous library. He can be regarded as the most knowledgeable person with the most knowledge. . If there is anything that he doesn't even know, then it can only show that this thing has never appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When did you meet the monster?" Cedrus asked the few remaining thieves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The night before three days." The old thief Buddha answered. He was the fastest of the few, and almost ran to the horse when he heard the sound, and some people took up arms and looked around. People seem to be living for a long time and want to continue to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the words of the thieves, it can be judged that the degree of the monster does not seem to be fast, but it should not be far from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedrus and Gru teamed up to the swamp in the northeast of the city of Orford. This is the end of the lizard swamp that extends into the wasteland and is used as a lizard. Used in separate residential areas. The two men rode a two-footed dragon here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just the two-legged dragons here are still quietly domesticated bulls and sausages. Lizard people generally do not participate in other affairs in the city of Oufu. Their task is to experiment with these animals in this swamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of the Big 6 has never been tamed with such a record of even such a person has never dared to have such a thought. These are the extremely dangerous animals that live in the most dangerous areas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild cow is a buffalo unique to the lizard swamp. At first glance, it is a cow's appearance, but it is two meters high and four meters long and several thousand kilograms. The outer surface is covered with not a fur, but a thick layer of large scales of scales and a battle axe is also difficult to cause effective damage. Although it is a herbivore, its temper is more fierce and violent than any carnivorous animal. Its enormous strength and volume is definitely one of the most dangerous beasts in the Big 6. And because the poisonous weeds in the swamps are often eaten, the gas accumulated in the stomach of the animals can be spit out from the mouth at any time. The damage this kind of gas has on human skin is similar to what an alchemist makes called 'sulfate'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And only the two-legged dragon can incorporate the bulls into their recipes. These huge flying animals have unimaginable power and enough to catch a barbarian in the air and then throw it away. Repeat this step until you kill the bulls and then eat them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as they have these hugely dangerous combat forces, no army will dare to act rashly here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the city of Cedros will have the courage and whimsy to domesticate these things. He clearly knows all the habits of these strange creatures from the book and then domesticates other animals from humans. In the history of the process of taming these beasts. Only he was able to get the lizard people to get the eggs and cubs of these animals from the swamp and then domesticate them in the peculiar environment of the swamp. It has only been successfully domesticated in a few years, but only a few of them are very useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the amazing power of the Wyvern, even with a Cedrus and Gru plus a lizard, the driver is completely relaxed and flying. The degree is beyond the reach of horses. So only a small half day, Sedros saw the monster mentioned in the mouth of the thieves from the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that? A big bat? Is it like someone?" Shandrew frowned. The three of them could not see them in the woods in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is a domesticated Wyvern. I can’t think of anyone who can use this as a flying tool. It’s a very interesting little trick." Ved Nina is also a bit surprised. But it does not affect her optimistic mood. "It seems that the head of the orc city-state has received news to see our great masterpiece. I don't know what he felt after seeing this masterpiece that would turn his city-state into a gray."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a look at Cedrus can be sure that this is a monster enough to turn the entire Ou Fucheng into ashes. He felt that the magical fluctuations that surround him were unimaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flight down and take a closer look." Cedrus said to the lizard driver. The lizard man pulled the reins and the two-footed dragon screamed toward the corpse dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vicinity of the corpse dragon, passing through the Cedrus to see the numerous bodies that make up the monster's body also feel the magical energy contained in these bodies. Such a monster is indeed made by the Necromancer, but such a huge and perfect magical creature is completely in his imagination. It's not just powerful but a perfect blend of several completely different kinds of magical power. His profound knowledge and deep understanding of magic made him fully aware of these magics, so he was even more shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodies are not ordinary bodies or zombies but living bodies. Only those who have the culmination of physical magic and dark magic can make corpse changes. That is to completely burn all the vitality left in the human body in a very short period of time. The body of an ordinary person can have an amazing fighting power against a senior soldier in a short time. There are hundreds of thousands of such corpses here, which were originally an army's combat power, but now it is only the body of this monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shape of this monster, he also sees that it is the shape that the dark legendary ** ‘Dark Dragon’ should be morphed. The image that was originally only a magical force will automatically dissipate after the spell is released, but now it is integrated with the hundreds of living corpses. It is not just the appearance but it is indeed the rushing dark magic power flowing between the countless bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one that shocked him the most was the monster itself. In a sense, this is actually a living creature. The rot is the hands and feet of the corpses that stand out on the surface of the corpse dragon, but the parts that are close together to form the corpse dragon still retain the original appearance. Even the skin of those corpses still has the unique luster of the living body. . The living corpse can only be kept for a short time but this is obviously not a monster that has just been created. This is a kind of method that combines the highly activated corpse as a medium and the magic of the 'Dark Dragon' as a whole to form a magical cycle and then give the whole body a body when the vitality of the living body is extremely burning. Use life to maintain its power. The amazing magical power and vitality of this monster merge into each other to form an endless cycle that allows it to spurt the devastating flame almost as if it were a creature's breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every magic is so victorious and the balance between the various magical forces is just right, and the balance of each nature magic is fully swayed. He marveled that this was an unparalleled magical piece of art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he suddenly woke up and shouted at the lizard: "It’s too fast to fly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The head of the corpse dragon has turned over. After being bombarded by hundreds of magicians a few days ago, it has become very sensitive to human breath. It can be inhaled, even if the lizard driver who is completely unenchanted can feel the madness of magical power and cause the strange fluctuations of the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a loud bang, the head and neck of the corpse dragon swayed slightly. This strong explosion left a small pit on its head. But this kind of damage obviously has no effect on it. It starts to open the green flame and will immediately spit out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru bent over and screamed through the clouds and screamed. The strength of his feet when he pulled out made the huge body of the Wyvern also sink. The white light wrapped around his body made him look like a silent lightning bolt to the head of the corpse dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front end of this lightning hit the head of the corpse dragon. The fists in the moment of contact with the corpse burst into dazzling light and loud noises. This is just a blow but completely better than the splendid roar of hundreds of magic. The head and neck of the corpse dragon squatted to the side under the force of this slamming, and even its huge body was also driven to the side by the impact. If you don't hit the head, there is no neck item as a buffer. This punch can completely knock down this mountain-like monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece of sky seems to suddenly start the rain of dead bodies. The head of the corpse dragon was almost completely broken, leaving only half of the mouth hanging on the neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three magicians who saw this all in the distance were completely shocked by this shocking power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the ultimate magicians who can see that it is not magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need for skill and wisdom, no conversion resonance, and so on. The art of deep casting is completely the most direct and vitality of the vitality. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how anyone sees this kind of power, this kind of temperament will only remember one word. power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three of them have all been obsessed with how to make themselves stronger, so they can become top magicians. But now when they see this real power, they are completely shocked. It is like the shock of the writers who have mastered the beauty and refined skills and art, but they have seen the beautiful scenery of nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this spectacular scene only paused for a moment. The green flame still rushed from the half to the side of the dragon. It is not the destruction of a small part of the real creature and does not hinder the flow of magical power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head and neck of the corpse dragon also immediately swayed back to the crazy green fire and sprinkled away in the middle of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru’s posture still keeps the punch. This punch is already his full strength. His body has not recovered from this explosive power and his body is completely empty. Facing the surging green giant waves, his solitary body is as small as a blade in the air, as if it will be immediately submerged in this dead ocean, and even a ripple can not be left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his body suddenly moved backwards out of thin air as if there was a giant hand pulling him like he just escaped the green fire. This is the effect of the wind system spells of Cedros. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wings of the two-legged dragons swelled upwards, but the wind that was fanned also brought up a few green fires to burn the wings of the dragon. Although it is only a few small green fires, it is enough to make the two-legged dragons struggle with the same fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sedros still controls the wind system with one hand and pulls Gru to the other hand and swings a few white Hans I lived in those green fires. The green fire and the cold mans smacked each other and smouldered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru stood on the back of the Wyvern. The two-legged dragon vacated and took off the scope of the corpse dragon flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpse dragon seems to be irritated by this attack, and the action is also swiftly moving toward the sky, shaking his body and jumping, but not jumping high and immediately His weight pulled back a huge floor sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body that can see the corpse dragon in the sky has begun to change. The bodies that formed the body began to squirm and then gradually the original broken head was added by the corpse that had creeped from elsewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good guy." Gru double eyes. Just now, the full blow did not knock this monster down to make him excited. "Fly and let me try again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
