			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When watching Xiao Xiao was taken out of the dungeon by the swordsmen. When the man was left alone, the eyes of Clavis suddenly became wet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is weakness. Absolutely a symbol of weakness. If it was before, Kravis would be angry with this reaction. In his mind, he has always been the strongest, most perfect, and the most successful incarnation. Like the mythical god standing in the middle of the world, the gods like the hyena are so majestic. No matter what it is to enjoy the warmth of the smile, tears in his view are all signs of weakness in the waste. He not only refuses these extreme dislikes, just like the beautiful poet can't stand the rotting corpse and the locusts that tumbling on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now he feels indifferent and even feels a little happy. It is his first cry to remove this madness on the fringe of jail, which is not at least normal in his own memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a month ago, the disciple of the famous Paladin of the famous Paladin, the disciple of the First Swordsman, was the most powerful Duke of Mulak in the First Cavalier Empire. The deputy can even be said to be the heir. But suddenly nothing is wrong. Even worse than those of the lowest-ranking people, he is just a prisoner, not even an individual, just a prop that is used to marry someone else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the glory of the fame and power of the cloud to the hell and was kicked down by the Duke of his own self-deprecating. He completely collapsed and almost mad. But here he only faced cold walls and steel fences and a little cock that simply used him as a madman. No one would pay attention to him. So after countless times of futile sorrow and painful madness, he finally accepted the reality and was awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite woman, who is nominally his wife, is also held hostage here but is so calm and calm. Prepare as carefully as going to a rare celebration. This is why he has always been so disgusted with her: in the real strength of her, she is just a coward who wraps up with arrogance. In fact, she has always been envious of her and she likes her but she is afraid to be self-contained in front of her and afraid that she is worthless. So she hated her so much to avoid her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her calm look seems to be a bit of anticipation to go to the firearms. He didn't believe that there was an idiot that knew that he had to come, but he knew that the Duke never did anything unsure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After she left for a long time, finally came a commotion from the top of the dungeon. From the screams and running of the soldiers, Clause can judge that the idiot that came to death is still coming. Is it to die for feelings? Really hopeless idiot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commotion did not last long. In a short while, the excited conversation of the soldiers of the Guards was passed down from the vent. It is said that the evil spirits of the all-night sinister magic are how the sinister Duke is how the wise gods fly and the two men who will escape will squat. Now the wanted criminal has been taken to the ducal office and personally interrogated by the Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis knows what the Duke’s interrogation means, but just squeezes out all the remaining use value of this dying person. For what shit love to steal the law, although thousands of people are also great? Is it very strong? In the end, it’s not only the Duke’s adult who grabbed the last useful thing and then disposed of it like garbage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garbage. Clavis smiled a bit. He feels a little envious of his heart now. The fools can take the initiative to die before they die. They can also show their strength to their stupidity before thousands of people. But now I only die in this dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of an unpleasant metal friction suddenly echoed in the dungeon. The door to the dungeon opened. Then there was another sound that was equally unpleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis is a little unexpected that the Duke should now have no time to pay attention to himself. However, he is now a special offender with no special status except the Duke’s personal order. There are only three people listening to the footsteps. Unconsciously, the conversations of the soldiers outside were completely quiet. Only these three footsteps echoed in the dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps of the three people rang in front of Clovis’s cell, which can be seen by the dim light. These are two pastors dressed in white robes and one near The head of the Wei army. When they came in, they closed the door and obviously didn't want to take people out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." A pastor chuckled. His relaxed tone is a bit inconsistent with this ruthless jail and the tasks he has performed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis smiled a bit and the Duke was too lazy to do it himself. He asked: "Can I ask the last question?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can ask as much as you can." The pastor showed a smile that didn't smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is my father?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This question is still asking yourself. The priest is still the weird expression that looks like a deliberately made face in the fire. He took out a reel and threw it to Clavis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis stunned if he threw in a magic that smashed him or a bottle of poison, he was mentally prepared but It is a magic scroll. He picked up the reel and identified it from the slight magical fluctuations above. This is a transfer reel. The style of the reel is also quite beautifully engraved with two small tiny flashes and unique magical fluctuations. Clovis frowned and asked: "Is this a transfer reel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Is it first to let him transfer to a place and then secretly kill it? Or this is simply a poor quality reel that sends people to an inexplicable place to die... but this is more boring than taking off the pants and farting is definitely not done by the Duke. Clavis struggled to guess but still didn't understand what he asked: "This is the reel where is it sent to?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course it is Descartes." The pastor replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 笛雅谷..." Klauvis muttered and then he immediately jumped reflectively and the voice was a little trembled. "You are the people of the Necromancer?" Although it is not too scary for him to reach the present stage. But the shock of the words 'Faya Valley' is far more than just ‘death’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go ahead. Your father should be there waiting for you. He asked us to save you." Another pastor replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My father asked you to save me? He is waiting for me in Deya Valley?" Crowes repeated this as hard as a child who just learned to talk. Two phrases are meant to clarify the meaning behind it. What tricks do you deceive? But what do you do to lie to yourself who will die? Is it true? But what is the relationship between the father... and the Necromancer? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right. Change your clothes and this person." The necromancer dressed by the priest went to the mouth of the cage and whispered a few times. The sentence words reached out and clicked on the big lock of the steel. After a strange sizzle, he reached out and twisted the lock and opened it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty is a special ogre made to prevent the most dangerous prisoners. It is impossible to twist it by force. The outer scent of the special scent lock with a slight melt of metal in the air is not damaged, but the inside must have been a mess. Being able to control magic in such a small range produces such a large effect. The first-class magician in the Magic Academy is a country-like squad compared to the magic level represented by this trick-like effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man dressed up by the Guard entered the cell. Klauvis is now a man with a stagnation between the movements and the movement is also very stiff as if it were a huge puppet. At the command of the Necromancer, Clause exchanged his clothes with this person. When he was doing this, his usual flexible and clear mind felt that he had been mixed and stabbed. He even wondered if he was dreaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was no longer surprised by what kind of news I had heard and what kind of changes I had. But in the desperate situation of self-confidence, there is no one to save someone. But it is not the angel who comes to save himself but the legendary hell messenger. It was the father who let them come... All of this has been more of his original understanding, as if he suddenly jumped into a sloppy story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clothing has just been changed. A Necromancer made a gesture. The guard, who was wearing Clovis's clothes, suddenly bent down and lowered his head. He used a motion that mimicked a cow and rushed toward the rock wall of the cell. Then his head was like The eggs are broken like the same. A little brain and blood splashed on the face of Clovis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are going. Isn't there enough here?" The Necromancer urged Clause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to admit that the mind of Ham's kid is very good. It seems that everything is in his expectation. This time to save this kid can really leave a lot of effort." The Necromancer watched Claves leave The empty cell whispered. "We can also wait for the good news in this place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Occasional guest thieves’ tricks are also very interesting, just that this thing is wearing more The skin is not good or the silver mask is much more comfortable and elegant." Another Necromancer reached out and pulled a mask on his face to reveal the elegant and dignified face. It is Bishop Adela. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Necromancer has also pulled down the mask. This is a middle-aged man who is well-maintained in white. He sighed with his white and delicate hands and sighed his face and said, "It's still very interesting. I haven't been so nervous for a long time. It reminds me of the taste of adventure many years ago. This time inham. I really said that there are really a lot of surprises when it comes to the strategy adventure before the change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are really a lot of surprises." Lord Della smiled and nodded. "The first thing I saw was our unruly former agent, Mr. Sandro, the old ambassador. Because Hamm said well, if he didn't die, he would definitely be back at the scene. And the best way to disguise is to dress up as a The priest. Although there is a mask, the magic is never deceiving. The only priest in the entire square is not using white magic but the detoxification effect is the best. Hehe."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The biggest surprise is waiting for the kid." The middle-aged man smiled and nodded. "Becaham is right. He really came. Have you seen it? The kid is using Sandro's living corpse. It works quite well."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a pity that the corpse is not used properly. I can feel that the toxin in the corpse seems to have caused a lot of magical power?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh yeah. But the toxin is simply too artistic, and it takes so much magic. It’s like a poor chef who spent a lot of effort and countless precious materials but only pieced together The pot was big and not smashed. Most of the people were not poisoned. No one in the guild would come to the whole square to live." The middle-aged man shook his head and sighed. "This kid seems to be only good at living corpses. It may be because of the leaves of the world tree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this kid’s mind is still very good. It’s almost really let him save people. It’s a pity that it’s a loss.” Adela frowned and filled with regret and sighed as if he had failed. "Unfortunately..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. Unfortunately..." The middle-aged man also sighed. "If they insisted on it at the time, it would be fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know? If it weren’t for the respect of the respected Sandru, I would have a lightning bolt to put that The inconvenient Duke became a roast pig."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, then the two people can leave the kingdom smoothly...we don't need to wait here again." Followed by the killing of the killing, I will capture the whereabouts of our lovely world tree leaves. And I am really curious as to whether a two-legged dragon can deal with a few of our gargoyles?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure. There will be opportunities to experiment slowly in the future. Now we are here waiting for the news. Dear Sandru and the Paladin The head of the group is convinced that we will wait for the good news. Hehe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long before the door of the dungeon was opened again. A priest dressed up came in and closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I seem to smell the good news of the respected Mr. Nimbas." Adela smiled and said to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer, known as Nimbath, walked down a few steps and said with a smile: "There is good news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any bad news?" Adela stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will say good news about what is going on." Nimbas sighed. "The Duke took the boy to a separate interrogation and then I saw our former acting president, Sandru and the head of the Paladin, waiting at the gate of the Dukes to evacuate all the guards from the Dukes. I will I know that there will be a good show."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of good play?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it really is good news. If they chase it, they should talk about us." Adela took a clap. "Well, what are you waiting for here? Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you listen to my bad news?" Nimbas smiled and didn't move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What bad news?" Adela frowned with the middle-aged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The bad news is that we can only go back and can't chase the kid." Nimbas said weakly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" The two Necromancers are together. The three necromancers simultaneously shot to catch a person. This is not a knife to kill a chicken. It is simply insecticide. Since Sandro has been separated from the target, they can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man suddenly had a problem. After entering the dungeon, Nimbas stood on the steps and neither walked down nor went up. The middle-aged man asked: "Why are you standing there and not moving?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I don't dare to move." Nimbasi smiled and answered. "There is a plaque behind my neck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dark golden skull mask floated from the back of Nimbas. It must be done with great effort to see that this is actually a figure that blends with the darkness of the surrounding dungeons. In the hand of a figure, a black cockroach was placed on the neck of Nimbas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the surprise, the middle-aged man immediately bowed his head and made a ceremonial voice full of surprises and a little excitement. "I can't think of seeing you here, respecting the beautiful Ai Greinel. Your style and skill are still so beautiful and the same as when I first saw you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh. You seem to be the same as Nobinonot. Still can say that." The dark golden mask nodded. I drifted down a few steps and left Nimbas. Nimba sighed and licked his neck but still didn't move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what you are doing here?" The middle-aged man asked very respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that Sandru died and I came to see it. As a result, I accidentally encountered a scouting owl. I just searched the magical breath and searched. I really found him out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the respected Mr. Sandru is still so energetic. We see him as if he has added magic. You can go and investigate the college...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw him." Dark Gold nodded. "But you and I listened to Nimbas. Did you come to three people specifically to catch the kid? When is the noble Necronomics Guild like the thieves and the thieves who like to win."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哎This is also a no-brainer. This kid knows the whereabouts of the leaves of the world tree. You also know that we are determined to be worthy of this thing..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then? I heard that you are planning to kill him. Because he is the reason that Akibad called the people who gathered power. You forgot about Akibad. Have you made the rules?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Middle-aged Nopolinot wiped the sweat and looked at the standing Ni Mbas. Nimbas made a gesture of helplessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you also shut the Vaderina's hoe. Although I have never liked her, she is a member of the guild. You are actually In the sacred Descartes Valley, the infighting. "The sound of the dark gold squatting is not high, but it is cold and immersed in the human bone marrow. "The noble sorcerer's guild in your hands has become a dirty and arrogant place for thieves' courts. This kind of person does not deserve to stay in the whistle valley."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adela, who has never spoken before, said: "This is the decision of all guild members to discuss together. Dear former acting president." His voice is very soft and the words are very short. But it is just right to express the meaning of the expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the dark gold flashed toward Adela's face. Adela is still a dignified smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half a mile, the light under the mask turned back to dim and then sighed. "Yeah. I am not a guild. I don't seem to be able to control your affairs." Nopolino and Nimbas just sighed and said, "I don't care, but today you guys." I must go back to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take out your delivery reels and pull them apart." The sound is not big, but the faint majesty and momentum are not to be ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adela smiles even brighter and seems to be a little embarrassed to say: "Mr. Ai Rui Ruier, although you are our former acting president But you can't..." Just as he smiled the most brilliant and gentle, his hand suddenly slammed into a white light and filled the entire cell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Paralysis’. The most effective offensive auxiliary magic in white magic. Although it can not cause direct damage, it can make the vitality of the body completely turbulent under the influence of white magic, causing the opponent to move. In the hands of the magician of Adela's level, as long as the opponent is still a flesh-and-blood body, even a behemoth may have to be stiff for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after using this magic, it is not the figure wearing the dark gold mask but Adra himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black shackles were placed on Adra’s neck and the two spikes that stretched out like the devil’s claws. Adela can feel the hair around the neck is falling like the leaves in the ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The greatest advantage of young people is that they are always full of fighting spirit and ambition to dare to challenge the authority to despise authority. This is the reason for progress." Floating behind Adela. There are no signs of wind and movement at all, as if it were there. "But the biggest drawback is that I don't know how high the earth is. It's a reason to die easily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey. Please let us know that we have three people." The smile disappeared. The light of white magic on his body is shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can see that your white magic is very good at your age." The sound of the dark gold under the head is not too slow. . "But as long as it is tied up by Nick, I promise that even if the pastor of the entire Magic Academy comes together, I will only watch you become a mummy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You are merciless. Young people are really not very sensible..." Nopolino and Nimbas did not have a little help to show signs. They are not young people and they are impulsive and they are also very clear about what kind of situation people are. Even though the three magicians can annihilate the entire army of the kings, in such a room, almost one rabbit is almost equal to one of the top killers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am also a member of the guild. Do you want to kill me?" Adela didn't smile but was not nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you just used the attack magic, you are already a corpse. I haven’t killed anyone for many years. I hope you don’t force me today." The command that left Adra’s neck sound was even heavier. "I will take your transfer reel and pull it out again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nopolinot sighed and walked back to the cell of Clauses. Before looking at the mouth, I read a few spells in my mouth and several magics were hit on the three sides of the stone wall. There was a loud noise from ‘bang’. The boulder that was collapsed in the cell filled the corpse inside and was also pressed underneath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noise of the soldiers sounded outside. The soldiers who were hypnotized into their dreams woke up and were rushing here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nopolino and Nimbas took out the delivery reel and opened Adela hesitated and had to come out with two companions. Transfer the reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the door was opened, the soldiers who rushed in saw only the empty dungeon and the cell that collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headquarters of the Paladin. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of Roland was just about to send someone to the prison to release the Clause when he was released. The dungeon was collapsed because of the water seepage for a long time. The news that the prisoner inside was crushed to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of Roland was furious. He knew that there should be a lot of secrets of the Duke on his disciple. He had been waiting to solve the Duke and went to ask him to ask. But in this way, many things that are unknown are always in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a heartache in the wrath. That is the disciple he has cultivated for many years. But since the matter has already been born, it is no longer a problem. And now it will be the most busy period of all energy to stay in this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
