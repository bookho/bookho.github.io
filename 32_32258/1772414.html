			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tens of thousands of troops with Elazia have almost completely annihilated these thousands of one-hundred warriors who have all gone into the rush of these more than 20 miles. A vague piece of flesh and blood was scattered, but at this time the degree of advancement of the coalition did not slow down but suddenly increased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this time the charge is no longer a human warrior but an Orford orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you walked along with the horses, there wasn’t an orc who had the slightest tiredness. On the contrary, the warfare that was violently provoked by the surrounding battles and bloody blasts came out at this time. In the hands of the orcs, it’s not the warrior’s sword and gun contradictory cards, but the chain, the meteor hammer, the hammer, the hammer, the axe, the heavy-duty weapons, and all of them are larger than the one used by humans. Guy. There are no slightly thin races of lizards and half-orcs, all of which are the strongest werewolf ogres and some of the minotaurs that have just returned from Nigan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests in the team and the orc shaman simultaneously activated the auxiliary spells. White white magic light also has a unique blush of orc bloodthirsty. These beasts roared and swayed with the giant weapons in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is a strong skeleton or a skeleton. Even those skeleton monsters that are nearly ten meters high are cut down under the charge of the orcs, and they are madly broken into pieces by a madman. Other zombies are more fragile as cinders that have dried up. Under the touch, it will be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only a few corpse witches who have the ability to fight back and continue to have magic flying from all sides to the orcs and exploding a canopy element sparks: there is a flame There are lightning and ice fragments that are flying like rain. The orcs never shunned the magic with the help of the priests and the huge body to smash the magic together with all the bones in front of them. The degree of the roaring screaming and screaming of the orcs in the orcs has risen again. The waves of the undead wreckage that was knocked out in front were bigger and more brilliant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the momentum was pushed forward for a few miles, the darkness in the air became more and more intense. In the depths of this undead sea. The undead is no longer as good as the periphery. The puppets are not only more flexible but more solid and seem to have some degree of thinking. Numerous corpse witches began to gather in all directions and the magical waves that flew here suddenly became more and more. The fireball lightning flashed down the head of the beast in front of the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty air elements have finally risen from the coalition forces carrying dozens of divisions. As they rise, a dazzling magical shock wave is launched from their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are different magics from the sorcerers. Only a few dozens of magic can only be tens of thousands, but these dozens are not the sorcerers. The low-level magic of lightning, lightning, and fireballs is dozens of fiery bombs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty small suns are equally dazzling, and the ball is shot in all directions in all directions. At this moment, even the boundless darkness is torn apart, even the smell of the dark star can not cover the heat of these dozens of top fire magic. This piece of dragon desert instantly returns from the polar ice to the heat of roasting eggs. Then the next moment became a hot hell. Not only in the vicinity of the fire, but also in the vicinity of the ash, everything in the vicinity of the fly ash is cracked and deformed at this high temperature. The destructive power created by these dozens of top-level spells has been almost the same as the curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been until the inside. The fiery bombs gradually dissipated and were swallowed up by the darkness of the air, but there was nothing in the radius around the army. The foot is no longer a desert but a glass-like crystal. The coalition's silk is not damaged. At the same time that these fire masters are magical, a huge water curtain appears on the outskirts of the coalition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adelaide around Lancelot is pale and her master's water curtain is the top protection spell. But even if it is only a short moment and the strength is not high, the area is too big and almost has reached the limit of manpower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not stop but turned directly to a qi element. The gas element lifted up and she flew forward alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is now that there is no need to retain any troops to make a sudden advance." With the orders of Lancelot and Roland, the Paladins who have kept the strength behind are also The army and the already exhausted orc army are one. This was burned out by the fire of the fire, but the time of several breaths has been filled with the undead in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
