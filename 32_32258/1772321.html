			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every complete release of the light and fire system of the combined curse must have considerable magical power to support, Sylvia can not and magic Compared with a full-time Master, swordsmanship is also weak and several other Knights of the Temple, but in general it is the most suitable candidate for the Knights of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the end, it’s only a line, only one difference can be completed, but it’s just that the line seems to be never finished. He really didn't think that the perception of the demon leader could be as high as this. The invisibility of all evil eyes and other eye demons was seen, and once he was discovered, he could never find it again. Go to any gap where you can use the reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; madly slashing the eagle around the eagle, Sylvia madly praying in prayer, showing a miracle to the Lord of heaven Can give him a chance to use the scroll. Although he has been praying for more than 30 years, he has never seen the miracle of the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time he seems to have finally seen it. When the brilliance of the eagle is ignited in the screams, it is almost really thought that the Lord of heaven is showing miracles to destroy evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brilliance of the brilliance illuminates the entire huge cave, like a small sun-like light ball that emits amazing heat and light from the sky, slanting The eagle banshee cluster fell on the ground, and the rocky ground was melted out of a large pool of red magma. Whether it is the eagle or the evil eye that floats, all objects close to this light ball are melted at high temperatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roller’s madness screams, his eyes are almost red, and this enchanting is at least half the eagle Coke was made, and other plumages that burned even if they were not directly burned, and the screams of hundreds of people made his heart twist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eye sorcerer also made a strange scream, not only the eagle owl, but also the evil eyes of dozens of eyes and eyes floating in the air. The power of the light ball is burned to ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of them and the high priest of Tima immediately looked at the top of the tall cave. The ball of light fell from the top and they all looked It is of course not a miracle to draw this, this is the top spell of the fire magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the cave in this huge space is nearly a thousand meters from the bottom. Just now the Thamma priest used this terrain to use magic like a meteor fire. Now when they looked up, they saw that the top of the fire had just fallen and began to snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless snowflakes that are condensed in the air by water, and then wrap around each other and get colder and colder. It should have been impossible to have any strong air convection in the cave space and suddenly there was a strong wind that swirled out of the air, threatening the cold current wrapped in these snowflakes. Other eagle owls and evil eyes that remained in the air were immediately blown in this strangely huge snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A blizzard? Is it a magician? Is there a hole in the top of the top?" The sudden snowstorm made the sight of the Tema High Priest obstructed, but it was not clear, but He immediately judged what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Master can release a blizzard and immediately come to a blizzard. These two are the top magic of the water system and the fire system. It is undoubted that this is used. Magic scroll. Now the blizzard, which almost completely covers the battlefield, is obviously not simply cast out, but is controlled by the water magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top layer has just experienced a meteor shower. Needless to say, the accomplices of the Knights of the Temple, even flies can not lurk on it. The only possibility is that the top of the cave space is another cave. It is not uncommon for such caves to overlap each other in the terrain, but at this time, this point is only seen, and it is very fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to think about how the knights will know the terrain that they don’t even know, and set up the ground there. The most important thing is still the Knight of the Temple and the scroll in his hand. In any case, the scroll can not be cast out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't let him use the scroll." The priest of Tima screamed, and the huge figure slammed into the direction of the Knights of the Temple. Nothing is slower than the banshee. The basil and the eye sorcerer immediately followed up<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, there was a blizzard, which made Sylvia, which was already desperate, almost really thought it was a miraculous exhibition. But now is not to go deep into the question of how this miracle is going on, the interference around it is gone, and the tide-like Tauren warrior is still some distance from here. This is really a great opportunity for him to display. He shakes his hand and pulls out the reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sylvia, come up quickly." A voice from above gave him a motion, and he looked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blizzard of the sky, a group of water curtains is like a huge blue gem, wrapped in a cloud-like element. The giant is above. fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talis Knight?" Sylvia was about to open the reel's hand and hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, the smelting of Ditian Paradise only burns her together. Above is a blonde female swordsman. It was at this time that the ground was violently undulating. Sylvia jumped up. More than a dozen large-scale stalagmites, like sharp weapons, are pierced from the ground in the sound of the boom, criss-crossing in the original position of Sylvia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvia leaps high, the giant element of the gas has flew away from his side, and Talis on the gas element reaches out and puts He pulled into the water and dropped it on the gas element. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talis Knight, how are you here?" Sylvia looked at the horsewoman with surprise and joy. He couldn't figure out how the savior, such as the miracle, would be the Lancelot disciple who should travel to study. Nigan underground would never be a place to travel casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis’s look was a little weird for a moment, no direct answer, just the manipulation of the rising element of gas, said: "Now is not the time to say this, Leave and say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sylvia didn't have the extra worries to care about this, his hand re-takes the curse. His current magical power is just enough to completely release this magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All retreat, leave here..." The roar of Tima's high priest was passed to the ears of every tauren. Whether it is the Tauren who are scattered on the battlefield or are coming in this direction, they will go to the various passages. They have long understood what is going to happen in the roar of the high priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black Elf and the Ginger Dusha were originally in retreat, and Osero’s passage to the outside was wide and could not be so in a short time. Many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mutual killing on the battlefield has evolved into a murderous battle for the passage. Numerous crowded underground creatures slash, bite, and trample. The soldiers are retreating, but the three tribal leaders are not. Although they can see the elements of the air and the Knights of the Temple in the air, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feeling the magical power that is about to rush, but they still have not given up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the eye-devil leader is the most embarrassing, but the first to do it is him. A circle of halo swung aside his huge eyeball, and then he made a light that was several times larger than the one just smashed out of the eyeball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of eye-rays emit light almost from the line of sight, without giving time to dodge. But the light didn't hit the gas element or the knight's knight. The huge circular water curtain around the gas element, although it looks like a layer of a thin book, completely resists the foot.<br /> Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rays that can melt the rocks. The slamming sound of the water, the light from the water curtain and the eye magic dissipated at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eye sorcerer made a screaming hoarse scream, his huge eye seemed to be overpowered and the pupil was covered with bloodshot, which is already his full blow. . Other evil eyes floating in the air were blown up by the blizzard that was picked up. Needless to say, it was impossible to fix the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tima priest rushed the fastest, the body of the huge Tauren could not have the agility of the Black Elves, he used to fly fast The speed mourns a small magical spell, and the sharp stalagmites that have just highlighted the ground suddenly slammed off the ground and shot like a smashing arrow into the air element of the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sylvia, who just fell into the air, looked at these flying stalagmites and held the sword in both hands, and the shining armor on his body lit up the glory of the heavens. Eyes shine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
