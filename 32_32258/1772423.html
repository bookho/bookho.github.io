			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard!" Moriel and the roaring sound of her body shape suddenly pulled up but not rushed to Asa but greeted the fly The black star sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an endless darkness behind the blade. Wherever it flies, whether it is heaven or earth, everything is drowned by this darkness. It seems that the light and everything in this world are just A layer of hypocritical epiphany illusion, this dark lightning tears this superficial camouflage to restore the world to nothing black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slap of blood that was originally flowing like a creek is sprayed from the wound of Moriel like a waterfall and this blue blood falls together There are countless magical energies and blood mixed together in front of the body to become a huge ball of destruction. She and the ball of destruction are in front of the black star sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black lightning that smashed the world suddenly stopped when the tip of the sword was inserted into the ball of destruction with countless blue blood, and it was still not together. Moriel tore apart together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey now kills the kid." Moriel's roar is no longer as deafening but can't conceal the dry exhaustion. The blue blood has not flowed out too much, but it has already stopped bleeding but it has almost flowed away. The crystal body has lost its dazzling blue color and the white crystals falling down are not the original skin of the black dragon but the bones. This is the real limit. She has used her vitality to resist this sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is too damaged. The space magic that moves in the moment is no longer possible. Asa is too far away from her. The only thing she can do to deal with Asa is to temporarily stop the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic power is running low. She almost used all the vitality of her own to use this devastating ball and only the pure chaotic magic energy in the ball of destruction. Resist the black star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword does not stop completely but slowly and very hard to move forward in this chaotic energy. Moriel can feel the chaotic energy in the ball of destruction and his vitality together in the darkness of the air, she wants to turn around and look at the situation behind her, then screaming and urging, but unfortunately she has already had this little strength. Can't use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not practical for her to urge everyone to fly towards Asa for whatever purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps are still so empty and step by step, the expression of the eyes is still empty, but the king of the Necromancer has no more than just scorning the world, at least he It looks like a wolf and a wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ghost of the Ghost King has completely disappeared from the original chaotic energy of the ball of destruction, and it is not even the treasure of this kind. Leave a trace. And Asa himself said that he had been like a broken ceramic doll before. Then he is now a broken doll, and the crack in his body has doubled and doubled. It seems that it is only by strength to maintain it physically intact or it can break into pieces at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these are not the most important and most important thing is the hilt of the dark star that holds the hilt in his hand. The above is no longer a black mist that looks like a thick fog, and a piece of ordinary obsidian has no two cobweb-like cracks covered with hilts. The original emptiness makes people feel uncomfortable. Almost no more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hilt has been hurt and has been hurt! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This injury is very heavy and seems to be just a step away from the break. And as long as any one of them is really broken, it will be all over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland de Lanslot’s eyes burst into breathtaking light as if the people who had been rushing for a night in the dark endless abyss finally saw it. sunlight. Roland is the closest person to Asa. Although there was no weapon in the broken arm, there was always a bloody immersion, but he did not hesitate to fit in and rushed toward Asa. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And refers to such as Feng, such as Jianfeng Jianqi Jianyi perfused in the only left hand on the left. This kind of hit with a hand-made sword is naturally impossible to compare with the previous sword. However, the idea of ​​winning in this sword is only stronger than the sword of his full strength. The sword is sharper and sharper. Faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the snoring, Roland's mouth spit blood and flew out more than ten meters. But after landing, the light in his eyes did not weaken, but it was even brighter and hotter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a vain-like dodge and offense that can be followed by his almost complete attack on the tip of the sword is completely ineffective and repelled. Still the steep cavity caused the surrounding body to break automatically but he only broke four ribs and only broke four ribs. The knife of the king of the dead can only break his four ribs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he felt very clear that when the palm of his hand brushed his chest, there was a feeling of rupture. The one did not completely escape. Now he can see the chest of Asa. There was a lot of cracks in the work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no longer the horrible invincible king of the dead, he can be sure. His Lancelot and Gru three people will be able to crush him or not even use three people. Gru's original location was a little farther from here near Morial and Lancelot was already sprinting white and the sword light was already out of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is also convinced that his empty scorpion can clearly see that all the factors of all things are reflected in the unconscious and empty consciousness. It is all the trajectories of this world. Because nothing is empty, everything can be achieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even now that this ability has been weakened with the body and the black star's hilt, he can still make it clear: only a little five and seven seconds time. The combination of Lancelot and Roland will be on the way. This is the third time the coordination and synchronization between the two men's joints is controlled in at least seven thousandths of a second. With the power of the now-crushed hilt, they can only be cracked and they can't resolve their offense. Even if they take the most efficient dodge, they will be cut down by half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dark Star Blade in midair has almost smashed a ruined ball in the murderous ball of Moriel and swayed the top magic with Moriel. And the most powerful creatures under the Dark Stars seem to be so small that they will immediately be shredded and destroyed into the darkness behind. But Asa knows that it is not immediate but it still takes 3,031 seconds and then the sword can break the ball of destruction and Moriel flies to join the hilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he has not resisted the ability to dodge after being hit by Lancelot and Roland. The remaining seven or four seconds is enough for two people to take him. Mince twenty times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although knowing that this would be the result of Asa’s expression, the mood is not the slightest fluctuation is still an endless empty void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn’t matter that he’s emptied in the sense of emptiness. There’s already no success. The concept of success and failure is no worries, no worries, no harm, only the one uploaded from the Dark Star. The idea made him move forward. As a precision machine that has set the destination. Regardless of the outcome, he will go on and go...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His vision and attention sweeping over Grutha is farthest from here and still needs three points Five seconds to get there. I can ignore and then there are two people in the same direction as Lancelot who need two seconds. These are two very weak people. Two women are two people who know Talis and Xiao Yan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are two? Suddenly, the emptiness of consciousness seems to have something agitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he had noticed the two people before, but it was reflected in his vast emptiness. It was just two insignificant factors. Ignore it. But now I can see that the emptiness consciousness that has become a lot smaller can no longer reflect them as simple factors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This instigation together can’t stop more than just about them and there’s more to go out of somewhere in consciousness. It seems that there is always something hidden behind this piece of endless emptiness. Now, one of the lines of thought has touched one of the most sensitive points. All of them are stimulated. The consciousness of bulging after the stupidity is empty can not skip to ignore them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although their pace is very slow compared to Lancelot, they are still weak, but they are still dying to run here. The bloody face is full of tears. . Asa saw very clearly the scars on them. He saw that it was the result of countless desperate fights. At least ten of them were almost worse and they were killed. They shouldn’t have appeared here. He remembers...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the surging of memory and information, the surge behind it is getting stronger and more unstoppable, but he can’t stop thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the emptiness of his consciousness, there was a rupture of sound. The agitation behind this actually opened up a gap in this emptiness. It’s just a gap, but it’s such a powerful thing that rushes out of this gap directly across the void consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You two don't come over." Asa spoke to both of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who heard this sound are stunned. This is no longer the sound of a completely empty hole. The smell of anxiety and fear is entangled in the original empty voice. This should not be The tone of the king of the dead spirit should not be the words that the king of the dead spirit, which is not parallel to the world, can be shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis and Xiaoxie were first horrified and then turned into ecstasy. They were already running hard and they ran much faster. Talis had screamed at Lancelot, who had begun to sword: "The teacher woke up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Lancelot has just condensed the light The cross not only did not dissipate slowly. On the contrary, it is even more fierce and more desperate. Roland is also the case. This is the third and perhaps the last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They of course heard the strangeness of Asa’s words and the call of Talis, they all heard it, but for them it’s not a recovery. Asa’s chance is even more an opportunity to kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no difference in thinking between women who care about chaos. The judgment of both of them is absolutely the most efficient and most decisive. If Asa really woke up, the first thing he had to do was not to yell but to put down the black-handed hilt in his hand. And what they hear from Asana's voice is not pure emotion, but more chaos. This should be due to the loss of control caused by constant blows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky behind Moriel’s temperament is getting weaker and weaker. They have no risk to try to see if there is a chance to let Asa wake up. Even if it is There are ninety-nine percent chances that they can't try it now. This can only be seen as the best chance to destroy him and destroy the Dark Star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swords are far less powerful than before but are enough for the current King of the Dead. They can see that Asa’s body has begun to rush out of the red blood. It seems that he has begun to collapse in self without their attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't come over." Asa still recited this sentence. The emptiness in the voice is not the confusion that is gathered together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emptiness of consciousness has broken through his body and seems to have cracked. The crack that spread all over the body didn't feel the slightest feeling that he could now feel the pain. This kind of pain that spreads all over the body seems to have a long-lost feeling of heart and soul. Together with this feeling, the breath from the hilt of the left hand should have been integrated with his life and consciousness, regardless of the breath that should not be felt by each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can feel that the instructions have been separated from each other and echoed with the illusion of rupture in his consciousness, trying to revert to that piece and his life. The integration of nothingness and silence. But the darkness of the darkness does not allow a trace of cracks to desperately rush to the outside to fill this void. The two opposite forces are pulling each other desperately, but they all want to unify the body of this consciousness, but let Asa’s consciousness and body begin to break apart at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lanslot and Roland joined the final blow. Asa no longer has the chance to hit the dodge that the emptiness of the sea that could reflect anything that has been reflected has been pulled apart by the power of numerous cracks in the crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsmanship of the two men condensed on one point, such as a needle, although it can not be earth-shattering, but can open up the earth. It’s not the black star of Asa’s hand that is Asa’s chest. Although neither of them is moving because they are still not sure to crush the black star, even if it’s already broken, at least not 100% sure, it’s 100%. Grasp the crush of Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop." Three voices sounded at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop and so on." The great snoring came from Grutha, who had turned into a shadow and flew here, but it was too late for him to be too far from here. Not light. His snoring undoubtedly shocked anyone's spirit but it has become a needle for the current Lancelot and Roland without their spiritual will and sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stop." Xiao Yan is also calling her voice is less likely to play any role. Gru's roar almost drowned her voice. At the same time, screaming Talis, she can see that this sword's combined attack can make Asa smash into the sky and the little cockroaches. The fear and strength from the deepest bottom of the heart makes the screams directly out of her throat. The thing is that she is not just shouting 'staying'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
