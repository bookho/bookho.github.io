			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis carefully walked behind the head of Roland and walked into the grove. The first-ever Wangdu Guards were ordered to stay outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improved how Modo’s idiot should be done, but I have never seen my men come back. Clovis immediately called the Wangdu Guards to search around but the results were completely unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already compiled a set of seamless and reasonable lost seals in the right place at the right time and in the right way. Cooperating with the spleen of the prime minister, no one knows the temper. Anyone who listens to such a story will naturally recall the bad behavior of the scorpion’s forged documents for stealing the seal for private enmity. It is really hard to blame for such an accident. Clause has already received the true biography of the Duke of Mulak in these small tricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in terms of spiritual accomplishment, he is obviously far behind. Since the establishment of the Paladin, almost the most inexplicable casualties have come out of their own hands. The key to their own team is that their greatest real purpose does not seem to succeed. His present expression is shocked and angry and shy and uneasy. Fortunately, the head of Roland did not notice the complex emotions of his disciples. He carefully examined all the traces on the ground and the bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paladin as the most powerful force of the Emperor’s team is very rare when it comes to play. But once they need it, they are the most important moments. Or the most arduous and difficult war. But even this less than a thousand troops have never had a major death or injury in the battle with tens of thousands of enemy and pagans. Someone once made a statistic. In the face of this elite army, the pagans and enemy forces sent out more than 1,100 heads in exchange for a heroic life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there are twelve bodies but there are no 10,000 enemies dead here and even the enemy seems to have lost a small piece of nails. The face of Colonel Roland is ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably because of the respect for the Paladins, the troops who arrived here first carefully removed the bodies of the swordsmen’s incomplete separation and put them together to cover the white cloth. . The head of Roland looked at these neat bodies and the footprints of the ground that were staggered and asked: "Where is the first unit here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Clauvis replied: "Wangdu is the fourth squad of the Guards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Withdrew the captain's position." The tone of the head of Roland No anger or dissatisfaction is calm and flat, as if you are just reading a paper. "There is such a big event that does not protect the scene and let the troops come in to destroy all the traces. Since he likes to express his respect so much, let him go to the palace gate every day."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis bowed and replied: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked at the body on the ground. "Why did the person who stole your forged stamps only transferred 12 people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because at the time there were only those people in my team at the headquarters, probably he also Don't dare to stay longer to call more people." Crowvis replied. However, the actual situation is of course inconvenient for his secret operations to involve too many people. Moreover, the swordsmen of the twelve Paladins and a magician are more than enough to kill a two-legged dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately." Roland’s head, the pair of very elegant eyes, flashed the eagle’s cold light and said coldly. "If he takes your people away, you don't need to be the captain any more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis had a cold sweat on his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked at the forest that had begun to thaw. Now all the frozen objects in the early summer are slowly beginning to thaw. The water vapor in the air is condensed and melted together to form a thin turbulent stream that flows out in this magical cold weather. Before the prestige of the ground, you can still feel the chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The opponent should be a very powerful magician." Roland's voice was colder than the wood in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorcerer?." Clavis doesn't believe that the guy should use some magic but it won't be evaluated by the first master of the empire. Awesome'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clovis also looked at the woods carefully and thought about it before he hesitated and shook his head and said, "It seems that... there is no magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a paladin The team's captain, the first swordsman of the empire, even if he does not use magic, but also knows the attacking ability and attack effect of each magic level in each system. The effect of any ice in the attack magic is only strong. The most important thing is the damage caused by ice. The wood in front of it is purely frozen without any trace of destruction. In his memory, it seems that there is really no magic that can cause such strange scenes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," said Roland’s head. "Desperate magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Desperate magic?" Clavis puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Without spellcasting skills or even using any spells, only one water magician can pour out one of his most powerful magical powers to cause such a Consequences.” Colonel Roland pointed to the body of the magician and asked Clavis. "Do you know how high the magic level of your man is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The senior water magic teacher who was once a magic school before being transferred to our team is Say... how should the empire be counted in the top 50."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of opponent can make the top 50 of an empire The division gave up using the spell and simply used all the magic power to make a desperate shot?" Colonel Roland looked at the body of the magician. The expression of the corpse's hand on the face of his face is still full of horror and panic. "It can only be a magician whose level difference is too big for him to have the confidence to attack even the attack. And in the end, this opponent does not have a hard touch with him for decades, but he does not know what to use. The method allowed him to hit himself. Although this opponent has an absolute advantage, he is not arrogant, but avoids the weight and uses the most efficient and tricky way...." Roland Group sighed long. His face is very angry, but now he shows a leopard-like look of hunting. "This is a real master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master. The word is completely more ‘very powerful’. A dragon or a behemoth can be very powerful but it will never be a 'master'. And this is the ‘master’ in the mouth of the first sword of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis knows that he’s not dead in this dozen or so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You said that the man was dispatched because he had to deal with a person?" Colonel Roland asked to ask Claus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is pure speculation." Clavis bowed his head. "The contradiction between the man and the cousin who stole my seal is unknown. My cousin was originally narrow-minded and arrogant. When he was last hunt, he used to take the Royal Guard to attack him, so I will Do this guess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of Roland looked at his apprentice coldly and said: "You are talking about the person who is the priest under Dr. Ronis. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Clovis's head did not dare to lift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s head’s eyes are not very sharp on his apprentice’s eyes, but Clauvis feels that he is also in the magician’s desperate life. The frozen ice used in the bones is cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of Roland finally sighed and said nothing. Compared with these things, it is more important to analyze the real situation of this somewhat strange battle. It is certain that this scene will at least not be the one that the priest can do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully observed the bodies of the swordsmen and noticed the most eccentric. The lower part of the waist is also frozen in a jumping position, but the head is gone. The muscles of the neck fracture are incomplete. The bones are separated from the joints. It seems that they are not cut by a sword but a left hand that has been screwed down. Although they are picked up by the guards of the Guards, they can still see that the same It is the section that is unscrewed. And the right hand is not at all half the length of the hand, and the bones that are twisted softly like a snake are undoubtedly all fragments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s eyebrows wrinkled. Even with his eyes, he couldn’t see how the swordsman was attacked. His eyes swept deeper and wrinkled from other bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are just twelve people here." Crowvis reminded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It shouldn’t be thirteen. And the body of your cousin’s prime minister. Since he thinks he can kill the other party, he must have arrived here since the opponent. It’s impossible to kill all of your twelve men and it’s impossible to let him go.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis looked at the surrounding woods with a close look The Guards have already checked this place carefully, and there will never be a corpse waiting for him to dig. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he took a few steps and suddenly appeared under a tree not far away. There is something that looks a bit familiar. A little bitch. He walked over and there were some teeth scattered on the ground, some broken nails, some clothes that were corroded into cloth and some small things. Because these seem to be just a bunch of garbage guards, they didn't care. Kravis stunned at the poor relics and turned to the head of Roland: "It seems to be here...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland Head Come over and look at your armpit and pick up a little bit of dirt on the ground and smell it on the nose. His brow stretched out but his face became as ugly as the mud. He stood up and silenced for a moment and then said to Clauses: "Go to Bishop Ronis, don't do this, don't work as a bishop, or go first to the Cosbert Grand Sergeant."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cusbert's great priest was soon led by Clauses. I looked at the mutated corpses and said, "This is a spell that manipulates the corpse in a mixture of dark magic and physical magic. In a short time, all the vitality and energy released from the corpse will be released in this short time. Combat power. This fusion spell is very difficult, even if the senior magician should go through a very complicated mantra to move." He paused the original face of the old man to sink more ugly. "The evil spirits that will study and use this evil spell must be the Necromancer. You dare to appear in the vicinity of the king. If they are met, they must be good-looking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, he does not know that people who use this spell will be yawning when they cast spells, otherwise his face must be more ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s head nodded and pointed at the head over there and said, “It’s the same as I judged. From the traces of the soil there, there is still a person who is greatly corroded. Sexual magic melts away even if the bones are not left. This is really the trick that the Necromancer can have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cusbert Great God Officer Turning his head and looking at the head of Roland, "The news of the Necromancer should first report to our School of Magic that it is the people of your Paladin who can act like this." His words are imposing because of this rash action. The complete disregard of the status of the School of Magic also made him lose the opportunity to let the Necromancers look good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Things are like this" Clausue said his own ‘guess’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is another guy!" After listening to Clause's words, the face of the great priest was as ugly as a rag in the toilet. "There are twelve places in the fight. There are some connections with the Necromancer." Probably it was a lot of anger and dissatisfaction that suddenly appeared on his face. He seems to have confirmed Asa’s Severe character is the ironclad proof of collusion with the Necromancer. He said to the head of Roland. "We went directly to the bishop to report the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis did not go back to the Duke’s House to tell the Duke the accident. He knew that he knew his own way even if he didn't say the Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke didn’t want to immediately laugh after listening to it: “Your seal is really appropriate. The arrangement is not bad.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry. This thing was done because of the temporary decision I didn't have time to inform you to make a claim." Croveys was a bit flustered. The tricks that can fool others are inferior to the children in the Duke's game and he does not dare to hide. "Because I think this thing is not harmful to us. If we kill him, we have eliminated a hidden danger. The position of my uncle's prime minister is absolutely unstoppable. And even if it fails like this, we are completely out of touch." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." The Duke raised his hand to indicate that his son-in-law did not have to panic. "You remember what I said, and you should do it. I’m still a little bit motivated, but it’s really good. In the current situation, the more contradictions, the more chaotic the situation is. The more organic people are, the better they can be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This comment by the Duke immediately made Klauvis happy and even with his voice: "Knocking the dead The mage is the one who should be charged on the stake. Even the Bishop of Ronis..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the School of Magic, Bishop Roones frowned after listening to the reports of the great priest and the head of Roland. "Is there such a thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can guarantee that it is definitely a hand of the Necromancer. If you are not the ones they are waiting for, those ambushes The swordsman will never do it." The great god officer lowered his voice and emphasized the seriousness of the matter. "These all indicate that the priest may have some collusion with the Necromancer...not to say that there must be a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Ronis frowns slowly Shake his head and shake his head. "No..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cusbert Great Officer said with a firm head: "But the truth is in front of us and we don't believe it. I think we should Investigate. Now send someone to pick him up..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Ronis interrupted the words of the great priest and asked: "You said the swordsmen and When is the time for the Necromancer to fight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The guess from the body should be this morning..."<br /><br />&nbsp; Bishop Rooney looked at the big priest and said softly: "This morning he and I discussed some of theological issues in the study alone, so it is absolutely irrelevant to him."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cousbert immediately stopped. After a while, I will slow down and say: "But are you not alone in the study?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I did not pay attention to you quietly calling him. "But it." Bishop Ronis waved and pressed the words that the great priest wanted to say. "This thing must be just a coincidence. There is no such thing as the Necromancer in the vicinity of Wang Du, so as not to cause everyone to panic. The last time we can be scared, we will investigate it privately. Let's go and arrange it. I am tired to take a break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exited from the Cathedral Cousbert’s great priest’s attitude towards the apparently partial attitude of the bishop’s adult, he expressed extreme dissatisfaction and his indignation He said: "It’s too much. Since the kid didn’t know where it came from, the bishop’s adult has completely changed. Not only do he often intervene in politics, but he also promotes the completely unrecognized guy to a great priest. This time it is very obvious. Covering up is something else that is still okay and this is related to the Necromancer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of Roland is silent and thoughtful. Cousbert suddenly silenced from the excitement and thought about it for a while. "What will happen to the future of the Magic Academy? The bishop seems to be old."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s head flashed a bit and will be a big priest The latter half of the story forced back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of Roland, who came back from the headquarters of the Paladin, knew that the Duke’s words were indeed correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Twenty years ago, the turmoil in the Eastern 6th and the Imperial Civil War were all Bishops of Ronis calming his prestige, both in the church and in the empire. It is absolutely unshakable. Since he is committed to creating that guy, he will naturally cover him. There is no real evidence. No matter what kind of thing, his prestige and status have ways to deal with the past with ease." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But after all, this is related to the Necromancer about the bishop and he will not condone him."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Necromancer..." The Duke smiled and thought of a previous thing. "I think the bishop should know more than anyone else about what is going on. But I am not good at it. Even if I go out, I don’t know what effect it will have. It’s good for the time being." The Duke thought I want to smile and be kind and kind. He said to Clauses: "You should help your master to let him know the truth. It is best to find someone to prove it to others or to others, even if it proves that it will not be decisive. But it’s good to let our respected bishops have a little trouble. After all, the more chaotic the situation, the better it is for us. As long as you don’t expose ourselves, you should try to make the contradictions too big to get out of hand.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Clavis answered with great enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of Roland found Crowes after returning from the School of Magic. As the Duke expected, he had something to do with Clause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
