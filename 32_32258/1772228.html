Talis frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nodded: "I am confident that I am very confident in him. With his heart and the city, you can bring the guy here."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the place where the Queens and the Bishop Jiawei met when they saw the city outside the city. They are still lurking in the grass not far away. It is now impossible to use the dark elves' deep darkness under the broad daylight, but Asa is not worried about being present. Asa and Talis are absolutely enough to hide their breath before they can be shot. The black elf is not to mention the lurking nature of her race. And Rhodes Hart will naturally attract Javey’s attention. And no matter how good a person is, as long as his attention is not concentrated, it can also be a loophole everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the heart of Rhode Hart, if he went to the Cardinal to tell the trace of the vampire, please come over and watch him. He must not bring the extra entourage. And all the spirits must have been placed on this issue is the perfect opportunity to ambush sneak attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is your weapon not taken back?" asked the black elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa silently said: "It should be enough for four people to deal with that guy empty hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The black elf sneered with disdain and said: "I don't think it's so shy. I just hope that you won't lose our lives because of your shyness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Asa thought about it. Sighed and said: "Not to mention that it is not very far from the School of Magic. I am afraid that when I use the land, the priest will be aware of the fluctuations and it will be difficult for people to come."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time there were two long-lost figures in the distance. The three immediately calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two figures are slowly approaching here. It is the Lord Bishop's side that is the Rhodes. And as it was planned, Bishop Javi did not follow any entourage. The face of the heart is full of strange and anxious look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop, you see this is the trace of my current vampire." Rhodeh's face pointed heavily at the ground mound, one of them already has Traces of excavation. Half of the body was exposed inside. "There were buried these blood-sucking bodies and all of them were wandering teenagers in the kingdom. So I am sure that the vampire must exist and become more and more awkward. The murderer we caught was obvious. It’s awkward.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s far away, Asa can still see the expression and movement of Rhodes. He had to be proud of his judgment. Rhode Hart’s heart and the city were indeed deep. Even if he knew that the cardinal in front of him was the murderer of the empressing queen, he was the black hand of the vampire event, but he is now acting. Still a word of speech. There is really no flaw in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well..." Bishop Javey was absent-minded and nodded. He looked at the mounds on the ground and turned his head and looked deeply at Rhodes. Hart glanced. “How many people know about this matter?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s heart tightened a bit and he naturally felt the meaning of this sentence. But now is not the best time to shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are still many people who know." Rhodes answered with a sigh of relief. "These are also known to many of the squad leaders of the Paladins who are present in the mission."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After you go back Command them. This must be kept secret..." Bishop Jia Wei sighed and nodded and nodded and bent down and seemed to want to take a closer look at the mounds on the ground. At the same time his hand seemed to touch the hilt of the waist intentionally or unintentionally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no harbinger of a sword-like sword light from the cardinal waist suddenly vacant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the side of him, Rhodes also flew back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt’s movements and support are absolutely fast enough. Asa even sure that even if he is in the same position, his reaction will not be perfect. The sword-like light that passed through him was still passing over his chest. This sword is too fast, without the slightest murderousness and the sign of the shot. It is almost a hit with a random action of a bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do with the bishop?" Rhodes's horrified face flashed the white magic light and stopped the blood, but the sword has definitely hurt him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing that only those people who know these things are less..." Dr. Jia Wei said that the blood on the sword was faint. "You can rest assured that you will still go back and command the Paladin. But from now on, it is exactly what I meant..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a moment at this time The shadow of the white light suddenly appeared from the deep grass not far away, like a smashing arrow toward the cardinal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a great mobile phone now, but Asa can no longer wait for him to wait. Necromancer magic is too late to use his electric shot from the hiding place. It took only two blinks to rush to the front of Bishop Javey with a violent white light and a raging roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this sudden emergence of the enemy Cardinal slightly wrong, but immediately lifted the sword to meet. A brighter, faster, and more intense white light flashed from his hand than the previous one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deja vu. This is the first feeling that Asa saw this sword light. But he has no time to think about it. Where did he see this sword light so strong that he could barely bear the temperament of his hands, but it was just enough to resist Jianfeng. And this sword is raging. The dignity of the dignity. It seems that a tsunami made a mountain and then turned into a viper and finally became this light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of fists and long swords have been stabbed, bumped, bumped, hit, caught, and cut many times in an instant. The air generated by the violent collision produced a burst of thunderous sound. Asa desperately wants to catch or sway the sword and send it to the other side. But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't succeed but took a step back in the constant confrontation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time he was shocked. Although he has estimated the strength of this young cardinal is very high, he has not underestimated him until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even this battle is still quite stable. Although he was a step slower than him, Talis and the Black Elf have already arrived. It should be no problem to deal with this opponent with the strength of three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal seems to have noticed the unfavorable situation of the situation, and then re-educated and then sent out the sword. This time, Jianguang was actually more turbulent than the previous one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if there are any important memories, there is a desire to come out. However, Asa did not have a little bit of mind to capture that he must not retreat or the Cardinal will use this space to withdraw. Meditation has been fully opened. He has seen the infinite sword in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when he whipped up all the power and fighting spirit to meet this sword light, a cool feeling suddenly came out from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thin feeling penetrated his skin and broke the muscles from the two ribs into the right lung and then in the same straight line from the chest Transmitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meditation completes all the touches in a complete and detailed way into the feeling. Asa even heard how each muscle was cut off how it was torn and blood rushed out of the alveoli causing convulsions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter who sees his chest revealing a sword tip, he only feels horrible but Asa is not that he only feels amazement and anger Almost let him forget the pain of the chest. He knows who this is the sword. Know who can pierce such a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the sword light in the hands of a red bishop has already flashed through him. He immediately fell like a pocket that had been evacuated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his physical strength and fighting spirit, even if his hands and feet are slaughtered, he will not be so weak. But the cardinal's sword was all passed through his joints exactly like the scalpel in the hands of Sandro, and all his power disappeared immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft fell to the ground Asa just can see the back of Rhodes Hart by being filled with his own blood pressure, almost seeing a bloody red eye Asa Seeing that Rodhart’s handsome face had no uneasiness, as if he had just smashed his best friend from behind, the sword was completely justified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Asa fully understood what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed a trap but not a trap for the Cardinal but a trap for himself. He did not look at the city of Rhodes. It is indeed a deep-minded machine. It is only enough that the city and the heart are used to deal with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indignant indignation in the chest swelled into a low, low-beasted roar in the throat, but was immediately coughed by the blood from the lungs. A large blood spurted out of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the original allies suddenly from the back of the sword, Asa from the stabbed cool to the half of the Temple Knight and the Black Elves are in unison After exclaiming but exclaiming, the reaction of the two of them was completely different. Talis was angry and yelled at Bishop Javey and Rhodes Hart and the Xuan Elves turned and ran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica’s choice is undoubtedly much more correct than Talis. But at this time, there seems to be no difference in what kind of choices. Bishop Jia Wei has taken a reel from behind. The white magic's volatility flashed past Jessica's light in the week of paralysis, and suddenly fell to the ground like a puppet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the evil necromancer actually..." Talis did not have the chance to finish her nonsense. Immediately involved in the storm of the cardinal of the Cardinal. I was too late to be told. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think it was Talis Knight. When did you actually get together with this guy? This surprised me. Lancelot taught The good apprentice. Bishop Jia Wei sneered. The sword on the hand has been attacked several times with Talis's sword.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis Back angered: "Hey. The guy like you is lurking in the Glorious Castle. I must... give me the Devil's Blade in the name of the Lord..." She had to shut up and change her mouth immediately. She used a blessing technique to resist it. The opposite side stabbed the sword.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the name of the Lord, I was given the Devil's Blade. The Cardinal sneered at the same time and slammed the same prayer. The white light lit up on his sword, whether it was the degree of casting or the magical power of the sword was much better than that used by the horsewoman. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people’s collisions with the intensive double swords are separated again. Talis is retreating. A piece of gold also appears on her forehead. A blood stain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without the brilliance, do you think you are my opponent?" "The Cardinal and Talis both ignited the same white magic light at the same time. The two men fought again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt I didn’t have a shot to help him see the strength early. Finally, Talis was kicked on the stomach with a kick and painfully bent down. Jia Wei then added a palm to her neck and she also Planted to the ground.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lancelot kindly let you out to hide you but hit me in my hand. This is good enough for me to seize a handle against him. His disciples actually came together with the wanted criminal who had assassinated Bishop Ronis and Bishop Ashur, and believed that no matter who they were, they would be very interested in this matter. Bishop Jia Wei looked at the knight who promoted consciousness and smiled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a group of people began to appear slowly in the distance. They were surrounded by formations. Move here. These people are all dressed in the same pace and movements, but everyone's footsteps are very light and fluent, but they are almost silently close to here. These hundreds of people are actually quite The master of the standard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa coughed out a bite of blood. He really felt the pain of digging the lungs. He could hear that his alveoli were bleeding from the bones. Even the heart seems to fall. But he still can't help but smile. He knows that this group of people are members of the Paladin. There are hundreds of people here. I am afraid that the entire Paladin will come. The timing is even so empty that if you decide that your attention must be concentrated on the cardinal and will not be close to them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but even this Just now Rhode Hart and Javey Teaching the two people’s performances is still so hard and hard to see the hard work and hard work of this trap. He did lose. Although he still feels that it is difficult for Rhodehart to rely on this Queen’s Necromancer. Confidence, but the fact that the facts are already in front of your own chest is more persuasive than anything and inferences.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
