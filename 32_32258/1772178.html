			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop." A shout in the dull air also seemed to be clear and clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilioli stopped to look a little surprised and looked back at the elf girl who shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enclose them." Luya waved her hand and told the elves who had just left the way to surround the thieves outside the black area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika did not say that he only reached out and pulled an elf prisoner from the thief. His big fan-like hand screamed on the head of the elf and the scream of the elf and the overwhelming snoring of the skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s useless." Luya’s voice and expression are excited but it’s not just the panic and the lack of anger and fortitude. . She stunned that Shelikka, who is still killing her compatriots, is like a skinny hunter and a fierce giant bear in confrontation, at least in terms of imposing manner and spirit. She said coldly: "The holy things will not give you guys and don't want to go out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" The muscles of the Helicel hand jumped this elf The captive's head was immediately blasted by huge force. But it wasn't actually intentional because the unexpected anger made him lose control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw from the eyes of the female elf that the intimidation that now sees bleeding has no effect. No matter what emotions have a limit, as long as the limit is exceeded, people can override and be emotional rather than emotional. He occasionally encounters such a person who is afraid and then calm when he tortures people and kills people. However, very few of these people do not even have the courage to face the fear and pain. There are also many people who are going crazy before these emotions are tortured. But this seemingly weak and elf girl has such perseverance and courage that the eyes should have appeared in the eyes of the human warriors who have survived life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let you escape from here again, you will have more elves in your hands next time. And if you let them take them Only the slaves and playthings of human beings are better than death. The dignity of the elves is gone." Watching Helikon kill the elf. Lucia’s face did not have the unbearable and hesitant, but the anger and excitement went one step further. As she said, she started to sneak into the black area and rushed to the ground in front of the ground. The voice of her voice and expression drove the spirit of each elf around her, even the spirits of the elves who were groggy in the hands of the thieves. "They died here and they sacrificed to defend their homeland. Their souls will coexist in this land. And you will pay for their death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Lloyd looked at Lucia's slight nod and quite a bit of an unexpected taste but more of a compliment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muscles on the face of Shelikka are no longer subject to him by shaking their opponents, and they are determined to destroy them. In this case, only positive battles are the only way out. The battle below means that he can't even capture an elf. Being able to escape this forest is a success. The huge plans of this painstaking operation have all become bamboo baskets and waters, and even the entire Shamuthi thief may have been destroyed here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the eyes can have the shape of the Greek card, the eyes of the elf girl have been chopped into meat slag. Huge anger and killings are boiling in his heart and the blood in his eyes is getting heavier and heavier. In the end, he suddenly laughed like a monster with flesh and blood in hell. "Hahaha... It’s interesting. How much will you cost you to try it? I promise not to let you down." He raised his voice and yelled at the thieves. "You are all ready for me to cut off these elves immediately. Then everyone will go out and kill them to kill these bitches."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but For the screaming of other thieves in Helicel, it is the answer. Many people's faces are not good-looking. They are far less arrogant and murderous than the boss, knowing that they are going to die can be so unscrupulous. Looking at the close-up Luya and the group of magical summoned around her, almost everyone's face showed a fear of color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few strange cracking sounds faintly from the distance and the air seemed to vibrate slightly. It’s just that the spirit of most people here is innocent and not many people care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Asa’s attention is placed there. It doesn't seem like the blast after the magical explosion. He doesn't notice any huge magical fluctuations. But he can feel that the magical enchantments of the elves are all shaking slightly. This should be the enchantment of the elves who were forcibly penetrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still no movement in the wizard's transmission magic array. Cedros and Gru don't know why it seems to have not come yet. Although it may be more dangerous to know that staying here before they came, Asa did not leave. The leaves of the world tree are still here. Maybe he can protect the Luya when he walks here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Lloyd must have noticed the turmoil of the magical enchantment, but his face does not see any strange eyes or staring at the battlefield ahead. He suddenly shouted: "Elder Luya is right. I swear in the name of the great Marfa that I will never let any evil slayer who kills the elves out of the forests of Tulaion. They will all die miserably. Under the great natural magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Lloyd’s voice is very loud and loud, but it’s just enough to make people feel shocked by this voice. Such a huge sound is actually a thin body from him. The faces of many thieves are immediately in the face of this huge and deterrent voice, even if the priests of the church in the name of God do not violate it, and the dead-headed races like elves come to their own gods. The oath is that they can't live alive. There are nearly a hundred wizard wizards around you who definitely have this strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the words of Elder Lloyd’s words: "But anyone who regrets for their own crimes can get the forgiveness of Marfa. I swear in the name of Mafa. The person who handed over the hostages on hand. We guarantee that he can walk out safely here. Just take the elf out of the black magical area.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the thieves are moving. The pressure and lure of this sentence at the same time in front of the sentence at the same time. The most peripheral thieves suddenly rushed to the outside against the elf prisoner and shouted: "I surrender. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Fox* Your ancestors eighteen generations. "Hilika's bloody eyes screamed at Elder Lloyd. He didn't notice when the elder elder came, but the old man's mouth was just two or three sentences, and the thieves were defeated without fighting. He originally thought With the power of all the thieves here, hard to get out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, dozens of thieves took their captives and ran out of the black area. The elves immediately gave The companions who came out were loosened. Then they tied the thieves with the rope that had just tied the elves.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No run. "Silika screamed a sword and slashed a thief running outside with a captive on his shoulder. But this has no more thieves to start running outside. In order to compete for the captives of the elves, they mobilized each other's knives. Even if they were not captured, they began to rush out of the black area and surrendered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thief threw himself on the ground and slammed it but still supported the reel on his hand. He knew that he would not be the object of being detained by the elf anyway, no matter what the elf of the devil was, not to mention the scroll of the hell flame. Killed more than a dozen elves.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cara bang. The sound is close to a lot of elves. There are white lights in the direction of the sound. And these sounds More and more intensively sounds like someone is constantly cutting something.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The thorns prison. "Ruya waved the leaves of the world tree to Helicika. The wattle on the ground with him as the center is getting more and more thick and thick. Some of them are entangled in him from the bottom of Helica. The body of his body immediately had more stalks wrapped up in the blink of an eye. The body of Hilika was full of thick wattles. These stalks are all spikes like steel nails. The other thieves stabbed at the same time they were wounded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the spikes are obviously not available for the steel-like muscles of Helicika. Helica roared and struggled with the thorns that might even be able to bind the rhinoceros, and suddenly began to break, but immediately there was a new wattle that was entangled. This magic was actually used in the hands of other wizards. But the only thorns that emerged from the ground are all the natural thorns. The use of Luya, which holds the leaves of the world tree, is not only as simple as breaking the black area. The effect is also several times.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&  ; only this delayed elf prisoner has been brought out of the black area by the thieves.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remaining in addition to Helicika There are also nearly a hundred thieves who have just killed the elves or have not captured the elves who have surrendered. The only way out now seems to be to rush out with them and immediately rush them up with them. The thorns that bound the Hika card slashed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was two nephews and three donkeys that had grown bigger under the wizard's magic. After Lucia’s spell, their little bodies began to tremble. Then, like a blown-frozen candy doll, it was only a few breathful hours. The poisonous insects reached a level of terror under the screams of the thieves. The two scorpions are as big as a cow. The two huge tails in front of the cow are one foot long. Needless to say, it is fatal to wave as a weapon. The two cockroaches become full of pythons. Just looking at the appearance and volume is enough to make people creepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the execution of the law, Luya began to lead the escorts along with these huge poisonous insects and began to re-enter the thieves. The voices of the thieves have begun to move closer to the woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"*What is this? Is it a trick? This chick is so good." Hilton screamed and stunned with several of his associates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid Anderson has restored the human form. Frowning looked down and said: "This seems to be the power of the dragon... the highest in natural magic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fuck you know? Boss this What the hell is it?” Hilton’s distrust of the restoration of the humanoid Druid seems to be that his old solid wood looks like a lack of persuasiveness to pull Asa’s sleeves. Now the boss is in a high position in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Asa turned a blind eye to the other direction. Although he knows everything that is born here, all the spirits are paying attention to the sound that is getting closer and closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cracking sound of the cockroach is getting closer and closer, and the ground is also beginning to tremble slightly in the vibration. There have been many elves watching the situation here has stabilized. I ran to the place where the sound came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa land brows wrinkled. He didn't say anything to stop the elves who ran there because he also felt that things were not right. This kind of sound is not the more fierce and fierce that magic can come out. It is just like a sly giant holding a giant axe in the forest leading to the road to open up the road for himself. This kind of voice definitely does not conform to the character and style of the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa jumped on a tree and finally saw more than a dozen figures that were approaching here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is definitely no Necromancer. Because the light of those people's side is not the flames of the sky, but the white waves of white magic that are like the radiance of the sun. Same as the Knight of the Goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical enchantment of the elves is forcibly broken into the elves. The elves are probably controlling the magical power of the entire enchantment to stop them from entering. All the trees, flowers and animals in the vicinity of the intruders were enchanted by the enchantment, and a tree was struggling to become a huge dead wood guard. Take a huge step and wave your arms to attack them. The vines on the ground seem to be madly growing endlessly rushing into their bodies, and countless variegated poisonous worms are rushing to the crab-sized poisonous spider, the lynx, and the tiny venomous snake. It has the same thickness as a leech. As they move. Within a few tens of meters of the radius, it has become a sea of ​​madness and murder. But in such an eccentric and madness, the group of people in the ocean is like a rock in a stormy sea, or a rock that is squarely but sturdy and stable. It is not just a storm. Probably even if they are falling apart, they are all so stable and straightforward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are striding forward but not madly attacking around the run and not hindering their footsteps and failing to change their route. There is no such thing as an imposing manner. There are a few words that are elaborated: although they are arrogant, they are thousands of people. Just looking at this short, that is, in the blink of an eye, Asa was shocked by this momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is for a tall man. A long, brown shawl was full of scars on the face, but the scar on his masculine face was not synonymous with courage and medal. The brilliance of the body is soft and powerful. Like all the poisonous insects and the vines that the magic spawned, all of them are burned and forced to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who was next to him and accompanied him in a red cardinal costume, but whoever looks at it will see that he is this The collar of the group. He walked forward with the expression of a leisurely pavilion, but his posture and momentum were incomparably majestic and pressed like a strolling lion. More than half of the omnipotent momentum that the whole group has shed is from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
