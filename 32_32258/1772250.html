			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the magical array in the Descartes Valley lights up and then dissipates a figure in the center of the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer magic array here is probably the one with the least use on the Big 6 and the most mysterious and most majestic transfer magic array. No matter who is facing this, the purple scrolls carrying the scrolls are all fearful. But the next action of this person in the magic array immediately spit on the magical array below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought the guy was so bold that he dared to put a trap on the transfer magic array here." The man snorted and wiped his own The saliva walked out of the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait for a long time. How is the attitude of Deya Valley for a long time of 20 years? Dear Sandron former acting president." The old man sitting on the stone bench not far away sighed and closed the book in his hand. His thin, black, black robe and well-defined face and his deep eyes look like a wise scholar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru rolled his eyes and saw the old man glimpsed. "Stephen? Is it you? Didn't you hear that you traveled to the sea for more than a decade ago without any news? I thought you were swallowed by the sea monster on the road or died on the belly of a beautiful woman in the Far East."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Twenty years without seeing you still smell like temper and stinky." The old man, known as Stephen, smiled and smiled and gestured for a cup of steam on his hand. The wrinkles on the face of the tea are wrinkled out with a very kind smile. Several goats on the squat must be slightly shaken like a very well-preserved tea house owner. "Don't stand there and sit down. Don't miss the tea that this Qingyingquan made? This is the best tea I have just brought from the Far East. I guarantee that you are the second person to taste this big 6". Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You just came back? Then you heard about the things that the young people made at these times?" Sandro was cold in the distance not far from Stephen. A cry. He did not sit down but stood there straight. "Now the young people are too courageous to put too much hands and feet too open... I want to teach those young people today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Go to class? Do you want to teach them lessons?" Stephen smiled. "Do you dare to do the same noble necromancer under the sacred dark star in the whistle valley? Even if it seems to you, it would be too much for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "They didn't do it for Vadrina's chick?" Sandro snorted again. There was a murderous murder on his body that filled the black and white eyes and was afraid of people. The white place is as pale as the skin of a dead person. It seems that some places with dark bodies are like black holes leading to the abyss of the earth. You can swallow away the people in front of you at any time. "I said earlier that I wouldn't let him go if I was in this whistle valley or on my head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephan sipped a cup of tea A smile: "A big murder. I haven't seen you like this for at least 30 years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandrusen replied: "Because there are at least three No one dared to provoke me like this for ten years. Tell me where the guy is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He knows that he has failed. You will come to him to settle him. How can you continue to stay in Deya Valley?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I asked him where he is? Don't you still don't know?" Shande looked at Stephen. I turned my head and walked towards the valley. "I will ask other people if you don't say that I will start until you say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be too self-willed. Here is the Descarte." Stephen Looking at Sandre's back lightly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know I don't need your reminder. And I advise you not to stop me." Sandru did not turn back and did not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His stride is still not as slow as he was. But around every time he settled. The green grass on the grass instantly withered and rotted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephan was still sitting on the stone bench but the brows were slightly wrinkled. He bent his finger on the teacup on the palm of his hand and flew the teacup silently and quickly to the back of Sandro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But almost when the teacup had just left Stephen’s hand, Sandro had the feeling that he suddenly turned around and the murderousness in his eyes had become alive. volcanic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are too nervous with a cup of tea." Stephen sat there faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cup is in front of Sandro but Sandro did not reach out. He just looked coldly at Stephen's eyes and was not sharp or sharp, but the cold and corpse's unique meaning could easily blend into the body of the person he was watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not coming to drink tea." Sandrud said lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said don't stop me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not stopping you just asking you to drink The cup of tea calms down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't need to be calm and don't need you to gossip."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Not what you need. Drink it." With this sound, it was a cough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice comes from a short old man who is lying on his body and he slowly walks out from the shade of the trees. He seemed to have been standing there for a long time but even Shandru did not notice his presence before he spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old half-bend, talk, walk, every move will bring out a cough, it seems that a little bigger wind can blow him I have to fall down and die. But Sandro looked at the pupils he appeared, but he suddenly screamed and said: "Shante? Are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't it be me?" The old man coughed and walked slowly to the front of Sandro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are so poor and work, you are waiting here, I am a little afraid to do it. I thought you were staying in your cemetery and still no longer." Then I’m worried about the whistle valley.” Shan Delu looked at him coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not worry about it. You also know that the young people nowadays seem to be restless even if they are not sensible." I didn’t see Shandru on the chair, but I just curled up and coughed on the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chair in front of the mountain is cautious and very hard. It seems that coughing has become the meaning of his life. On the rear chair, Stephen took the teapot next to him and poured a cup of tea. Both of them seemed very relaxed and comfortable, as if they didn't care about Sandron among them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to these two people, Sandro’s face began to have an unprecedented dignity. He stood still in the same place, but his eyes kept on the bodies of the two Necromancers. He is very clear about the strength of the two men. If the two men really joined hands, what kind of situation is he guessed that he didn't even have the confidence to pick it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest's robes on Sandro have begun to burst into a haze from his body in the whistle of a very small but dense knot. The general fluctuations swirl around his body. The cup in the air still in front of him began to tremble slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s right for Sandro. You are running alone, Descartes, Ronis, and you’re no longer afraid of someone taking the opportunity to get that thing?” Stephen I suddenly remembered asking. "I know that you still have some helpers, but they can't stand on the same position as you do with Ronis. If they know the true face of that thing, what will they do? Doubt? Fear? Or... Interested ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru still didn't move but the floating cup in front of him suddenly swayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wangdu is in the study room of the Prime Minister's Office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the thing in Mr. Sandro’s hand or in the dungeon under the cathedral?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, this is a small question, but everyone’s eyes are equally focused on Asa. This is also the question they want to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stunned and hesitated a little and replied, "I don't know, don't ask me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; But after just answering this, he immediately sighed. Everyone here is watching him and everyone's ability to observe and see is not his unnatural look can be confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
