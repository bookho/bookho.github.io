			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already a huge elf war ancient tree, but there is still no elf in the field of vision. The Tamik Knight threatens the elves to vacate a large enough range. It is temporarily similar to an uninhabited forest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old war tree has been restored to its original appearance, and the well water of the Sun Well still supplies the growth of ancient trees, three The wreckage of the war has been collected by the elves and piled under the tree. The broken huge residual limbs are like three huge piles of garbage.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knife is like a black The lightning shook straight down, brushed from Asa's side, and pulled a deep trench on the ground. Asa rolled out two buckets alongside and crashed into a cockroach's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, I surrender." Asa jumped into the sly body and screamed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the Tamik Knight has not wanted to wait now, but it has been smashed over. And this knife is more fierce than the one that just forced him to stop. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original person who thought he could catch up within two or three breaths used four or five breaths, originally thought that he could take a knife for his arm. Actually, he was hiding. He found out that his judgment actually had some small deviations. Or every time the opponent’s movements seemed to be more flexible, the effects of the two white magic seemed to be unexpectedly good. And it has been playing a role in this person's body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Asa spoke out and waited, the Tamik Knight could even be sure of himself. Can't wait. He now knows that this opponent's escape is ulterior motive. Although it is still unclear, he knows that it is best not to let this intention succeed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔嚓One. The Tamik Knight found that he was still in the middle of this knife. Asa reached out and took a foot off the shackle. The green foot broke and flew up, and he also avoided.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamik Knight retreats a bit and settles. He knows himself In a big way, I have always regarded this opponent as a waste that has no power to fight back. There is a flaw between the knife and the knife, and even the knife is not complete, which will make him again and again. I ducked in the past. So he stepped back and concentrated, and then he went out again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a knife after the sorrow, and it has completely recovered the calmness of the sea. The knife's momentum, and the taste of death that is integrated with the knife's momentum. This moment instantly envelopes and locks the space within ten meters, so that it is absolutely impossible to avoid it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A muffled sound. This knife was blocked. Not only was it blocked, but the power of the shock from the knife also made the Tamik Knight’s hand feel sour. He even Two steps back. The face of the wood is all incredible.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was surprised that the country was blocked by this knife, but because it blocked this It’s not Asa, it’s a huge cockroach.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just after the Tamek Knights retreat A little bit of gaze, Asa is also condensing. But he is not ready to move or dodge, but prepares the magic that has already been condensed in his hands, and then presses on the body of the war shackles under him. Then when the Tamik Knights were cut, the two huge sickles of the war had just been waved and blocked in front of Asa.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The strength of the Tamik Knight is stronger, bigger, and fierce. It is impossible to cut this kind of weapon that is as wide as the door panel and definitely harder than any door panel. The knife that he has included in this knife, Skills, murderous killings are already the ultimate in the military, and the movements are simple, but this is not a martial art or a repair gap. Just like a person can never be more than an elephant. There is power. So he was shaken back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamik Knight now understands why this opponent will run away, why he will run away here. But he is still 10,000 I can't figure it out. A senior white devil who has used the bishop level twice. How can a person with law still have such ample magical power to drive such a huge body?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamik Knight himself, although Yan will not use Necromancer But it doesn't mean you don't understand. The body other than humans can't be transformed into zombies. It's just more difficult. Only the human body can easily resonate with the dead magic. The other creatures that transform zombies are bigger. The more magical power is consumed, the more difficult it is to operate. Turning such a huge war shack into a zombie. The magic power needed should not be borne by the opponents of this magical martial arts.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is a human or a corpse, the action after conversion to a zombie will be slow. But the speed of the two sickles that had just lifted up could actually catch up with him. And now this sly zombie is very flexible and turns around and climbs up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This war only has the upper half of the body, the internal organs fall off the break and drag on the ground, the body is full of scars left after the magic bombardment And the wound, it looks like a pile of rubbish. But now its movements seem to be much more flexible than before. The broken body is upright, and two huge sickles bring out the same huge winds to the Tamik Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamik Knight retreats, he only retreats, although these two huge sickles are just simple hits, but he only retreats, can not resist. He glanced at Asa, who was standing on the shackle, and the murder of his eyes was gone, then he turned and ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From chasing to escape, there is only a few blinks of effort. But the Tamik Knight did not hesitate to make such a huge gap. He escaped the same determination as when he was chasing. This requires not only judgment but also decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was already at the peak of victory, but in an instant I found myself having to accept failure. This mentality is not something that ordinary people can follow. Generally speaking, no matter how small the possibility, people can't help but go to the nursery school and try to see if they can save it. But the Tamik Knight did not try to recover like an ordinary person. He even said that his chances of recovery were not too small, but he was still able to use his most sensible judgment to decide his actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can see that his strength is already at a disadvantage, so he retreats and flees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s just such a monster, he’s not completely unable to do it, but the most important thing is to have an Asa. He only now found out that he really looked down on this opponent. He thought that the victory was in the grip. It only revealed a small flaw and gap, and he could actually turn it over and take the absolute advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital that he turned over has not been seen until now, and he does not understand how such a martial artist who is already very good can still have so much magic. I also don't understand that such a huge wound can only be restored to such a level with two advanced healing magic. He can't see through, so he doesn't want to take the risk and try to see if he can save it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the gray figure of the Tamik Knight quickly rushed into the forest, Asa only felt admired by this opponent at this time, although fighting power, mind and The means are already at their peak, but the decision-making power that can be put on is the real power. This can only show that the person's mind and feelings have been honed to the fact that the meteorite is generally hard and seamless, and that such a heart is almost flawless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direction of the Tamik Knights is the direction in which the magical array is transmitted. Luya and the leaves of the world tree are there, and both Talis and Abin Still life and death, Asa knows that he must chase. But even the powerful white magic recovery can not completely restore the combat power of the people, so Asa can only rely on this to fight, but this only the last half of the body, fast movement is impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mind commanded the cockroach to move to another corpse corpse, and he took a deep breath, his hands raised, and all the magical power in his body turned into The living corpse, a group of blue light began to bloom between his hands. It is only at the side of the Sunwell that with the effect of the Sunwell's fluctuations constantly adding to the magical power and magical increase, he can also use the living corpse to control the war, such a monster that is inferior. Even though the well water in the sun well is almost dry, the effect of the ban is almost no, but at such a close distance, the fluctuation is enough to raise his magical power to the level of Sandro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the blue light, the corpses that piled up were squirming, and then joined together like a large group of mucous grotesques. Only a huge twist, a green monster with three heads and a dozen feet formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue light of the living corpse dissipated in the hand, Asa looked at the foot like the three clay sculptures that were pinched together by the child and squatted. Have to be a little disappointed. Although the magic is abundant, but the magic trick is still far from being comparable to Sandru, even the three wings of the intrinsic wings are combined, it seems that they can't fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current nature is not a time to study the styling problem, although not flying, but the feet of those messy combinations can not move. Asa's consciousness operation, the following ten feet moved quickly, dragging the huge body of the combination into the direction of the Tamik Knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
