			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two are all well said, and they are all according to their respective stench temper." Ai's mother sighed and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The most crucial point is that real meditation is the way to make people see the real thing. Only the real soul and soul can communicate with the Dark Star. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the truth of your own heart. Just a simple practice." It is impossible to reach the ideal realm of this meditation. Only when you face your own heart, you can see your own desires from the heart." Ai's mother nodded and pointed to Asa's chest. "Seeing the truest self is the true meaning of this meditation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know why almost no magician has been able to cultivate this book all the time. Meditate? Because they are too smart, there are too many things in their heads." Ai's mother-in-law sighed for a long time and continued. "Since the Ajibad adults founded the Necromancer Association, the Masters of the Diya Valley are all outstanding in the secular world. Everyone's mind is very intelligent. They can become human beings and have a lot of thoughts. The weight is also the leader of mankind. But because of this, they can't practice real meditation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When people are too smart, they like to use Think about it, not feel it with your heart. If you have too much thought, you can't directly face your heart, so they can't practice this real meditation. The practice of forcing the practitioner will cause the magic power in the body to completely lose control. , Crash."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hehehehe...a magician, it is never possible to let his heart be above his mind. Instead, the butchers who sell meat on the street, the bandits who play homes, it is easy to do this. There is a saying that every song is a dog. This is about the truth."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out so...it seems like this "Asa nodded. Shandruna seems to be a bit savage and has no head and brain personality. It really is not like the charm of a magician. It is no wonder that he can become a person who practiced real meditation in the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He created the Necromancer Association, which is the only smartest, most capable and talented person to enter, but the land is simple to use. The highest meditation for practice... Akibad, the biggest magical genius in the history of the continent, is he making a huge joke, or is it another deep meaning?” Ai’s mother-in-law smiled. a bit. "But this may be the reason why he warns the Necromancer that he should be clear and unconcerned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have left these Diya Valleys for so many years. I gradually understood. Real meditation I used to practice before, but found that I can't. Now, maybe I have gradually got the clear and high mentality, but I don't want to practice again."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nodded and said, "I cultivated that meditation technique is only an accidental opportunity. It was also used as a meditation of ordinary magic at the beginning."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really good for you to cultivate real meditation from your character. But to reach a truly perfect state, you still have to really face your heart, including ugliness and It's weak. It's hard, but I know you've done it." Ai's mother-in-law's smile is very kind. "So I said. You have grown up. It is true. After your heart is fully mature, the real meditation has reached the realm of completion. Asa remembered his experience in the magical dungeon, the day It is by using the true meditation to integrate the leaves of the world tree with the power of the sun well. Only then can he break the prison and resolve the crisis at that time. He asks: "The leaves of the world tree and the sun well..... ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world tree leaf and sun well are the relics left by the ancient elves, condensing the power of life and the sun, just the power of the dark star conflict. With these two forces, you really have the ability to hold the black star without hurting, using the black star. In other words, you do qualify as the person in the Akibad prophecy. "The voice of Ai's mother-in-law paused, slowly. Very solemnly said one word at a time: "But with qualifications, it is not really. Just this test you have seen yourself, your own heart." And compatible with the Dark Star, so you will let go. Don't hold it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That means....."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, you actually Not that person. It’s not that prophecy. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of Ai’s mother-in-law began to become very relaxed. Just like when I explained the questions to him, I said faintly: “While you have the ability, you have no heart, and those who have been empowered by the sun well and the leaves of the world tree. You are not the first one for five hundred years. There is nothing strange about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out to be like this." Asa took a long sigh of relief. The last trace of doubt in the chest finally dissipated. Even if it is a prophecy that you don't believe much, it is easy to know that you really have nothing to do with yourself. In fact, I want to come, too, I didn’t have that mind. Speaking of the head, whether it is the sun well and the leaves of the world tree, the real meditation, these are just things that are occasionally obtained, and they are just because of the interrelationship, they are involved in the whirlpool created by those people. Even if he has become the center of this whirlpool, the law is to calm the storm. I am actually just an outsider. This is finally a complete, unquestionable affirmation, and suddenly open in the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, mother-in-law." Asa nodded heavily. "Whether you are Ai Rui Nair or who, no matter what your relationship with me, you are the most grateful person in my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Her mother-in-law smiled very kindly, but Asa did not notice the deepest part of this smile, and some were deeply bitter and helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the rest is just to find a place to hide this. Ronnis, the old-fashioned guy, if he is willing to soften, come to me. Give this ring to him, maybe there is no such thing now. It took a lot of effort to create a secret room to seal, and there are so many magic enchantments, and the end is not a waste of effort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nodded and thought about it. Suddenly asked: "Right, why did Shanduan break the hilt and bring Diya Valley?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you ask him about this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I asked, but he refused to say. "Asa shook her head and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know exactly what happened. I was suffering from a minor injury when I was assassinated by Pope Decan. I was in a place to rest." Mother-in-law pointed at the ring on the hilt and answered faintly. "This ring was used by the old Deken heads to pull up the black star. Although it is absolutely impossible to suppress the power of the black star, but from its ability to guide and suppress the power of the hilt, it does not mean It took a lot of hard work from the old man for more than a decade... If I really let him go to love Einst and get the leaves of the world tree, maybe..." Aier’s mother coughed gently Two times, it seems that the subconscious mind caressed his chest. Asa knows that she has chest pain in every special cold weather, which seems to be the old trouble left many years ago. "That guy is not the first master of the mainland at that time....<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘿嘿, it’s never been...."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa opened his mouth and wanted to ask but did not ask. He is not very willing to inquire about these adult things just for curiosity. He learned from Sander, these old people who have too many stories can naturally say to you, not willing to say you. It is useless to ask again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Shandrona git has really given me a problem, why he doesn't find a good place to collect this.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now finally wants to return to the detached thing that the Necromancer should have, but finally pushes me out. Oh, forget it, I will finally give you a direction." Her mother-in-law smiled bitterly and bowed her head and meditated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half a sigh, she looked up and sighed, or looked at Asa with a smile on her face. "Send it to Nigan. I know that there is a guy who will be very I am happy to accept this thing. As long as you can really give it to him, then probably everything will be temporarily closed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nigan" underground? Asa was amazed. He didn't really think that Aier's mother would give him a place like this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lonnis and Sander People have been guarding together for 20 years, and they have been destroyed by people. Do you think that someone on this continent can really guard this thing? This thing is inherently dangerous, but the most dangerous thing is the greed and ambition it causes. Only in that place is probably where human ambition and greed cannot reach. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really.... All things can be done?" "Asa sighed, if it was true. This long journey can finally have a clear destination.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
