			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a timber farmer walked into his boss’s room, he was almost scared to sit on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a person who is not like a person lying on the ground. Even arthropods do not have such distorted limbs as they are the branches of the limbs that look more like trees. The bones on the face of this person are also completely broken. It seems that the face is as tight as a pile of rubbish. The strange appearance of the original face has been unrecognizable. The middle part of the mouth is only a large blood hole. The dozens of teeth on the ground are knocked down one by one from the inside. The two small dots on the top of the hole are hung under the blood hole. The eyeballs of the eyelids kept some of the meridians behind and the one next to them was torn off the ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this person is still not still dead and still shaking slightly. Although his body and appearance are completely deformed, he is probably seen from his black skin and lean muscles. He is a small worker who has just been alive and kicking. It was only a few minutes before he was called in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis is impatient, he has to admit that these people’s bones are still tough. Of course, he still has a lot of tricks to use. He wants to know if there are any means for the bones to be able to beat him. Except for the Duke of Mulak and his master, Lord Roland, his favorite favorite is the interrogator. He even knows how to cut people one by one until the person can see his internal organs and most of the bones alive. But now there is no doubt that there is no time to show these tricks and you must ask for useful things as soon as possible. His voice sounds like a demon stone statue cursing: Does this person have any family members? Wife, parents, children, what, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a villager in a local village. There are several villagers who work with us in the same village. They live together and they still live together. There are a few children, the timber field owners squashed in the corner of the stuttering answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children? Crowes showed a corpse-like smile. Bring them all to me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timber field owner ran away like an escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not a human hunter, Levin struggles to spit out a few words with the mouth of the bloody hole. The eyeballs hanging out of the eyelids are also looked at with the venom of the body. Clause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis seems to be very satisfied with this description, he is very confident and confidently laughed. I haven’t heard of this person since he’s been forced to ask. Now it’s finally open. This is the curse of vain and the evidence that the other’s mind is desperate. He frowned with contempt: I purposely kept your tongue because I knew you would say it. You are stupid and awkward inferior animals. The final result is the same anyway. I don't know what you are so embarrassing to support. He rarely said a compassionate tone of alms. Say, you can still hear it now and tell me to tell me everything I want to know in detail. I know that you don't want to hear the crying voices of those little children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt and Asa came to the city with a large team of people. In this case, there is nothing to say and forcefully take people away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not understand why Rod Hart was so cautious. Can they not deal with one Clause by the two of them? Even if he is indeed a disciple of the head of Roland, but how narrow is the man who is narrow-minded but only a dog of the Duke? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also believes that Rod Hart’s judgment should be better than his own. Since he decided this way, it means that it is more secure to go back and bring troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now listening to the neat pace of the five hundred heavy infantry behind them, Asa finally realized that this is the benefit of power. Although I think that at least 80% of the two people have a crush on Crows and then take people away, but now these 500 heavy infantry have at least 80% confidence. Ten more Clauses have to get through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when I first entered the city gate, I saw the bitter melon local official coming face to face with a bitter gourd face and said with a smile: "The two adults are really going back to the barracks. The lower official has been waiting here for a long time. It is such a boss of the lumber farm just the captain of the son-in-law of the Duke of the Elni family of the Elni family...." He seems to feel these noble The title is a list that all ignores. "He sent people to say that he caught a group of two people who were wanted to commit crimes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa and Rodhart are all looking at their faces. changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhart’s face was sighed and sighed at the bitter melon local official and said, “You will come first, we will follow.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local Officer Rodehart turned and turned to the leader of the team to order him to bring the five hundred infantry back to the barracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? We can still force people to take away." Asa asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Useless." Rodhart whispered. "Forcing those who have fallen into their own hands in the presence of all officials in the region? Even though we are the imperial ministers who have such power, they have left so many witnesses. By the means of the Duke of Mulak, we did this and found no death. The difference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa understands. In this case, even Bishop Ronis can't cover the past with what he has done. This is the king of the law is the king of politics is the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was too small to see Clovis. It was always because he was only the assistant of the Duke and didn't care too much about him. He forgot a little if there was no excellence. How can the Duke of Ability and Mind make him a deputy? You see that in such a short time, he can ask those things from the hunter's mouth and find out that the two of us must go back and bring troops to force Grasping people and immediately deliberately making things difficult for us to start. His mind and judgment are absolutely top-notch. This person is definitely not good to deal with." Rodhart’s face finally calmed down and all emotions were collected. The kindness of the eyes made a firm luster. "Now I only see the walking steps. Let's go and see what he wants to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wide hall in the main house of the lumber farm is not a humanoid The text slammed on the ground like a lizard that had been trampled over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone is this untouchable." Clavis pointed to the captives on the ground as if he were showing his great spoils. "It is he and other accomplices who have fallen into the two imprisoned adults. Actually, they were the wanted criminals who killed the local officials and imperial ministers in Erie six months ago. Everyone said that they should not fight?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be." Other officials said that there are also many voices that are out of shape. The officials in these small places have also seen the means of appreciating the officials of Wang Du for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa took a lot of effort to hold back and didn’t rush to punch Klauvis’s smug face Scrutinize Rod Hart. Even if you can do nothing, but Rod Hart is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis’ eyes kept staring at Asa and leaned over to Levin’s ear, saying in a butcher’s hunter’s voice: “Okay. Now let's talk to the adults here once again. I remind you that you must tell me what you said just now, you know what the consequences will be." He is very confident and very gentle. Say. "I know that you will not talk nonsense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About six months ago, the hunter Levin struggled to open a bloody mouth, just a bloody eye. Rodehart, who couldn't see him, said with a sound that didn't have teeth. "Rodhardt, who studied in Elazia, came back to be our folks and we were kidnapped because of poverty." He used the sound of bloody smell and dying voice to intermittently say the situation at the time. Come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sound in the hall. Every official heard it clearly that they knew everything about the time. From some angles and details, this is not a ridiculous and completely devoid of fall. Officials can't tell who they want to listen to. What do they mean is that they have a chic and quirky atmosphere. It seems that even the air has solidified in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunter Levin is undoubtedly already hurt to the limit. These words have already exhausted his remaining physical strength and only have gas in his nose. Asa finally couldn't help but go forward and help him simply deal with those serious injuries that were used to treat spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is clearly in the fall." Clavis looked at the face of the Asa discourse, all the joy of the winner. "Everyone can see how even a morally noble sect of a sect who is framing his own beggars can be a criminal. With this noble character, you can judge the authenticity of the matter. Yes. Adult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, yes, it must be a nonsense." The officials who found the steps quickly nodded and said yes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
