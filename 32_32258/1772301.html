			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand that you must understand that I understand." The Marquis sounded a bit awkward. But the tone of voice is also very serious, careful. The meaning of this is very clear. In particular, both parties are well aware of the situation. The situation is indeed different now. Escuel, the death of the Tamik Knights, means that there are not many people around the Pope, and the black-skinned hilt is born again. At this time, calculating suspicions with each other is just a waste of time and effort. The Pope said this in a separate conversation, and the meaning has been expressed very clearly. For everyone who is a complex and deep-minded person, what kind of covenant negotiation is nonsense. Can attract everyone to come together. The only thing is the common goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay. You understand." The Pope smiled and nodded. In this case, there is no question of trust and untrustworthiness. Together, the common interests of the common goal are always the most solid relationship. Since the other party has stated his position, the Pope can be sure that this is already a reliable ally. "You are not ambitious about power. And I am already paralyzed about power.....or, I have already gained power. From Deken’s body, I know a person’s The ambitions can't be too big, otherwise they can only be swallowed by themselves." The Pope touched the arm of his large chair and smiled. "So I am already satisfied with my position now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His holy sacred, deep and clear way." Marquis. It is not difficult to sit on a high position. It is difficult to know where to stop. There are also many examples of continually ascending and falling to the ground. It will never be less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I also know about Akibad’s prophecy. I didn’t care too much at first. But Oufu’s establishment, and this recent incident. It makes me a little confused. But no matter what happens, at least I won't let the world change." The Pope still sat in the chair, and his expression did not change. But the voice is no longer that peace and lightness. His eyes are not sharp and dignified, not as good as the mountains, or as the most powerful old man on the mainland. "It’s the orc city-state, or the legendary king of the dead spirit. Don’t think about changing this continent from my hands. It’s not just my will. It’s also the will of countless believers on this continent.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, we may wish to communicate well. I know that you must know a lot of news that I don't know, maybe something that I can't do." Things may not be of use when you are in your hands. But we all discuss it. But it is not impossible to use it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Thanks to his sire and love, I must know everything." The Marquis nodded, no hesitation. It is impossible for someone outside the pope's study to be able to overhear any conversation, but the pope summoned the new cardinal into the study by Hamm and secretly negotiated an afternoon but it is not difficult to know. So one day later, the news has reached the hands of Cedros. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message is still sent from the domesticated dragonfly. This method of delivery has been the speed limit in addition to transmitting magic. After seeing this letter from Celeste in the main hall of the city, Sedros browed a knot at the boss. After a long while, he found a clear scorpion. The commander said: "Tell the Bolugan adults to capture The domesticated bulls are placed in the first place in advance, and the rest can be slowed down. En..... Also, let Bolugan temporarily take over the position of the city owner. I have to go out for a trip."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The depths of the clear swamp are no longer the wild calm of the past. A boulevard was inserted into the depths of the swamp from the edge of the wild land, and the outermost swamp has been transformed into a fertile land. Large, large crops grow here. In addition to the power of the Oufudi and the other orcs, no one else can make such a daunting project in this sinister place that was originally a restricted area. After the transformation of the Elf Magic, the plant growth can not only adapt to the soil of the swamp, but also grow fast, and large berry and tuber can be produced in almost one month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these pieces and berries are not for the orcs, and now the food of the orcs is already the fine grains and meat produced on the highlands. Everything here is for raising bulls. The Wyvern has already lost almost the last battle with the church coalition. It seems unlikely that it will be added in a short period of time, so the focus of domestication has now been on the capture and domestication of the bull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road has almost extended into the deepest part of the swamp. The trees here are getting denser and denser, the helium in the swamp is getting heavier and heavier, and the environment is getting more and more bad. If it weren't for the Euphor's sorcerer, there would be a swampy sorcerer who would have lived here. Even if there is more manpower and material resources, it is impossible to get so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
