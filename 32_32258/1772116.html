			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the believers of the god of nature are there to stunned and watched the wood giants coming out of the god of nature watching the old man floating in the air looking at the station It slowly moved the guardian statue and looked at everything that was born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of ​​a fixed mind in the minds of the believers is completely incapable of giving all reasonable explanations to the students before them. magic? The miracle of the god of nature? Is the miracle the wood giant or the guardian statue? Their brains were all messed up and they didn't understand what it was all about and what they should do. Just stupidly standing there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone is running. Run." Only one person shouted screaming but was not enough to wake up thousands of people on the broad and crowded grass. A dizzy person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All retreats will be retired back to Airy." Asa yelled at the remaining soldiers. The soldiers who had not left much were busy with the opportunity of the believers to run out of the grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa turned and opened his hand at a gargoyle. In the current situation, only one can be destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But suddenly the body seemed to be pumped by a huge whip. The muscles and nerves of the whole body were both numb and numb. When a black plant fell to the ground, he heard the snoring of his head faintly smelling the smell of his body. The last thought that blurted in my mind was: too much.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Asa has been paying attention to the Necromancer in midair but not Thinking of this attack is so fast. He forgot that even the top air magic of flying can be lifted quickly. Lightweight such as 霹雳 lightning and other medium magic is naturally more comfortable than spit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer in the air looked at this nasty scammer and fell down in his own electric shock and finally laughed. His ordinary face was so horrible because of this smile. He ignored the following people's eyes and looked at the gargoyles who were acting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gargoyle’s movements are still slow but not as hard as they were. Including those bodies that have been cracked, they walked toward the nearest believer and stretched out their hands and held up their hands as if the children had picked up their beloved toys. The believers still have no clear mind to understand what is going on and let the guardian god lift themselves up. The gargoyle opened the mouth of the believers who had the big mouth of the bath and sent a bite inside. Screaming and screaming under the bite of the gargoyle's sharp teeth only opened the head and fell into the gargoyle's throat with the sound of limb deformation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only awakening of the believers that thousands of people rushed to scream at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just thousands of people on the grass and other places around the whisper. Tens of thousands of people at the same time have crossed the entire sky of Airy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood and flesh of the believers slipped into the gargoyle's body as if it were the best honey for the hungry and emptied person. The nourishment of the nutritional products of the gargoyles is much more flexible immediately. They grabbed the believers everywhere and sent them to their mouths. The more they eat, the more they have the spirit, the more they eat, the more energetic, like a giant bloody giant civet cat, jumping wildly and madly swallowing these automatic deliveries to the feet. food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of believers screamed in horror and ran away. Many people stood unsteady and were pushed down by others. They continued to step on their bodies and escaped. People screamed and screamed and grabbed their feet. So more people fell behind. More people stepped on the higher and higher comrades' bodies and continued to run, just to escape from this terrible place as soon as possible. The people who ran wildly on the grass were like a pile of crowded cockroaches rushing to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After every gargoyle has swallowed a dozen people, blood will flow out of his mouth as the body sways. It seems that the body is not loaded with food. The flesh and blood of the space have already overflowed into the throat. At this time, they all look like the spirits of the body. They are all agile and soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer floating in the air landed him as if he was not satisfied with the spells of the gargoyles who raised their hands and sang the song that seemed to be a tune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gargoyle did not move and trembled and then squirted the black mud from the mouth of a big beach It came out that the flesh and blood of the person who had just eaten went in and filtered it and it became something like the mud in the gutter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believers full of grass have been completely mad in fear. Even the desperate escape seems to be a futile stone ghost. As long as a jump or gliding, you can easily catch one or two screams. There is no broken body and blood flowing out. These huge extravagant blood bats keep throwing away. The deformed limbs in the hands rushed to another lively jump. Blood and limbs are already the only shades of screams and wailing here. The melody of this once devout holy grass is now an unprecedented slaughterhouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than just outside the grass, there are more than a hundred gargoyles around the whisper of Sen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are finally gargoyles who are no longer chasing after eating the blood in their bodies and have begun to overflow. The Necromancer flew up to the head of a gargoyle, and the ghosts of the singer screamed in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the grass, the fugitives have escaped far away, leaving only a half-dead companion in the ground to soak in the broken limbs and internal organs. Half-dead in the ocean is not alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other direction of the whispering of the singer also flew up the gargoyle and gathered here to fly up and then hovered over the whispering outside of the formation of the whisper A circle. The gargoyle's circle constantly rises to a higher and higher height until it looks like just a hundred oddly shaped birds from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer who flew up from the gargoyle on the other side sighed at his companion: "I don’t think that the elves actually sent the dead wood guards out. Let our plan be defeated. But as long as we fly up, it should be fine." He looked at the gargoyles around his companions and there were cracks in them. "Does the damage on your side seem to be more serious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man is cold and cold: "A human kid is messing up. It seems that the elves have been stealing all night. The kid of the world tree leaf should be the old man of Ronis who came here to solve the pagan boy. And it should be his eavesdropping last night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Is it him?" This necromancer is a bit surprised. "Have you played against him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" killed." The old man's voice is cold and brief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer stunned and thought about not talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man looked down and looked at the whispering Forest below. A scarlet forest outlined the outline of the forest. He nodded with satisfaction. "This height should be appropriate. Let's get started." He raised his hands and read the spells of all the gargoyles while opening the blood drawn from the bodies of thousands of people from their mouths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood did not fall but all turned into a fog in the air. This blood fog seems to be solidified and solidified. In the circle surrounded by the gargoyles, even in the strong winds of the high sky, it is impossible to blow away. So the high altitude above the whispering sire becomes a whisper Blood cover. The bloody smell that the wind took away can be smelled within a hundred miles of the entire Airy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this bloody smell is simply insignificant compared to the grass. The stinking smell of the squirrels spit out of the scent of the squid, and the corpses and the visceral worms are still smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure suddenly appeared in the shadow of the old tree and then came out of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver armor of the beautiful face of the insects made the armor and the clothes are rough but not able to hide the perfect body. Such a purely natural beauty to the extreme of the girl actually appeared in such a fleshy and fuzzy hell on the grass looks grotesque. It is a pity that the believers who are still alive on the ground are desperately trying to use all the remaining power to move their bodies outside and not even dare to go back and never see her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked up and saw the bloody clouds and the gargoyles hovering in a circle and looking down on the grass outside, even more infinitely horrified. Suddenly she was on the ground and the blackened Asa quickly came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She whispered in front of Asa and muttered in a language that no one could understand, and gave birth to a green light on her hands and pressed it on Asa. . The green light covered Asa and he vomited a long breath and woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I just woke up was that Luya Asa was very surprised and asked: "How is it? How can you come out? What are the dead wood guards? "The moment he was attacked, he converted all the magical power to be used as a fireball into a treatment. He finally saved his life but the huge electric shock still killed him half." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked up and saw the blood-red light curtain in the sky patted her shoulder and said, "Don't be sad. Maybe it's not a bad thing. We should look like we should leave now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man of the Necromancer in the sky commanded the gargoyles to spit out the blood and said to his companions: "The next step is to rely on you so complicated magic array. You are only in the crystal ball. Can you really remember it after reading it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please rest assured that there are absolutely no problems with the help of so many devout believers." His companions were faint A smile sat on the head of a gargoyle against the bloody fog. "Okay, let's start our great achievements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood fog in the circle begins to slowly condense in the air and gradually surrounds the gargoyle. The circle outlines a magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is what they are prepared to use to deal with our forest?" Luya looked at the bloody fog and looked disdain. "It’s useless, no matter what the power of the magical array, there is absolutely no way to break through the power of the Sunwell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. That is" Asa looked at him in amazement That magical array seems to have seen it there. The circular space in the middle of the sky with the formation of the magical array in the middle of the gargoyle is completely dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did they darken them and block the sun?" Luya wrinkled the slender eyebrows and disdain. "It’s useless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not to cover them." Asa finally remembered what it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of a silver light curtain tilted down to the whisper of the funnel to the dazzling funnel tip just fell into the whispering forest. No explosions or ruptures of any magic are as quiet as the forest's usual style. The pillars of the sky are quiet and vacant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this? Impossible is absolutely impossible." Lucia was surprised to add. "Any magic power can't penetrate the barrier of the sunwell to reach the forest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's not magical magical force only stay in that circle, they are used The air magic twists the sun and falls into the whisper of the whisper only by the heat of the light." Asa slowly shook his head. "The whispering is over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Asa does not understand why the magical array of Cedros is learned by these two necromancers to attack whispers. Mori. But this is indeed the only and wonderful way to attack through the solar well enchantment. And this magical array can't be destroyed by anyone in any way at hundreds of meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heat wave is blowing in the grass, even in such a long distance, you can feel the fierceness of the flames in the whisper. The focus of the concentrating light is constantly moving under the control of the Necromancer. The ancient tree and the dead wood guard instantly lose moisture in the violent light and then burn and then bake the trees next to them to be ignited by the light or burned directly. The sea of ​​whispers in the middle of the whisper of the sea under the movement of the light curtain to expand more dead wood guards and elves and unicorns have no way to prevent such attacks can only wait in vain on the ground in the dazzling sky Death came to his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luya ran to the whispering forest but was dragged by Asa. "What are you doing? Go in and wait to be scorched together? Let's go. There is no room for us to intervene."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black-skinned animal screams All the way stumbled to the edge of the forest. The exterior has turned into a dark carbon. Only the corner on the head makes it possible to distinguish that the animal should have been a pure white holy unicorn. The animal, which had been completely baked and not shaped, fell to the edge of the forest and struggled to scream and died completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luya slammed his hand and broke away from Asa’s whispering squad, running to the slender and agile figure, just a few steps into the smog In the bushes. Asa stunned instinctively and wanted to start chasing but stood still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hesitantly he suddenly remembered the first encounter with the little cockroach in the lizard swamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An inexplicable impulse to stir in the heart with a sorrow that should never appear at this time. He looked up at the sky and the light curtain under the bloody magical array seemed to have a sacred taste. He thought about it and sighed and rushed into the whispering forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
