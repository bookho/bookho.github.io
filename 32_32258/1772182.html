			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A battle of more than 10,000 people for more than a dozen people should generally not be called a battle. It should be said to be a massacre. This battle is no exception. It is indeed a massacre. However, it was the 4,000 people who were killed by the more than a dozen mixed sub-humans and two human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four thousand people, although temporarily integrated as a miscellaneous force, do not in any way represent a vulnerable item. Actually they are even farther than the regular troops of Erasia. More combative. The escorts of the various sub-districts of the Erasia Church have been retired from the Celestry. The old Templars are trained as instructors and many of the soldiers are selected from the templars. Regardless of whether the election is only qualified to participate in the selection of Celeste, it is proof of strength. And there are a large number of magicians and priests. The strength of the controllers who are often honed in the battle with Nigan and Tatlaria is by no means the same as the magicians in the adventure team. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a certain point of view, this unit is absolutely unquestionable except for the fact that the number of people is isolated from the wilderness. But such an elite but being slaughtered has no power to fight back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is nearing the end. More than 300 of the most elite warriors are guarding the central Five senior magicians and a dozen pastors looked at the approaching enemy with an angry fight in despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three whole bodies are heavy armor. Like the steel barriers, the ogre is breathing out from the all-steel mask of the blood. With a strong bloody smell, they are already tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is almost three huge killing machines. There is a whole-sized mace in their hands that is the gear of the ground meat, even if it is to prevent the heavy cavalry from charging. Shields are also vulnerable under this weapon, not to mention the human body. And the heavy armor that is difficult to get into the knife and gun makes the vast majority of the offensive ineffective. The key is that there is a magical array that has been attacked by each ogres for several magic attacks. The magic material embedded in the armor is enough to equip a magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four werewolves did not have such exaggerated equipment, so two of them were still injured. There are not many people who kill them, but they are all elites in this army. Those who could have used their skills and experience to deal with the ogres who are delaying the ogre are the ones who are dead in their hands. They are not just physically talented, but they are not weaker than those who have fought. One that is even used is not a chain-like meteor hammer, which is a deadly weapon. It is two steel swords that are absolutely technical and technical. Werewolf talent is more agile than humans and even similar to elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lizard people use three huge long knives, four of which use the extremely high precision and strength of the chain. Only a small craftsman can make their responsibility is to cope with and assist those huge killing machines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than 3,000 church warriors who are now dripping with blood everywhere in the body. Let these sub-humans look like demons who have just climbed out of the blood pool hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now these demons are not clawed. There is no roaring roar. It is like a group of well-trained soldiers. None of the church warriors’ eyes are focused on them. These monsters are not even tall and terrible because there is another person in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A seemingly standard human being is slightly thin and somewhat pale. Ginger's body contours and muscle curves are more complete than the most perfect sculptures. Because the stone is no longer carved, there is no such violent but static and still life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all the remaining fighters are watching this person. The black scorpions let everyone watching them clearly and clearly, as if there is an endless black ocean, they will swallow up all the people here and there will be no waves. This person is the only exception here. Although he is standing in the blood of the corpse, there is no trace of blood on his body. There is only one layer of <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;light white radiance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this hellish Shura field he seems to be a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man sighed and the white light dissipated the rocky face and showed some tiredness. He is not really a god after all. Still a living person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemies are usually just a modified concept. No one really makes enough of the enemy. What's more, the soldiers here are all elite. No matter who kills nearly a thousand of such opponents, they will never be tired even if they don't die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors looked at the man's magician and pastor on the ground while looking at another human. But he was not on the ground but on a Wyvern in midair. The soldiers look at the man's eyes are fear and anger. The magicians look at this person's eyes but they are also admirable in the hostility and anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wyvern is a short silver man with a wand and a brilliant eye. He is the only one on the orc who will use magic but he adds a wand to him and he is dealing with hundreds of magicians and priests below. They had to spend almost all their strength to deal with themselves and could not separate their hands to deal with the orcs and the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old man is not using earth-shattering magic or curse except for the atmosphere around him and the Wyatt. All are low-middle magic. But the key to his use of the law is that the creativity and imagination of using spells is like a magical demonstration of magical performances. A variety of magic emerged from his hands. The four elements of the dark system and even the white magic combined with each other and the attack of the following magicians hit the same group of magic fireworks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No attack can successfully deal with this high-ranking mage. He usually has at least one instant magic to steal the magic of three or four opponents at least because of a collision or explosion. A senior magician even used a volcanic scroll of the fire, but the old man was just two fireballs and then an air magical wind control immediately changed the hot ball to change the trajectory and fly back. The ground. At least thirty fighters have turned coke under this top reel. And the thunder bomb that flew out of his magic wand, which was made from the horn of the unicorn, made it difficult for the following mages to defend.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The huge explosions and turbulences constantly smashed a piece of death flower in the crowd. And his own hands-on attack is even more tricky, such as the use of black magic corrosive venom to burst the ice of the water system in the air and hit each other in the ice fragments all contaminated with the toxicity of the black magic of the bones and carrion. Or use a high-heat fireball to blow out the gas from the ball of the venom of the water system under the pressure of the wind control. Another time was to collide with several water magicians to drop the ice particles of the sky. Then a thunder bomb exploded. The last soil decomposing technique caught up with the thunderball. In the end, hundreds of people in that small area are wailing in the electric light. If they can go back from here, the fighting power of the only remaining magicians will rise. At a certain stage, they have already seen the art of the law. /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give you a chance to surrender. We guarantee your safety. "The face of the man who dissipated the vindictiveness showed a trace of anxiety. "We have already yelled at you all the time to call you out of the highlands." This battle is what you are looking for. The outcome has been decided to surrender. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young soldier in the surviving city's team looks at the man's red eyes and is full of blood. He whispers: "He seems to be very tired." It is. We can pretend to surrender... There are so many people here, after all, a few magicians can do it all..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Useless. That is Cedros and Gru. The two masters of the city of Oufu. I am afraid that only Lancelot and the Knights of the Temple will be their opponents. "The fifteen-six-year-old veteran shook his head but his face was not disappointing and stunned. However, he was resolute and determined. He used to be the commander of the sect of Celeste. He is now the commander of this team. "The key thing is that we don't It is not our own interests to be able to surrender what we fight for. It is the glory and glory of the Lord. For the glory of the Lord, we must not surrender even if it is pretending. "The young warrior suddenly bowed his head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the glory of the Lord, let us sing our blood and courage here." "The voice of the old Templar was hoarse and passed to every ear. All the expressions of the people were alive. The magicians began to sing the spells and the warriors clenched their weapons.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;" I hated this sentence a long time ago. Delay my time. Grugio sighed and heard the message from the other side for a while. He took a deep breath and re-emerged the vindictive light.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you want to do in the past? "The five lions in the sky are not far from the five lions hovering in the air. One of the priests drove the lions to stop the companions who wanted to rush to the battlefield.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I have two burning clouds, a star flying and a chain of lightning bolts. I can't watch them being killed by the pagans and orc devils. "The young magician on the back of the lion cries. The fight on the battlefield is over and the rest of the battle is more fierce and cruel than the previous one.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
