			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The elf is unlikely to control the fire attack so well. These two should be the human kid you just said. He doesn't seem to die." The mage said to his companion. He recruited the bloody fog that was beckoned by the blast of the explosion and immediately re-solidified the magical array and restored the original shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really not dead?" The old man's necromancer looked at the ground with some dim old eyes but the height was so small. "Just give him a thunder bomb." He sat on a gargoyle's neck and stone like a ghost, and fluttered away from the circle. "I will go down and protect you. You will continue to manipulate it and burn the whispering sorrow. By the way, you will kill the inconvenient kid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer who manipulates the magic array Looking down at the people who are just the little black spots, I thought about it and I sighed as if I decided to nod. Said to himself: "Well, kill him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light curtain immediately returned to the original position. Many of the elves in the aperture only had time to scream and scream for a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa dragged Luya out and just stood up again and immediately saw the dazzling light rushing towards them. He forced the Luya to push himself out and jumped out to the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that there’s a high temperature away from the focus of the aperture that has burned Asa’s head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just tumbling a few turns from the ground and standing up, I saw that the glare of the past swayed and seemed to move towards him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is both scared and afraid. I didn’t burn him directly because he was flashing fast but the Necromancer himself did not control well. Dodging under such an attack is almost meaningless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dazzling focus shimmers as if a living sun is dancing on the dark scorched earth. It is not a simple matter to accurately focus on a target. The Necromancer is trying to control it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magical array of thousands of flesh-and-blood essences is not comparable to the time that Cedros was cast in the wild highlands, although the sun here is not high. The ground is so fierce, but the circles surrounded by the gargoyles are so whispered that the light that converges is so much more than ten times more. Just look at the eyes where the eyes are shining. The eyes can’t stand it anymore, even if you don’t die. It will also be awkward <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was just a remedy for this problem. Asa looked up and saw the circle surrounded by the gargoyle still in the rotation should be this circle to maintain the magic array in the air does not scatter to attack here is the root. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A huge fireball that can no longer be called a 'ball' is a gargoyle that rises from the ground and flies into the air. Such a high level of magical power that does not resonate with the high level of magical power has fully expressed the violent energy contained therein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gargoyle who had left the circle team came to the fireball. The old man who was sitting above, the necromancer just waved the wave of the fireball in an understatement, and immediately turned off the stone ghost to fly to the sky and become smaller and smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little sun on the ground is moving far away from the body and passing Asa screams, he can feel the whole body's skin seems to be burnt The red knife cut a bit. The smell of his smell in the air is even stronger because it is the smell of his own skin. However, he did not move the opponent's attack and was completely incapable of moving the crosshairs and perhaps being more easily photographed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's stay away from here." Asa snarled toward Luya not far away. She was vainly searching for the survivors in the dark bodies of the elves, a silver and a face full of black ash and tears that had already smeared her beautiful face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after she heard Asa’s screaming, she not only did not leave but went a few steps to recite the Elvish. The pain of a green light gently rubbing his body on Asa immediately began to ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa took a deep breath and was able to hold his lungs steamed with his left hand in his right wrist. ‘Bang’, he was shocked by the dusty recoil of his own magical recoil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is still the lowest level of fireball but there is no fireball at least not a fireball. Only a dark red shadow blinked from the ground to the underside of the gargoyle that the Necromancer was riding. He did not aim at the circle of gargoyles must first solve this defense-defending opponent first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aperture was shaking on the ground again. This time it was farther away from Asa. It seems that manipulating this is not a simple matter, but Asa did not feel lucky but felt cold. It was indeed his full strength just now, but the necromancer did not work hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is doing everything he can, but the intercepting Necromancer does not face his magic at all. Controlling the wind pressure is a small magic. For the magical power of the top magician such as the Necromancer, it is only a sneak peek or even the magical power between the breaths can be restored. Even if he wants to rely on the magical supplement of the Sunwell and the other party to consume magic, it is just a delusion. Moreover, he did not have this time at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Escape, he suddenly thought. In the face of hundreds of meters of high-altitude can not dodge the attack a magic level and their opponents far from the world to defend against this how to fight? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, you can't escape. Escape can not escape the above-mentioned Necromancer as long as the direction of the aperture is changed, the focus on the ground is a thousand miles. And if it shows that the direction of escape is more likely to be taken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa forcibly concentrated the three fireballs in three directions to three gargoyles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer in the sky shook his head and was disappointed with the three companies that even the senior magician could not do. His hands waved three with a dance-like movement. The fireball immediately turned out in three directions as if it were a very obedient animal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little sun that represents death and destruction flickers on the ground and jumps more intensely. The Necromancer who controls the air magic array continues to debug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Run." Asa shouted to Luya. "We ran separately." He finally despaired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luya is still there, Asa rushes up and throws her up and throws it out. Then turned around and ran in the opposite direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no rush to step out of Asa’s eyes and it was a flash of light. The whole world was completely replaced by this incomparable light. In the last glance he could see, he saw all the light in the range of dozens of meters around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer who manipulates the light has no time to study how to capture his figure with a focus of five or six meters in diameter, but directly expands the focus to nearly one hundred Rice directly enveloped him in the focus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expanding the focus means dispersing the light to dissipate the heat but this is enough. The difference between the light in two or three squares in the radius of five or six meters and the one hundred meters in the human body is not the same as that of drying any other things that are hydrated, but it is only a few seconds from the moment. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s eyes are already dark after I feel excessively bright. He reaches for it, but it’s just a pain that doesn’t let it burst. However, the nerves that only lasted for a few seconds were burnt, and they couldn’t feel anything. They seemed to be calling, but they didn’t hear that the throat was already burnt. The nose smelled from their own skin and muscles. smelly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the subconscious Asa stumbled toward the Sunwell. He didn't know anything. He only knew that even his own body was flowing in the fire veins. The magma viscera would immediately blast like a firecracker. He only knows that there is water there and he wants water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried his best to control the almost burnt muscles and rushed to the Sunwell and carried them in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The necromancer who controlled the air magic array in the air saw Asa put the sun well into the sun well and immediately narrowed the focus of the light to the position of the sunwell. From the time when the elves were burned, it is always easier to focus on the sun wells than to focus on other places. He simply focused his attention again on the sun well that was less than three or four meters. He not only burned the target to burnt ash, but also used the light to steam the sun well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge funnel light curtain in the shadows now casts the sun that originally shines through the whisper of the whisper to the sun well. There is already a rock that is swaying along the well. Reflecting the dazzling light is like the real sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer looked and nodded with satisfaction at his height that was dazzling. Nothing can stop such an attack. Even if there is a river there is only a dry and a steel cast fortress that only melts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
