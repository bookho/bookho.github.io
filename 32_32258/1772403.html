I thought it was still in the morgue of the Magic Academy. A little boy who doesn’t understand anything.” Shan Delu looked at Asa and sighed. This old man who has been more emotional than anyone else can be more intense than the youngest young man. This time finally shows up. The tired face. The old is actually piled up with countless helplessness. "I haven't been able to do anything for you in the past few years. I have been forced to help you until I have been forced into a desperate situation. I know you have no need. I am really embarrassed-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa shook his head and smiled: "Where I actually lived to this time, I lost all of you and I have a lot of things that you have given me. I have always thanked you~" —”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I don’t owe you too much.” Shandre shook his head and interrupted Asa’s words. Although the voice was very tired, he was sure that his face was all kind. Helpless fall. "It’s been a long time ago. In fact, Magnus’s mixed ball is so good that it’s actually caused by me. I’m actually making this. I’ve been working for me more than 20 years ago. There are also escapes in these 20 years, so I owe you a pity. Now I still can't get it when I want to return -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa also interrupted The words of Sandro. "Don't say this because it's useless. I thank you anyway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Sandro suddenly said: "At least you should Know what you should know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know? What should I know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sandru did not directly say that he thought about it first. Just ask? "What kind of person is your parents?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa faintly said: "My father was a blacksmith in the Karendo Basin. It’s dead. As for my mother, it seems that she did not have her in her memory. They are very ordinary people and all the ordinary people in Karendoli.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ordinary people? I don't tell you that your biological parents are not ordinary people." Sander slowly said that he was struggling every time he said a word. "Do you want to know who your biological parents are? How did you get abandoned by them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Don't want to." Asa replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Sandro is completely stunned. It seems that as long as people hear this question, the first reaction is to be shocked. He thought about it. Only wake up: "You already know your parents -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ayr's mother-in-law - I've already told me about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? She-what did she say to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She just told me yes She put me at my father's door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So she also tells you who your biological parents are?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. But I don't want to know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because it has nothing to do with me. Who is it and what is it for me? I still have something to do with what I should do?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru took a moment to think about it and then smiled and nodded: "There is no difference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa continues to say faintly: "My father is a very ordinary person. But it is great. He has a father like me. Thankfully more proud of one thing there is this enough to know what I need to go to those things and I completely unrelated to do "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;.? & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"Not in total, thank you for your kindness. But I am very busy now and don't want to know these boring things." Asa smiled and smiled. "If you have time, if you have a chance, talk again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a chance to be free again - but can you still have it? Is there still a chance? Sandru also only returned with a bitter smile. He looked up and looked at the sky for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge tree tops. The earth's vitality collapsed is already an irreparable desperate situation. It seems that the heavens and the earth are all the decline of this colorful and desperate death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Sander’s tired face on his face was not willing to wait for the expression to be replaced by peace and calmness. I thought about him and said, "This way, I will tell you something. This thing is actually not related to you, so you can listen with confidence. I am just afraid - one is in case and I am afraid that there will be no chance in the future. Tell this story to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you say it." Asa nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used to have a woman I know - well - it’s strange to say that you and her are a little bit similar. But that’s long It’s not so good to look at your man’s face, so I often call you a sissy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Think of it, I’ll just say it.” Asa smiled and patted him. As in the days when Wang Du and the two met, it was a short but peaceful day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, this woman’s mind is very smart, but it’s a pity that if a person doesn’t have enough mental and intelligent mind, it’s just a burden to be tired. And women’s minds have always been Not much at most, you just know that you look bigger from the shape. Hey." Sandro smiled very easily and was a little sneaky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, of course I know." Asa also laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When people are too clever, they look down on other people and even look down on the world. So this woman is constantly pursuing everything and pursuing everything. Try it. The woman is a very beautiful woman. The woman's restlessness is inherently troublesome because she can easily wrap other men together in trouble. All the troubles finally get together and finally make trouble. This woman is also dead--"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, the woman I know doesn't look like this." Asa shrugged. "Women's restlessness is more annoying than anything else. But a man who is involved in a woman is not a terrible man--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I have already said The biggest trouble for women is that people know that it is troublesome, but they still can't help but provoke this trouble." Shan De shook his head and sighed. "There was a son before this woman died. It seems that I heard that the two men who belonged to this woman were all special-identified guys. No one can count as a normal person and ignored his son. Finally, this baby was abandoned. I don’t know where to go to live or die. But before the woman died, she said that her son must be involved in this trouble in the future. She gave birth to the baby and came to continue the trouble. It’s funny that a group of old guys are suspicious--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s funny to true*." Asa’s response was just that he and Sander had no smile on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh yeah. If the baby is still alive, it must be very annoying to this woman and those who don’t know who his father is." At this point, Sandro’s face is not very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this baby male or female?" Asa suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru answered with one answer: "Men's."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh then it won't "Asa shook her head and said faintly." "Although this has nothing to do with me, I know that as a man, I will not blame anyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s hands faintly said: “Because blaming others doesn’t mean anything, it doesn’t change any reality. It’s just an excuse for escaping. So a real man won’t go. Blaming anyone will only focus on what they are going to do. And everyone has something to do with their own reasons, no matter what those people have nothing to do with him, there is no reason to blame. At most, if you are not pleasing to the eye, you will be jealous. Is it a blame for a meal or a knife?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
