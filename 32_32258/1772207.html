			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elastic muscle fat and the strength of the skin can be felt through the clothes. The touch on the skin is suddenly raised by this person. One feeling is actually a kind of swaying and then feared because of the cold feeling of the neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and saw the black and white face of a black face on the original beautiful and beautiful facial features because of the bloodthirsty impulse during hunting. Some of the slightly twisted tongues stick out of the mouth and slammed against the dark eyes of the lips, burning a cold and hot flame. The magical eye can even see the muscles and secretions in the body just because of this successful assassination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blue dagger penetrates from his neck and accurately cuts the carotid artery into two toxins on the sword to resemble the owner. The impulse of jq quickly dissolves into the blood to erode every body in every cell. Seia can clearly see how her body is gradually dying under the erosion of this toxin. Every step is so clear in the eyes of the magic god. He fears to scream but does not have any sound. Soon he has already Fear can't feel it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men fell off the black from the air and the woman drew a short sword and landed easily. *The teacher's neck spurted a small blue blood arrow like a rag pocket filled with dead meat, and fell on the ground. The huge magical eye immediately collapsed. The blue magic light disappeared and the eyeball became a pool of water. Scattered in the rain and disappeared without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stared at the black elf who had dropped the body of the division, and said: "Is it? How come you?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look back to see you die and die. It seems that your luck is good, but my better." Jessica suddenly smiled and she did not reveal such expression for a long time. "This time it seems that I saved you and finally owe you nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa took a sigh of relief. It is true that if the Seya master is flying to the height he can't attack, he can almost say a dead end. He couldn’t think of a helper who would have just killed Saia at this time and even thought that this helper was actually Jessica who had already returned to Oufu. But thinking about it immediately understands that it is reasonable to use Cedros to carefully store several Erasia transmission reels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica threw a delivery reel to Asa and said, "Hey, let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No. There is still one thing for the time being." Asa did not panic. It is only a matter of time before I have this thing in my hand. It took so much thought and energy to save the life of the Knights of the Temple. At the last minute, at the very least, it is necessary to ensure that this weapon against the animal Lasia and the church can function well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hooves and the light of the knights and churches in other areas are gathering here. The explosion just made it a hundred miles away. People are aware of it. Asara flew from Jessica to the place where she just started and asked, "What about other people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica shook his head and replied: "No one else. I came back alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it alone?" Asa stayed again. Only Jessica’s strength is not enough to be called a reinforcement in front of such masters as Oling and Seia. Her ability to kill the Seia master this time can only be said to be luck. Appear suddenly when it is appropriate at a very suitable place. This will focus all the attention on the death of the court magician of Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because there are only two transfer reels. The dwarf named Bolu says that only one can only use one person."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the name of Bolugan? It’s true that when Cedros’s good helper saved my life, I would also help Oufu save.” Asa smiled and shakes Shake his head. Knowing that the transfer reel is anywhere is quite difficult, but when I am hanging on the line, this friend is still thinking about losing a reel. This will feel uncomfortable anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the environment you left behind at the time, no one would think that you have the opportunity to escape from the shrine knight and so many guards and pastors. I thought you were dead and I was going to let the kid with white magic and his sister help you with the funeral. But the elf leader you know with me stopped me and he wanted me to come back to investigate. He said that even if you were The people of the church seized. They must not want to kill you. So you are not necessarily dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dwarf also said this, although he said that the possibility is not small. He also said that his friends are not many. But you are one. So although for the orc city-state, the Erasia transmission scroll is no The strategic treasure of price, but he still gave me a piece to let me come back to see if you are dead or not. If you are not dead, you may be able to help you. If you are caught by the church, I can bring the situation back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the style of this guy." Asa sighed. "Fortunately, your luck is good. My luck is also good. It can be just happened to you at this time or else it is not just that I can only die together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Jessica frowned at him and asked him with a strange tone: "Why do I also? If I am not sure, of course I will not come out to reveal whereabouts. I hope that you will not die but you are not interested in going to die with you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" Asa smiled a bit. "It's a bit of an accident, but it's really your style."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are all rushing and leaping over the building without bypassing The knights and guards on the road rushed to the location of the battle. Ou Ling seems to have not yet returned to here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa pulled a pile of masonry and rubble to see the horsewoman who had been buried underneath. When he went to chase the court magician just now, he had to put the Knights of the Temple into the wall under the turbulent waves, even if Ou Ling rushed back here. Without the power of Seia, it is impossible to show her in such a dark rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you come back specifically for this idiot knight?" Jessica frowned at him and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa pulled the horsewoman out and took a closer look at her body. The recovery magic of the last elf stored in the wristband was used up to answer: "Good. Living back to Celeste should be more useful to Oufu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black elf snorted and said: "I have nothing to do with the grungy orc castle. In contrast, I prefer to smear this little girl and hang it at the door of the Glorious Castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green magic light flashed over the female knight whispered I slowly woke up. The natural recovery of magic is far better than the white magic in terms of healing power. The powerful treatment of the radiant battle armor healed the wound on the neck of Talis. But she couldn't give birth to her massive blood, but her magical vitality could be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis opened her eyes and saw the two men in front of him with the faint light of the shining armor. She stared at Asa. It can be seen from the expression that her head has no way to connect the situation before the loss of consciousness with the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa first said: "Do you remember what you just did? Ou Ling wants to kill you is that I saved you from his hand."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you say that you will save me?" Talis struggled to stand up but the full effect of a healing spell only allowed her to stand up. In any case, she can't figure out that she would be saved by this person. But if someone didn't help her, she couldn't figure out why she could still live. She knows that the additional healing spells on her glorious armor can heal the deadly but devastating ** that is not a big wound. But since the person of Ou Ling has already started, he will never be sloppy enough not to cut her head to make sure she is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going to kill you now than killing a chicken. I can’t do it. I didn’t kill you. Isn’t that saving you?” Asa knew about Talibi. It’s just futile to have such a person’s confession and it’s never allowed to talk nonsense in the current situation. It’s natural to see her come to wake her up. "I don't want to talk too much about nonsense. I don't think you can understand why Abin's kid will be my helper to kill Eszal. Maybe you can't believe it, but I still tell you. Actually, that kills that in the wild. The mysterious white magician of a team of businessmen is Axel. He wants to kill the Abin with his mental magic. I am assassinating him but it is both his and her. The last is the Abin. Now you understand?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's impossible to talk nonsense. How can the Bishop of Aschard do the kind of thing?" Talis's expression was shaking because she could capture these seemingly totally unbelievable The true atmosphere of the words. She is not stupid or even a very intelligent person. Just over-belief usually covers the human mind. She vaguely judged these words to explain the truth of that scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response to the horsewoman Asa also expected. He continued to faintly said: "You can hardly believe these words. If I tell you that the Cardinal of Elazia is actually a member of the Deva Valley, it is even more difficult to believe if you want to come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
