			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pride seems to have some shortcomings. District Fu is big, and then magnificent, and there are some things that are not comparable to the small town of Bracada. The Bolugan adults immediately sighed with regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, what's wrong with you? Is there anything wrong with it?" The half-orc adjutant immediately noticed that it was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city's assistant also sighed and said: "There was a great man who once said: The eternal woman guides us forward. This sentence is not true, but also It's not unreasonable. Great achievements and achievements, great satisfaction, no beauty to share and appreciate. Life is really regrettable..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Indeed, Oufu is stronger and stronger, and the city of Cedros can see that he can make himself a higher position in Oufu, and his hands and feet can be re-opened. This is still the city of the orcs. There are very few human beings here, including the young people who are under the leadership of Cedrus. The Orc's eyes are admired again, and the Werewolf's guards are so powerful that they can't replace the hooligans of the Brakada Hostel who are eloquent and eloquent. In addition, I can share with myself the feelings of sharing these achievements and work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, sometimes I really admire that kid... Although I’m being chased everywhere, there are also girls who are smart and intelligent like the princess. . Oh, it’s already the prime minister of Ian Fast. Some time ago, I stayed at the King of Einfast and was too short. I was too tired. I didn’t have time to talk to the prime minister. It was the biggest regret of the year.....<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, the original adult you are troubled this, don't worry, don't worry." The half-orc adjutant immediately smiled very understandingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, do you have any good suggestions?" The eyes of Bolugan’s adults suddenly rose. He understands that although different races are male, some basic songs can cross ethnic boundaries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know a lot of beautiful, intelligent, understanding girls, you can tell the adults you know." The adjutant smiled mysteriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Girl?" The eyes of the Bolugan adults are bright again. Like a bonfire, he added a cup of oil, but he was a glimpse again. "Do you know beautiful girls? Is it your own family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The adjutant’s eyes were also bright, and Rong Guang was equally radiant. These resonances are indeed beyond any race. "Their skin can be green like the leaves of the water. The witness wants to take a bite at first sight. The outline of the face is as small as the bread from the human workshop. The two white teeth are thick and the body hair. Start with the most detailed brush, the muscles are also very good, the butt is as strong as the muscles of the Ogre Warrior, everyone<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on three or more walnuts, and the charming little cockroaches on the body..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." The eyes of Bolugan adults The bonfire that was splashed with a bucket of water was extinguished as soon as it was. He only felt that his body was also awkward. "It’s really a charming girl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." The adjutant felt like he had opened up hundreds of acres of new land and collected millions of pounds of food. I was as happy as I was, and I continued to report with the invitation. "I learned to have two friends of the werewolf. They also know a lot of werewolf girls. I heard that the fur can be beautiful like the snow on the Sandefes. There are also good girls in the ogre, the two breasts can be big enough. Can be used for..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough, enough." Bolugan repeatedly waved and stopped his continued report. Although the sun is shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he suddenly felt a burst of cold on the vest. It seems that even if there is indeed a resonance that transcends the racial boundaries, it is that the aesthetic point of view cannot be crossed. He didn't consciously understand and sighed, "How come there is no such feeling before, life is really lonely..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being depressed The assistant of the city master suddenly appeared in the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唉, yes, I heard that there are women among the mages who came here this time, and that the school is the tower master, maybe the old woman, but I took a look from a distance. It seems that it is not like an old woman... but it can be a woman who is the female leader of a group of old magicians. Is it too powerful...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Decision, I decided to visit the tower owner of the tower of the tooth." Long breathed a sigh of relief, and the great people of Bolugan felt that the world is so beautiful, the sun is so bright. When life is here, there is no regret even further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a trepidation and shook his head, and Bolugan suddenly stunned. He saw a crow on the tree not far away. It’s not uncommon to have a crow in the tree, but know that it’s a swamp. There is no such thing as a living space for crows. There is no other bird in the land of a giant monster like the Wyvern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Strange, how come crows here?" Bolugan whispered, curiously watching this Ukrainian that should not appear here. The crow on the tree looked at him with the same look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc adjutant also slaps his head and says, "Hey. Adults, you don’t say that I really didn’t think about it. It seems that there should be no crows here. But two days I I always saw this thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screaming land screamed, the crow seemed to understand that the two men did not welcome themselves, flying from the tree From the air, he swung in the air and flew deep into the swamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polugan adults looked at this little thing in a puzzled way. In the sun all over the sky, this little black dot seems to be a haze to the extreme, but it is real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celester, in the big secret room ordered by His Majesty the Pope, the new Cardinal is laughing, he has not laughed like this for a long time. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha, it’s such a funny place like Oufu, but it’s a bad guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis looked at the crystal ball in front of it, which reflected the unique scenery of the clear swamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only this crystal ball in front of him, there are dozens of identical crystal balls in this small chamber. The scenery inside each crystal ball is different, some are clear swamps, some are large wilderness, and some are the beautiful city of Oufucheng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let them develop for two or three years on this scale, and I really have no way to take these beasts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a pope in addition to the Marquis, but his face is not as happy as the Marquis, without a smile, reading lips for people like them is not difficult, Werewolf The mouth shape is not very understandable, but the conversation between the dwarf and the half-orc is clear. The pope is naturally not interested in the latter paragraph. He cares about the words in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eagle Eyes is a subtle means of detection for a single magician, or a small group like Diya Valley. But if used in such a war, the effect has been magnified to a decisive point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two days, His Majesty the Pope has already seen almost all of Oufu’s places through these crystal balls. However, for the nearby city of Cedros, I still dare not approach, and the eagle eyes are still the eyes of real masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that's enough, the Pope's face in these two days is almost no better. He is clear about the significance of those huge fields, pastures, and training places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words that emerged from the mouth of the dwarf made him feel extremely uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Tamek Knight is still there, the Pope will immediately order him to bring the head of the very interesting person in the Marquis. This kind of person may only be interesting when the pope is a dead person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship with the School of Magic was officially cut off, and the cut of the tooth was already a place that the hands of the teachings could not touch. As a magician, the Pope himself is well aware of the attraction of the high-end magic gems that are hard to produce in the Defis Mountains, so he is also very aware that the Tower of Tooth must be accepted by Oufu. If the two are slowly combined, the result is self-evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The orc’s combat power has magic again...Sedros wants to wear a magic jade ring for each orc? He wants to The magicians across the continent are all mentally ill? 嘿嘿....." The Pope is probably in a bad mood, but laughs. "Akibad said that it was really right. All things started from the central place, but I still had some disapproval before I was.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
