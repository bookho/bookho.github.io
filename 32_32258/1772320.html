			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also understood another thing that made him puzzled. That is how it can go wrong according to the arrangement he has spent. Around Othello has long been blocked, not to mention elves, even flies should not fly one, but then some other black elf reinforcements have inexplicably killed. This has to be carried out here in a fierce and extreme fight, although now dominates, but the Tauren also suffered heavy casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s impossible for a Tauren to have a traitor to the Black Elf, just as there is no wolf in the wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the priest of Tema always wondered what was going on, but when he saw the Knight of the Temple, he understood that the Knight of the Temple The brilliance of the armor is not the kind of magical brilliance of white light, but the color similar to the surrounding rock wall. This should be the stealth magic of the gas system, until the eye of the eye-catcher’s leader hits his body and the disguise is dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shrine knight, although majoring in magic, strictly seems to be a magician, but melee should be far better than the average warrior. Such a person attaches himself to stealth surgery, and can indeed walk freely in the rumor of Nigan alone without revealing the trace. No one other than the oldest and most sensitive eye-devil leader can detect him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black elf who went out from here to ask for help was absolutely let go of him. This big melee that should not have appeared was also caused by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from his current hand-forward curse scroll, he wants far more than a melee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tauren, the black elf, the demon banshee, the evil eye and the Medusa, in addition to the most cave man slaves, almost all the elites of the Nigan race They have gathered together on the ruins of this Othello. The battle is now nearing the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remnants of the Black Elves and Medusa are preparing to withdraw from this battlefield. At this time, if this curse is released here, the result is not necessary. Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Slaughter these damn church pigs and kill them." The voice of Tima's high priest was filled with huge caves. The feeling of being counted makes him angry and crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, Morrier’s arrogant dragons also came and resounded throughout the Nigan world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This extremely powerful dragonfly has almost the same effect in the ears of every Black Elf. Everyone can hear that this is a scream. This is the scream of their gods, beliefs, and spiritual pillars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black elves who had already begun to retreat were even more defeated. Even the escape of the land is not counted, and many of the black elves in the battle have even forgotten to resist the dodge, directly slashed to the ground by the Tauren and the eagle. The Medusa banshees also hurriedly squirmed their bodies and retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The masters of only a few families can barely maintain their senses and will, commanding all the troops to retreat, but even so, their eyes are completely desperate And confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How could this be... Morrison adults." The main line of Cuihana, who had been fainted, was awakened by this voice. But then I almost went wrong again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this voice, the tales of Tima High Priest were all slightly relieved by the anger, but replaced by a more powerful killing. He understood that he only had to solve the temple here and he would win. Although it is a tragic victory, it is also a complete and complete victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mollier will not be able to kill the cannon fodder that he sent to the place. Although the Knights of the Temple secretly left such a hand, Morial is also the same. They must kill. So the Thamma priest is not too worried, the main force of the Knights of the Temple should still be there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret of leaving a hand naturally is not just the Knights of the Temple, he also has such a similar hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the first rays of the eye, all the floating evil eyes shifted their attention and sight. All mental communication between these creatures is faster than any language. And the eye devil also knows the danger of the reel as well as Tima. In an instant, hundreds of beams of light are shot from the different directions of the cave towards the knight of the shrine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of tidy glare rays are all shot in the position of the Knights of the Temple. These evil eyes may not be as large as a single lethal force, but this is communicated by mental power while the concentrated hundreds of rays are even better than a fire. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no violent collision and explosion, and hundreds of rays concentrated on one point and dazzled, and then the rock wall was completely trapped. A large piece of dark red fluid is present. The rock wall has been melted by the high temperature of concentrated rays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple are not melted, but are non-destructive. At the beginning of the millennium, he opened the sacred guardian shield on the brilliance of the armor, with a sturdy magical barrier that blocked the concentrated shot that could be vaporized by him, and then a cold ice system offset. You can bake him dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he just dropped from the rock wall, he had not had time to move again, and he saw the overwhelming banshee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a little slower than the evil eye movement, and the eagle-winged chieftain, Basile, also opened his mouth and made a sharp scream, then all the eagle in midair. The banshee rushed all the way to the Knights of the Temple. Although their chapters are not long-range units, the speed is not much different from the arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reel is still in hand, but the Knights of the Temple still have no time to unfold, and the double-system fits the curse, even in the most direct and least self-safe way. It takes at least two or three seconds to cast, from unrolling the reel to fully functioning. Although there are still some distances from the eagle banshee, the group at the forefront has already thrown a short knife in their hands. Hundreds of short knives sprinkled like rain, even though he could bear these weapons hard, but the scrolls in his hands could not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Shrine are a short, extremely cursive, intensive, percussive sound. These hundreds of short knives are all less than one meter in front of him. open. With a short knife thrown by the power of the eagle, this force shield is enough to defend completely. But this is the delay, the foremost eagle girl has already rushed. Although these banshees did not have weapons, they did not hesitate, and the huge birds clawed straight toward the Knights of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple drew the sword, and the sword-like light was twisted and twisted into a light net. All the close eagle screams were not screaming. All of them were twisted into pieces of flesh and blood, and they were scattered with the feathers. However, under the screaming scream of the rear of the Lord Basile, this almost natural shock did not stop, and the eagle sluts swooped in and became the broken arm of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thousands of eagle banshees have been sturdy in the space around the Knights of the Temple, and the priest of Tema has finally breathed a sigh of relief. Laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of evil eyes are fluttering toward it, there are more tauren warriors, he knows that the curse reel is absolutely not used. Opportunity, and the Knights of the Temple are undoubtedly a dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand left by the Knights of the Temple has expired. As long as the one he left is still valid, he will win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his smile just emerged and solidified immediately. He lifted his head and looked up at the top of the cave, but he just looked up and couldn't help but close his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only did he close his eyes, but everyone who looked up and looked up on the battlefield closed his eyes, even if it burned Othello. Let them get used to the dim eyes and feel very bright, but the light of the flames and the light that appears on the top of the light ball are not even brighter than the fireflies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun. Only those creatures who have been on the ground have found adjectives suitable for describing this ball of light. And this light ball brings not only the light, but also the incomparable heat wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eagle banshee in front of him rushed and was smashed by the sword in his hand, but Sylvia did not have the slightest sense of accomplishment. On the contrary, his mentality is extremely heavy, because he knows that his task is not finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ordinary eagle banshee is not much stronger than the most common human soldiers. For him, it is harder to deal with these monsters than to cut the melons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter how he slashes, these eagle-like banshees have no intention of retreating, needless to say that this scroll is displayed, even It is very difficult to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
