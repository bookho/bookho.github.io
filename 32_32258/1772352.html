			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor, the bishop, all the clergy have already fallen under this miracle, but the pope has the highest position, and the spokesperson who claims that God is in the world has not left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is also the priest who is the highest priesthood. The priest of the shrine, Lancelot, who was given the title of the paladin by the Pope, did not kneel down. Now I didn't even look up to see the angels in the world, but suddenly I took out the sword and chopped Asa on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is the same as the two Necromancers, keeping the posture that was solidified at the time and fell to the ground, the Templars have no way to put that The stiff body is pulled into an easy-to-bundle position, and then the phoenix that suddenly appears makes everyone innocently distracted by the person who has been turned into a puppet by the pope. It wasn't until this time that Lancelot suddenly seemed to be amazed, and the sword was cut toward Asa on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Lancelot was just moving, Asa also replied from the state of the puppet, and jumped over and escaped the blue Slot's sniper rushed toward the Knights of the Temple of Ayimei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the giant angel appeared in the sky above the bright hall, Asa felt that he was beginning to dissipate with his own strength. He was originally planning to sneak out Ai Meimei when everyone was attracted by the big battle, but he just found a sign of Lancelot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai Yimei was caught in the hands of the Knights of the Temple who had appeared in the caves of Nemo Mori, she even in the hands of the Knights of the Temple There are no opportunities for casting. Since the appearance of the huge angel in the sky, both her and the spirit of the Knights of the Temple have been attracted. They are, or have been, devout believers, and the miracles above the sky can really make any heart still <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zoom in infinitely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when Asa got up and rushed, the Knights of the Temple reacted. He immediately took the sword. He was on the neck of Ai Meimei and drank on Asa: "Stand up..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rushed reaction he had no time to resist, so only This is a very effective means of threatening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Assas didn’t mean to stand still, and he took out the knife and pulled it out. The knife was like a black snarl, and it seemed to be with an incomparable power. The Knights of the Temple and Ayimei in his hands have been smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple only let go, back. But the knife that looked so fierce was suddenly disappearing when I reached Ai Mei. Ai Yimei hasn't responded yet. What's the matter? It's a flower in front of me, and the wind around me is so loud. Has been pulled up by Asara. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt and Hilika also responded to the action, but the strange thing is that these two original actions are very fast and abnormal, but the knights are now even ordinary people. It’s better to stand up like a toddler baby. Try to move your body. The white light rain falling all over the sky immediately melted on the body of the priests and healed the wound, but it fell on the body of the fear knight. It was like ice water falling on the red soldering iron. The light screams, the stench of the disgusting smell, and then the stench is dissipated in the air filled with white magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Standing." Another stop, but this is from the mouth of Lancelot. He has already arrived behind Asa. A sword stabbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa still didn't stand. He held Ai Meimei in one hand and leapt in the air and greeted Lanslot's long sword. Of course he can't stand, this time is the best chance to escape from Leicester, although still full of pastors and templars, but the fabulous battle over the sky has left them innocent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the loud noise of the sword, Asana flew the black knife and he threw it himself. Lancelot's sword is not very lethal, but the sword is sucking. And the follow-up trend of this sword is completely unable to retreat. Even if it is impossible to beat Asa in a sword, but the sword skills, the gap between the two is still too big to count, so Asa only abandoned the knife and then punched. He will use this fist to borrow and continue to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fist and the sword will be handed over, Lancelot’s sword is slightly received, and then heavily stabbed in the fist. Only this one has been able to avoid the light of the moment when the fist is the most violent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
