			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palace in the palace of the palace was lit up all night, and the ministers who were called to the hall by the cardinal on the same day are now rushing, but the emperor’s majesty does not include Although it is important to meet the people of Oufu, it seems more appropriate to stay in the harem to accompany the empress. It is enough for these old ministers to have the head of Roland and the prime minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who came were Europa City Lord Sedros and his deputy Bolugan. The dresses of the two men who rushed in did not make the taste of a country’s negotiations simple and simple. But no one has the slightest disdain for them. In this extraordinary period, Cedros also personally came here to see the importance of his attention. At this time, Einfas also needs Oufu. Even the most old-fashioned ministers no longer have the slightest energy to care about these little things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting has been going on for almost dawn. When the ministers came out of the hall of the proceedings, the look on their faces seemed a bit eccentric but not the slightest. The joy of love seems to have another layer of bigger shadows in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros only took a small break in the arranged pavilion and secretly received them to the Prime Minister’s Office. There is another meeting here waiting for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the prime minister’s study, Roland Head and Asa, have been waiting here. Except for Asa, all the people stayed up all night in the palace and discussed the relationship between Oufu and Ian Fast. The discussion was fierce and lasted for a long time. What is to be discussed here is a more hidden and more essential issue than a deeper layer in the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Sandro refuses to agree with me?" asked Xiao Xiao. In fact, asking Sandru to be the court magician is her suggestion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems impossible to agree." Asa smiled and shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if there are still many things that are known to the ministers who know that Bishop Javey is the Necromancer, they are not known. For example, the true identity of Bishop Javey and the relationship with the Marquis of Hamm, etc., which involve the Deya Valley, are all mixed up with a vague excuse. Sandru's identity is still confidential. It is said to other ministers that a friend of the sorcerer Ronis, who retired from the Descartes Valley, was invited by the head of Roland to save the crisis. Xiao Yan is trying to take the opportunity to bring Shan Drew to the front of the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros smiled and shook his head: "The most fundamental code of the Deya Spirit Masters for hundreds of years is actually not to intervene in this dusty world. The time of the year, especially the mages who joined the last two or three decades, have the power to fame and fortune, but people like Sander will never compete for power."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the experience of continuous long-distance flights and then overnight meetings, Cedros seems so energetic. The scent of a pair of scorpions is no worse than that of young people. Although the two eye-changing bags show that he has not rested for a while, he still has a glory. Because the result of a chattering night last night was that the Oufu and Esfans empire immediately became an alliance. This is of course a good thing for him to be inspired by the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal sent by His Majesty the Pope is a Necromancer who seeks to squat. Although this kind of thing cannot be made public, the fact is already there. The relationship between the empire and the church has finally been completely shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the relationship between the School of Magic and the Church began to be detached from Bishop Ronis. Bishop Ronis has always intentionally or unintentionally downplayed this relationship. He almost never returned to Celeste to see the Pope as an example. After two decades of subtle influence, although the same God is the same doctrine, but the ordinary people of the empire in the eyes of the church, all the land of Celeste has no place. The holy place in their eyes is actually the magic school in the kingdom. This is also an important prerequisite for this break with Celeste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twenty-year-old foreshadowing finally hit the full rest at this time. Unfortunately, Bishop Ronis can't see it all. However, from the general trend. Only after his death, Celeste’s relationship with the School of Magic will be picked up in the clear place to have such a complete break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javier is now half-dead and incarcerated. All martial arts and magic are abolished by Roland and Sander. What is now being announced temporarily is that the Cardinal adult suddenly died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
