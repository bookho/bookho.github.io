			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three days from the re-existence of Bracada, I finally saw the shadow of the Wyvern. Asa shouted and waved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operation of the two-legged dragon circling over his head for a while. The beast talent decided to fly down to see this human who dared to say hello below. Asa and the Orc Scouts said for a while and finally sat on the Wyvern to return to Oufu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the City Hall and found that Sedros Asa threw the peace agreement of His Majesty the Emperor to him and sighed and said: "I don't know why it is clearly." Everything that can be done actually says 'I am none.' I am also prepared for what a large group of followers have to push down or if they have to go slowly with them in the wasteland to find me trouble." Brd/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros smiled and opened the agreement and looked at it: "In fact, this big thing should have been your emperor to personally sign with me, but that is still only a child. Even the decision to sign the agreement is not all that the ministers negotiated and they don’t need him to go through this scene. So I let the messenger sent it to say that it’s okay to send him a messenger. The opportunity that is specially reserved for you is a great task that can easily take a large amount of political capital. Bishop Ronis will naturally send it to your head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Asa smiled a bit for other people, this is probably an opportunity to dream. Perhaps Bishop Ronis is trying to give himself a big thank you, but he is totally uninterested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros has carefully signed the agreement on the agreement to meet the land and sigh. This last step has finally finished the wrinkles on his face. It seems that there are fewer sighs: "Well, it is the age of peace. The new page of history will start the era of the era of peaceful coexistence between orcs and human beings." It’s just starting today”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa suddenly remembered a question and asked: “The orcs who used to be wild and highland are eating people.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah. If people are hungry, don’t they eat chickens and eat pigs and eat cows?” Cedrus’s tone is still flat. It’s like this kind of behavior is just as bright as eating green radish. . "But now the orcs are almost all saved from my childhood. Let them grow up together with human beings and completely lose their original customs and culture. They are essentially the same as humans. You also saw Oufu. Here humans and orcs live together very well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I mean the hatred of people and orcs is so easy to resolve? Those who have been killed by orcs For example, the soldiers who were killed by you and the generals some days ago"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros smiled and said: "I believe that Oufu will bring to the countries afterwards." The trade benefits and gifts for the ministers are enough for people to forget these old things. The gold coins in the eyes are definitely more valuable than the blood in the memory. They will also help us solve these problems. You Looking at the soldiers that we had to kill the other day, did the Imperial Court not laugh at it? In fact, even if I didn’t kill them, do you think they would end up after they went back? The Imperial Court has already made a peace agreement with me. The common interests of parents for long-term cooperation must be completely violated by military orders to kill those who may be disadvantaged to everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is 5,000 lives." "Asa thought about it and smiled a bit." At that time, the horrible form of the black body of the place and the screams of 5,000 people almost died that he had not slept every night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros faintly said: "As the upper class, the overall interests of the country are considered. What are the 5,000 people? If it is necessary, 50,000 people are not saying Kill and kill." He looked at Asa with a gaze. "If you are a big thing, you can't take care of the rules. You can't take care of your feelings. It seems that your woman's benevolence is too heavy and I have to practice slowly how to get rid of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Asa is still laughing and waving. "Forget it, I will travel after I finish this. I can't do anything big and I never thought about doing it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Travel?" Cedrus seemed to look at him with a strange look for the first time he heard the word. "Do you still want to travel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Asa nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros’s vision is still so strange. "I didn't know how to plan for Ronis. But I saw that you sent a peace agreement. I know that he is ready to make you a hero of thousands of people to achieve something big. How can you still think about it? Going to travel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this hat does not care that Asa is not interested in his head but not appetite. "I knew that I would reject his kindness. I am really not interested in these."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero. This title is really very beautiful. However, as early as when King was accompanying Rod Hart, Asa had experienced the political game means and the assassination and falsehood behind this highly anticipated word. The gentle smile of the Duke of Mulak was so dear and once he said so sincerely to him, but the sword behind the night was so terrible. To tell the truth, even if he is now unable to raise any hostility towards the Duke, he feels that he is completely bored with this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And doing a big business like this, he never thought about it even when he was a child. Moreover, the Duke and the few classes that Cedros had given him also made him very disgusted with the ‘big things’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reject?" Cedrus’s expression was even more strange. It’s not just the first time I heard the word, I just heard a joke that makes people laugh and laugh. "Can you still refuse? Do you still have to go to the position of this hero to do something big?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether you like it or not Must be a hero must do something big. This is like a joke that makes people laugh, but there is no trace of a joke on the face of the speaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa can feel that there is something wrong with this joke. He solemnly and clearly expressed his attitude and said: "In my dictionary, there is no such thing as 'must' except for eating and drinking, sleeping and urinating."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros looked at Asa and nodded thoughtfully. "It turns out that he hasn't told you yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the old man’s face like a smile, Asa Momo feels a bit hairy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell is going on, I can't say you are going back and ask him." Sedros seemed to be reluctant to say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dealing with the things of Oufu quickly, Asa returned to the king and returned to the School of Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every building in the college is so tall and grand, it expresses the noble and sacred, and the most conspicuous is the number in the center of the college. The ten-meter-high cathedral is as small as anyone in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stood in front of the door and looked up at the sacred tall building of the cathedral as if it were more uncomfortable than ever. He even drummed up the courage to step into this door like a monster. Bishop Ronis was surprised by the sudden appearance of Asa. He was preparing to hold a grand ceremony with the Emperor of the Emperor for the return of the official. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Asa’s words, Bishop Ronis smiled and asked: “Do you want to be a hero? Don’t want to be admired? This is what many people dream of. Ah."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa resolutely shook his head: "I don’t want to be respected by the heroes, don’t you respect me. What is it about me? I don’t have a lot of meat and I still have three meals a day. Rice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Ronis smiled and nodded. Say: "But I hope that you can do this"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa once again stressed: "I am sorry for the bishop. I am coming back to tell you that I am not doing these inexplicable "Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must do this." Bishop Ronis is very light but the words are significant. "You have no choice. Whether you love and not love you, the task that the times give you is the peace of the whole big 6."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course It is my freedom to choose what I want to do." Asa answered with confidence. And this is indeed a reason for being justified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa took out the letter of appointment and the token was thrown on the table. He has always been very respectful to the old man who saved himself several times but now he is a little disgusted. "I don't know what the times are and what I have never received from him. I only know that I don't like to do this. I never think there is anything I have to do. Well, I will return the position of the priest to you now. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa snorted. "I know that they are not afraid of me. I have my own way of dealing with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you know that I should also help them. In the name of the church, you are even wanted to negotiate with the Emperor’s Majesty to chase you.” Bishop Ronis is still dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s mouth is too big to be closed anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as I open up almost all of the big 6 countries will pass you. And for me it really should be done, do you know?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." Asa mechanically swayed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s true that from the national perspective, the mysterious people of the elves are insignificant and the myths of their races are even more nonsense. After all, the maintenance of the country is It’s the history of military economics and politics. These history are also written by these very real concepts. So politicians don’t care about what is bright and dark, and even many people in the church don’t care about this.” Bishop’s The hand reached out with a thin finger and gently positioned himself. "They don't believe it, but I believe it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you believe" Asa asked cautiously. Bishop Rooney replied faintly: "I believe that the Sunwell and the leaves of the world tree are indeed symbols of the power of light. Only light is the power to resist the darkness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa suddenly remembered a nasty story that he almost forgot to just consider as a fart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Ronis looked at Asa and sighed and said: "The elves should have told you the stories they have circulated?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa couldn’t help but lick her mouth. It’s the story of the fart, but if you say it very seriously from the mouth of the noble bishop, I’m afraid no one will dare to be a fart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The evil thing in their mouth is actually the sacred object of the Necromancer guild, a sword called the Dark Star." The voice of Bishop Ronis is in the room. Fluttering with the unique deep sense of history. "Five hundred years ago, the most powerful magician of the history, Agibad, entered the whistle valley, which has never been entered, and the god of darkness and death, the black star. He was darked by the stars. Powerful powers conquered the wizards who worshipped the darkness and death of the Necromancer Society. Even the magician who claims to be closest to God could not pull up the Dark Star. But he finally left a last word: Can you put this The sword-up person will become the king of the dead, cleaning the world with death and darkness. But he also vaguely mentioned the other two bright and life-like elves who guard the sun well and the world tree. Ye. This and the ancient legends of the elves confirm that the result is very obvious. Indeed, as the elves say against the darkness, they only use the power of light and life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Wait, etc. If this is the case, what has the church not done for so many years?" Asa suddenly remembered the wrong place. The power of the Bright Church on the Big 6 is by no means comparable to any country. Not only the vast majority of countries on the Empire 6 believe in the god of light. The church has always been ignorant of the righteousness of justice and has no reason to turn a blind eye to such a huge shadow of the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light that was seen in the eyes of Bishop Rooney was all depressed and troubled for the first time. He didn’t explain anything. He just smiled and said: "The reason for this is that you will I know," his eyes flashed and he returned to the topic. "If you let the people of the Necromancer know the two forces you carry, they will not let you go. So the safest and safest way to do it is to hold you in an absolutely safe and absolutely secret place. Find ways to take out the power in your body. But the majestic and deep appearance and noble status can't hide the gentleness of the current bishop's eyes. "When I heard that you are willing to use the leaves of the world tree to save others, I know that your heart is definitely bright. So I changed theism. I don't passively arrest you to protect you but to make you a hero of light. In the end, I will destroy the roots of evil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to these words, Asa only felt that the head was at least a dozen times larger than usual, and he was several hundred times more dizzy. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how much effort I spent trying to sort out my thoughts and try to express my meaning: “That’s just because her injuries are caused by me. I save. She just wants to be better than herself. I don’t know anything about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa only felt that the head was going to explode. Facing such an old man who seems to be patiently motivated by nature but really difficult to communicate, he can’t be too big to be uneasi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the damn sun well and the world tree leaf are so important, even if there is any light and darkness, these Asa don't care. What he cares about is that this hero is a must. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elderly are usually very stubborn and want to convince the bishops who believe in these legends to give up these beliefs more than to make themselves really believe in those illusory ghosts. hundred times. And as long as Bishop Ronis really believes that he will only consider it as he did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not so much a heroic path as it is to avoid being a container that is tightly guarded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church can have such a high status in the empire, almost all of which is the work of Bishop Ronis. Thirty years ago, the 6th east of this wild land was centered on the Ian Fast Empire, and several countries were indiscriminate. It was Bishop Roones who led the church forces that were not so large at the time of the East 6 and used various means to mediate and participate in the war. In the end, it not only ended the war but also raised the status of the church in the empire to an unprecedented height. Therefore, his prestige in the Holy See is by no means comparable to other bishops. It is said that if he insisted on staying here to preside over the current Pope’s position in the School of Magic, he should have come to sit. To be a man in his capacity to be a man is not just an empire and other countries that believe in a bright church. Even other pagan countries will do their best to capture this wanted criminal because of diplomatic pressure. The whole big 6 has no place for him to stand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the vision of Bishop Ronis, Asa understands one thing. At least not able to refuse now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try it out too. So many people are willing to do big things to become a hero may be really a good thing. Understand that there is no way out, Asa only thinks this way. He finally lost his strength and helplessly bowed his head and sighed like a student who accepted the next batch of holiday homework: "I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ronnis The bishop smiled and smiled very happy after a sigh. It seems as happy and satisfying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I have to ask a question." Asa suddenly looked up and asked Bishop Ronis. "Why don't you blame me for returning me to the elves when I was half-dead? I really want to take it back as a container. Isn't that simple? I think you should not be planning for the Duke. Think about it. Why are you wasting a leaf of the world tree that is so important to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop’s face has a strange complex The expression of this wave of entanglement on the face for a while before slowly re-entering his majestic and deep appearance. He did not respond positively to the two lights in his eyes, which kept flashing words because they involved many things in memory and picked them up. "I used to not believe in fate, but I saw you in my life. I have saved you. It is also part of the fate. Maybe there is something in the dark that is already doomed. So I used to feel confused. Those who have the chance to become a reality are very scared. I don’t know if my efforts for so many years are not in vain. Will it be in vain? But after I talked to you last time, I finally made up my mind, no matter what the outcome, I also Trying to do what I should do. I must lead you to the road of light. To justice. There used to be someone who is as good as you, very kind, very pure, and involuntarily, dragging him into these whirlpools. Into the darkness, the fire in his eyes burned very warmly. This is not a natural manifestation of personal emotions that can be provoked by things like responsibility. This kind of strong emotion actually appears to be more extraordinary in a person who should be more emotional. He looked at Asa as if he wanted to use his own eyes and feelings to illuminate the young man in front of him and said very hard: "I saved you because fate is also because of rebellion."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa didn’t understand it, but it’s faint, but I still don’t understand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already dusk when it comes out of the Magic Academy. The streets of Wangdu are preparing for the upcoming gorgeous nightlife. The carriages carrying aristocratic women began to come and go. The cheap prostitutes in the pubs and some of the cheaper prostitutes in the building also appeared on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of Ronis has embarked on a series of cumbersome preparatory work and several large officials to negotiate with the court, etc. These things, Asa does not want to intervene, I don’t know. How to intervene, he only needs to go back and wait for the grand award ceremony of the day to wait step by step to the Avenue of Stars that Bishop Ronis has prepared for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
