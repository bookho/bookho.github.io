			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru pointed to Asa and said to the guest: "This guy recently likes to go out and fool at night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people are inevitably like this." The guest nodded and smiled. His words were as full of understanding and tolerance as a child who was facing the child's fault, but the hoarse voice could make people The creeps are stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one else can make such an unpleasant sound. Asa, the nephew of this signature test, immediately recognized that this was the necromancer of the bishop of the singer, who was almost smashed into a piece of meat in the whispering sorcerer. And now this monster actually understands his own tone of the elders. This is absolutely a weird thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru’s lazy and eccentric look is like this is really just a regular friend who comes to tea and chat. He stood up and threw a sentence: "Let's talk slowly. I am sitting outside for a while." Turned out of the big house and took the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sit down.” The lich, like a hospitable master, reached out and pointed to a stone table that was hollow out of a corpse. In this place where the body is all, she looks like a scholar in the ancient books of the flowers, and the environment is very harmonious and harmonious. It seems to be a very suitable owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa can hear his heartbeat and breath. This is the only living thing in the whimsical house of corpses and organs. He looked at the lich with a slight alert and hesitated and walked over to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this monster appeared here at the old man of Sandru, he should not be so troublesome to ask him. At least Sandron has no reason to frame himself. And just now he is a bit curious about the Necromancer and wants to hear what the Necromancer is looking for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought that our past misunderstandings would make you very wary." The lich smiled. Her fake face should be Sandro's masterpiece. I don't know what magic to use on it. "I want to introduce myself first so that I can save a lot of time explaining the hostility and misunderstanding... I am a lich. You can call me Vide Nina simply to say that I am your classmate."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Classmate?" Asa blinked. He never remembered that he had such a relationship, let alone a lich. And ‘Ved Nina’ is obviously the name of a woman. Asa carefully looked at the undead monster who claimed to be a classmate. It took a little effort to connect his sinister impression with the concept of ‘female.’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. I used to be a teacher of Sandro and a student of Teacher Rooney. It’s naturally your classmate. Now you should know us. It’s not an enemy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa was shocked that this necromancer had a relationship with Sandru, but it was also true with Bishop Rooney. This is incredible for teachers and students. Surprisingly, there was no clarification. At least in his own impression, he never looked at the old man and the bishop of Sandru as a teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to be surprised. I don’t know if there is any data record in the School of Magic.... A long time ago, when I was a human, the name was Vedina. Geffenhart is now a lich, the most noble and honorable sorcerer organization - a member of the Necromancer Society."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Geffen Hart? This .... seems to be the royal family's last name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vadina's throat has a burst of bellows broke the sound of Assam I realized that it was probably a light laugh. "The name is just a code name, but the surname is nothing more than the actual meaning of others. The existence of the highest and most intelligent existence of the lich has long since abandoned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa frowns and hardly re-read this monster from head to toe. It is hard to imagine that this monster actually has such an amazing identity. He asked: "What are you doing to come to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vide Nina's fake face reveals a smile that seems to be a fake. "I probably guessed that you must be very depressed and very troubled recently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa could not help but nod. Since Bishop Ronis forced him to accept the job, he was really very bored and very annoyed. The tasks that the things that come into contact are all that he is not good at not knowing how to deal with it. Now he can’t solve the problem with his own way, almost all of them are led by others. This feeling is really not good. He feels that his brains seem to be getting more and more sluggish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enn." Asa nodded again. I can't help but feel very much the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I am here to help you," said the kind student. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me? How to help?" Asa asked with a bright eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I represent the most noble and honorable wizard organization in the world - the Necromancer Society invites you to join."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just kidding. Don't do it." Asa almost refused if she didn't even think about it. "I don't like to be a hero but I don't want to be a zombie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hehehehe...." The laughter of the Lich should be goodwill. But it also made Asa a layer of goose bumps. It seems that the full body of the body and organs are moving in this voice. "I think the biggest reason for your rejection is because of the reputation of our guild. Let me explain the misunderstandings of the frogs who are just the secular people on our bottoms. I will ask you what you think. What kind of place should we Deya Valley be?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can question this question and don’t need to guess the bard and the legend The information in the mouth is really innumerable. Asa casually recited a paragraph: "The zombies and the heavens are all ghosts and ghosts. There is no life. The dead gods are eating the human flesh and drinking blood. How to resurrect the demon god...."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Non-speaking." Ved Nina is another burst of laughter that wants the bodies to jump up and interrupt Asa's back. "The sunrise of the highest peak of the Shadow Mountain Range and the Mirage of the Dragon Desert are definitely one of the most beautiful and beautiful scenery of the Big Six. From the icy peaks of the Shadow Mountain Range to the flats of the spring season to the hot valley, the climate is very different. 6 All the most precious and rare flowers and plants grow in the flute valley. I'm sure that the whole big 6 will never have a better place than the flute valley. As for the cultural atmosphere, I don't describe it well. It is said that there are wines that even the emperors of the world can hardly taste, and there are at least three members of the art collection that are at least three members of the royal family."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to the Lich is probably the most ugly voice of the Big Six, telling the most dangerous and evil places as one of the most beautiful tourist attractions in Asahaha. This is probably the best laughing cow in the Big Six. This classmate is probably the most funny undead monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn’t laugh very much at once. Because for his big laugh, Ved Nina only smiled lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s still a fake face, it’s still a little self-confident and self-confident, but it can be felt by anyone. What's more, a lich will never come here to tell a joke to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past ten years, there have been nearly a hundred people who have gone through all the hardships to come to the Descartes Valley. Of course, they died in the Dragon Desert and the Shadow Mountain. Even more countless. I found the most murderous murderers of the 6 most vicious criminals in the Descartes Valley. Killing people is not only the most basic commonality of those people, but also the collectors who have lived and dismembered girls. The face of the cockroaches is also good because only others despise him, he will kill a whole village... They all want to join the legendary mortal guild to get rid of the outside society and their ultimatum can enjoy the killing and corpse more boldly. But you Guess what their results are?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't you be allowed to join?" Asa asked. No matter who judges these people, it seems that they are born to be the preparatory members of the Necromancer Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They don't deserve it." Ved Nina's voice said that it was harder to hear when it was scornful than to use a sickle to smash the iron. "These garbage doesn't even have the qualification to leave the body in the Deya Valley. They all become zombies or ghosts wandering forever in the Deva Valley as a coolie and guard. The Necromancer is the most noble organization in the world. Elegant talents are eligible to join many of their artists who are fascinating in this society or the industry leaders who are proud of their princes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Sa really can't smile. He remembered the three names that Bishop Ronis told him. He asked: "The former president of the Empire Adventurers Guild, the singer of the singer, the sorcerer of the Principality of the Principality of the Principality of the Principality of Ramallos. These people are really the people of the Necromancer?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The Lich is very frank and has no meaning to hide. "These thoughts should be told by Teacher Rooney. Now you believe it. We are all such elegant and excellent people. How can people live like poverty? Poverty like a mouse? We have the ability and of course more qualifications." Enjoy the highest enjoyment in the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have said that those frogs that are just the bottom of the well have a fascination for us. You probably haven't touched the high-level magic yet, so you don't understand. There is no magic that is deeper, more subtle and more artistic than the Necromancer. The lich waved his dry fingers and pointed at the dense bodies around him. "Look at how perfect the body is, how perfect it is. Even the finest works of the finest craftsmen are as rough as a person's fingers. So it's not a smart qualification. People are not qualified to learn this kind of advanced magic. And people gather together to say that our guild is completely the highest place in the world to gather the most outstanding people. It is a very beautiful thing to join us?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is silent and has not answered. After thinking about it for a long while, he asked: "Why should you let me join your organization?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you should join the Necromancer Society." Ved Nina's answer was very firm and discourse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled and said with a smile: "I think it is because of the world tree leaves and the sun well and your dark star." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Bishop Ronis has already told himself why. The real purpose behind the wonderful rhetoric that surrounds such a big bend should be this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ved Nina smiled and even the fake eyes made with the eyes of the dead also smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not answer Asa’s words, but she said the key points in a faint sigh: "What some of the inexplicable things that Professor Ronis should tell you. I I’m probably thinking about what kind of stereotypes are nothing more than evil deconstruction and destruction of the world.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is it not?” Asa Feel the pressure. What I know in this classmate's mouth today is too abnormal and it sounds like there are more people who are missing glasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have to refute and explain, just ask you to use your own clear mind to think about it and understand that it is purely nonsense. I ask you why we want Let's kill everyone and turn this big 6 into a dead place? Can you watch the world's skeletons and zombies stay? Even the most cruel vampires don't have such thoughts. What about us as a noble group? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you believe in the gods of the destruction of the gods of darkness?" Asa continued to bring the story and the legendary routines up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Faith?" The lich looked at Asa and asked. "Do you still believe in gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No..." Asa shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if you don't believe in us, will we still believe in it?" The Lich's answer is a bit confusing, but Asa feels vaguely understandable. . “Faith is for the inner weak to support faith and spirit. Those who are truly mature and powerful will not believe in belief and will only believe in what they see and feel.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "It's not destroying the world...that's conquering the world." Asa tried to think about a more appropriate reason to take a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Conquering the world? It’s too tacky and too tasteless." The laughter of the Lich showed incomparable contempt and contempt for the word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The desire to conquer is only a young person who does not know the high-quality leaks of special products or the inferiority of the inferiority complex. Is the world stepping on your feet? Impossible. You still have the same emotions and sorrows, and you are still tired. How can we be more and more obsessed with the people who have become more and more mundane? **What's more...." The Lich's tone has changed to a dull level but has reached a thousand. "Even if we really want to conquer the world, it doesn't take much effort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa sighed and finally showed a relaxed expression. Because I can finally be sure that this classmate is really talking nonsense. I can't think of a lich who actually has the ability and the skin to blow such a large cowhide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Vindina did not feel that his cowhide was broken and continued to say in a faint tone: "Use force to conquer people." It’s synonymous with stupidity. It’s much easier to manipulate the people of Limin or control a country than to make a good zombie. It’s very strange to know that this society is a very weird thing. The lower class people are very honest and simple, obeying officials and legal officials and the law and obeying the king of the monarch. So just controlling the top few people is equivalent to controlling the whole country and moving with our ability wisdom and means several times. What is difficult for a coup to help those who are easy to control to seek a squat?" Vide Nina’s crying voice is a ugly voice that cannot be said with a lingering tone. “Even just out of interest, the guys in the guild alone can provoke a war.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if it is the whole country that is crazy to let them conquer the world, it is not difficult. People not only surrender and the social class will give their thoughts and feelings to religious philosophy and some inexplicable values ​​and beliefs. What we have is People's feelings and understandings are like the masters of emotions playing with building blocks. It is simpler to manipulate those obsessed with red dust. Just grasping the lines of these religions and beliefs can completely control them as long as they master the correct method. They will follow you to any place, even hell..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it’s good..." Asa announced his surrender under the unparalleled eloquence of this classmate. His brain is already in chaos. Take a few deep breaths and rectify the brain that is about to boil back to the center of the problem. "I admit that you are really a master concentration camp. But I still don't know what you want me to join you. I really don't believe in Sunwell and the leaves of the world tree."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or that sentence you should have joined the Necromancer Association." Ved Nina's answer also returned to the unclear place but added one. "As for those relationships, you will understand it when you join..." The green fire behind her eyes flashed. "The most important thing is that as soon as you join us, you are completely free. What elves and churches are all in front of us is waste. What you can do to do what you want."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa took a long breath. It is said that this old half-day finally heard the most tempting and practical thing for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And it also explains to you the situation of our noble organization, so you don’t have to worry about anything. I have completely passed the formalities for you. More than half of the members' consent is as long as you can nod." Ved Nina's dead eyes looked at Asa. "How."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa’s brains turned hard but couldn’t help but clue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of Vid Nina just enough to subvert the conditions of any person’s mindset of the Necromancer’s mind and the prospects for him are completely Beautiful. Compared with the present, under the command of the bishop of King Duron, he is so depressed that it is simply another village. But he feels that some places are still not right, but there is nowhere to say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it." Asa finally sighed and refused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ved Nina smiled and didn't seem to be frustrated. She took out a reel from her arms and handed it to Asa. "Now I don't need to make a decision for the time being. This is for you to come straight when you want to come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa hesitated or took it. Suddenly I remembered asking: "The vampire in the hunting ground a few days ago was released by you? Can you tell me who did it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Most of us do not interfere with each other. I don't know much about what other members do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can tell me who is yours in this kingdom Undercover?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This can't tell you that you naturally know when you become a member of us."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay. I have already told you everything I want to tell you. Now I am going back to Deya Valley." Vide Nina took out a reel and unfolded it all over the blue. In the light of white. "I hope that you don't tell me that Dr. Ronis will make Mr. Andrew's teacher awkward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This doesn't need you to say." Sa nodded. If Bishop Roones knew the Necromancer to invite him, would he still have it? Maybe he was sent directly to the dungeon for safety reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vide Nina’s figure just disappeared in the transmission of the light, Drew, opened the door and came in. I glanced at the tail of the blue and white light and sighed and said to myself: "I really don't want to make me embarrassed, you just don't come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Asa looked at the place where the lich had just sat, and she scratched her head and thought about turning her head and looking at Sandru. "Is it true that she said it?" He heard that Shande Lu was not far outside the door and he and Videnina talked to him. He should have heard it all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." Sandru answered in a deadly manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
