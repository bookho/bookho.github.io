			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president of the Chamber of Commerce has an old face green and green. He couldn’t think of his hard work and the fact that he finally achieved the appreciation of Her Majesty. The Cardinal did not care that he had turned all his efforts into nothing in one sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen’s sigh sighed with a look of embarrassment on her face. "But and the situation in Elasia is not stable now because the trade is hindered, and economic production has a downward trend. And the domestic thieves gangs are becoming more and more ill-fated. The devils in the underground are also not safe. At this time, rashly It is really inappropriate to raise a soldier. I feel that it is necessary to wait and see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop said: "Is there more to maintain the Lord’s glory and believers’ beliefs? Is it important?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The embarrassing color on the face of Her Majesty’s face is still not lightened and she shook her head and said, “But the situation in the country is indeed true.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will remind you, you are a king, but you should still put the loyalty of the Lord’s faith to the Pope first." The Cardinal has not looked back. The power of the deterrent, but at least half of the people in the hall have changed their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden silence in the hall. The ministers did not even dare to force their breath. It was the first time that the subtle friction between Her Majesty the Queen and the Church was vaguely felt and so clearly and straightforwardly expressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's natural, please rest assured." Queen Catherine's expression did not react violently to this sentence, just nodded and sighed. Her ruthless face like a knife-cut willow is even more difficult. This look appeared in her clear and elegant face and the original majestic face is more touching than any delicate and delicate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ministers did not look at the above in the official field for a lifetime. They are all familiar with what kind of performance should be in this delicate occasion. So the expression of Her Majesty did not see them. The following Lutheran Chamber of Commerce has seen it clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of the Chamber of Commerce is smashing the cardinal. In his view, these four sticks are not in the same place, but they are still in the high position, and people like themselves are working hard to earn money to support them. They still have to look at them. This is enough to prove that God is absolutely It does not exist, even if it exists, it is not worthy of respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the words of the bishop and also saw the look of His Majesty the Queen. In particular, seeing the beautiful face of Liya's unparalleled face is slightly aggrieved and seems a bit unwilling. This makes him feel a sigh of relief from the anger of his stomach. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even though it’s a slick mind and experience that has been screaming for decades and people’s communication, it’s subconscious to make this statement gentle and courteous. "The Queen of the Episcopal Queen is the lord of tens of millions of people in Erasia. Her piety is unquestionable. And Her Majesty has to manage so many things to consider. Naturally, you don’t have to I have to worry about the common affair. The Bishop of Ronald of Dongda 6 never asks for government affairs, but the status of the School of Magic can still be in the Einfast Empire."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bold." A fierce anger screamed, but the voice of the Chamber of Commerce was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The constellation of the goddess behind the priest, the phoenix phoenix roars a golden long windless automatic her words and looks at the Lutheran Chamber of Commerce It’s all suffocating. "Is these words something that people like you can say? The following offenses against the bishops and the words you just confuse are enough to make you sin on the stake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of the Chamber of Commerce were pale and he was scared by this loud drink and added this sentence almost scared him down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Knights of the Temple, please remember that the palace of Elazia is not the shining castle of Seyster." A voice screamed weakly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking is a middle-aged swordsman with a full body light armor standing in the position closest to Queen Catherine. Although he still wears a sword in the palace, he does not seem to have the mighty power of a military commander. He even has a sallow vaginal band on his face. He occasionally holds his fist into the mouth and keeps a cough on his mouth. under. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know where this is. No need to remind." The Knights of the Goddess proudly watched the sculpted swordsman’s sculptural facial lines also show Sculpture-like chill. “It’s just that I don’t have to converge on the Lord’s faith and anger against God.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talis Knights don't get excited." Bishop Esshir waved his hand. “The kings of Erassia in the past are devout believers. The loyal guardians have incalculable achievements in the faith of the propagandist. It really deserves the respect of anyone. The same is true of Her Majesty the Queen. "The Cardinal showed an absolutely rare smile to Queen Catherine. "Please also forgive her impulses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Catherine also nodded with a smile on Esshir. "The devout and faith of the Knights of Talis is not to be blamed for me." She waved at the swordsman below. "General Ou Ling also understands this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sick swordsman has no strength and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal continues to smile and said, "I see that you are deeply troubled by the thieves and the younger generation. It is better to let the Talis Knights solve these problems for His Majesty." Worry, it can be regarded as her experience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is work. There is a knight in the town of Weizhen. It seems that my troubles are very fast." It no longer exists." The smile on Queen Catherine's face became more and more charming. She nodded to the female knight and then looked at Bishop Esshir. "The bishop is also pleased that I will arrange the domestic affairs as soon as possible and then I can discuss the next thing about Oufu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal smiles The queen nodded. The initiators of these two tense atmospheres are now so intimate and harmonious. The tone and expression of a group of friends who respect each other and respect each other are all friendly. The smell that just seemed awkward in the air dissipated immediately in this atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Bishop Esshir turned to look at the president of the business, the expression on his face was completely awe-inspiring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President of Luther Chamber of Commerce is now scared, scared and fearful. He was never afraid to face the eyes of Bishop Esser. of. But the eyes of the bishops, like the old wells, seem to be full of strange appeals, but they can’t be moved again. It’s not just the attention that seems to have the soul gradually plunged into the two scorpions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I forgive you in the name of the Lord. But after you go back, you must reflect on the day and day to pray for purifying your soul that has been corrupted by money." Slightly said a word to the Lutheran Chamber of Commerce. Then his eyes fell to the side of the Bolugan who stood there as a puppet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Oufu special envoy came in and only screamed a few times after screaming at the ugly street. Any change. Almost everyone ignored this person as if he had become a strange place here. The bishop's eyes looked at the Oufu's messenger from top to bottom again. The lips seemed to move and seemed to want to say something, but in the end, they didn't open their mouths. They only showed a disgusted look to this clumsy and funny dwarf as disdain for a donkey or mouse. Waste your tongue and energy. Then he stood up and owed a little to Catherine Queen. "I will attend here today. Please let me retire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop The adults are working hard." The Queen smiled and owed a gift. The cardinal turned away with the horsewoman and never looked back at anyone below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the departure of Bishop Esser, the ministers finally recovered their anger and revived in the hall again. It’s just that the Lutheran Chamber of Commerce seems to be a little scared when it’s scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Her Majesty seems to be somewhat interested. She no longer speaks but sighs in the throne and looks slightly outside the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can see what Queen Catherine is thinking at the moment. When the beautiful face of the human fireworks condensed, the fireworks were still unpredictable. After a moment she stood up and said in a somewhat lazy voice: "Come here today." Her gaze swept the following ministers and finally fell on the faces of Luther Chamber of Commerce and Bolugan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people have been standing in the same way as the Chamber of Commerce’s face, and the special envoy is a silly and funny image. Queen Catherine gave a very complicated expression to the two men and smiled and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the important and unparalleled interview ended like this. The ministers are all a bit stunned. Many people have also taken care of the president and special envoys and want to continue to talk to them about some of the issues concerning Oufu. However, the Chamber of Commerce’s absent-minded and special envoys are also a silly image. So the ministers dispersed like this. The Chamber of Commerce and the Special Envoy also left under the leadership. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Catherine sat alone on the lounge chair and thoughtfully looked through the carefully manicured shrubs and flowers in the distant chamber. The large hall of the church at such a distance seems to be small, but the carving on the top of the main entrance can still be seen clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marble carving on the top of the main hall door is a cross between two different swords. One of the swords is powerful and symbolizes the highest secular power while the other sword is sacred and solemn symbolizes the highest religious power. It was the greatest king of Erasia who was engraved at the time of construction. At that time, with the help of the church, he extended Erasia, which was originally a small country, to the point where it is today. The king gave a piece of land called Celest to the church's then Pope Gerasius I and helped establish the Glory Castle, the headquarters base that the church has been handed down to date. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of these two swords is exactly the same. It is even more difficult to reflect the intimacy of the royal power and the theocratic power at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sculpture nature will never change but the situation will never change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A light cough pulled the Queen’s thoughts back. General O'Ling came over from the flower path and bowed down to the Queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the female knight already out alone?" The Queen did not faintly ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. She asked me about the situation of the thieves in my case and did not ask any followers or ask me anything. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen thought about it and asked, "Do you think she can really annihilate those thieves?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Every dinosaur knight is the genius chosen by the church, and the genius of the martial arts is also impeccable. Any country will be the weapon of the country's pillars. Since the bishops let her go alone, she must have his own grasp." General Oling lightly coughed and gasped, and his face had a little noticeable smile. . "But other thieves have not been so good, but the Shamu group is not so good, especially for young people like her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen nodded and said: I heard that the Shamuthi thieves group is good and the yin and sorrow can still escape under your clearing. I heard that I have recently started trading in slaves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes. They don't know how to catch a few elf women. They all sold high prices."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whether it is the church or the country's law slaves It’s illegal.” The Queen sighed softly. "You go to the ministers who bought the slaves and say hello to this kind of thing, otherwise I can't keep them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the footsteps, a female officer walked quickly to the Queen and said: "The messenger of His Majesty is gone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh. So I fled so quickly?" The Queen was a little surprised. "Don't I say that I watched him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the guards, the messenger has not been out since entering the hotel. Later, some people saw blue inside. The chromatic light was no longer waiting for them to check. I checked the room carefully but didn't have any suspicious traces and didn't know how he ran."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Transfer Scroll. Probably set up a temporary transmission array in Oufu. This escape can be really expensive." The Queen smiled and waved at the female officer. "You go, this is not the fault of the guards. You don't have to punish them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the female officer retired, General Ouling said, "It seems that it should be Kill the guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it. Even the bishops don't bother to do it, how can we kill a clown with great fanfare?" A bit. "Not to mention the fact that people have carefully planned and arranged this action. The performance is done at home, and the contradictions are also found. The contradictions also help us to pick up. It is also seen that the smooth escape is also in the calculation." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Ou Ling sighed heavily and shook his head thoughtfully: "It’s really hard to fight."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
