			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic power is almost as important to the magician as life. Especially in the battle, there is no magic, just like the fish on the chopping board. All magicians should consider the cautiousness of the magic when using magic. It is necessary to let the magic play the biggest killing effect. Unless it is extreme, it is impossible to use its magic power in an attack. net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sedros’s magical attack was indeed a smashing complex, and it’s seamlessly matched with a series of low-level magic by relying on incredible instant and control techniques. It is almost impossible to say that the height of the three magic resistances has been dragged down by the imperial knights who are immune to the middle and lower levels of magic. This is almost the ultimate that a magician can achieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one can think of the art-like spelling that consumes all the magic power is not a delay but a foundation. They are just preludes and preparations for these four little things. Every step is interlocked. There isn't any magic. It's not a good idea to pull the three knights into the trap step by step. Without a fire wall, they will not step on the quicksand and will not be able to evade the three ice when they jump out of the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glory armor's magical resistance and the knight's vindictive mix unless a very high level of attacking magic or spells can cause damage, but no matter what the big spell needs Time is so close, it goes without saying that the long sing of the big mantra is just a sneeze and it is enough to die a hundred times. And it's hard to say that even the oncoming strong bow can be easily escaped by the three players. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when you just jumped out of the quicksand flames and the body was not adjusted, it was completely different when you were blocked by three pieces of ice. . There is two Lancelot in front of Christine and Adriatic. What's more, the role of Han Bingbing is not just to block Lancelot and Christine has already sent a sword and Adellik is even frozen directly. Although it can make him stiff, but the time is half-blinking, but this half-eye is also enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder bombs are enough to blow up an iron statue. Although the Knights of the Temple wearing the Glorious Battlegear are far more sturdy than an iron statue, they are seriously injured under this magic even if they are not dead. At this time, the sacred guardian can certainly block this magic, but the shock caused by the explosion will also throw people out of the long-term to deal with the good opportunity of Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So only Adriatic moved the sacred guardian shield on the glory armor, and a huge white magic shield blocked his body from the back. And the silver light sword of Christine’s hand suddenly stunned and shook his sword to the thunderous bomb in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of the magician is not thrown out of the apple watermelon can be free to take the sword to cut. A little bit of external force will cause the violent magical elements to diverge and the explosion will work. Only the strength and balance of the vindictive power on the sword can be grasped to perfection before the magical fluctuations do not work. Destroy the people who can really use the sword to break the magic in the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy and vindictiveness of using such a sword is not small and Christine may not be one of the three. But after he broke the ice, he seemed to have no hesitation. I waved my sword again. The silvery light flowing on his iron sword is a mixture of white magic and the magic of the magical weapon. It is the best weapon in the magic weapon. It is the most suitable weapon to resist and destroy magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot’s sword is not such a magical weapon but he is definitely one of the three and perhaps the tallest one so he faces two The thunder bombs are only dignified and then the same sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Cedros clearly knows this. Since he dares to risk using his full magical power to make a fortune with a superb magic wand, he will definitely do his best. If you do it, you will die. If it is just a delay, he may use other methods that are more labor-saving and more profitable. But now he and Gru are at an absolute disadvantage. He must be killed and killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the body has been tired of the exhaustion of magical power, Cedrus still throws the destroyed wand out of his arms as quickly as possible. A reel unfolds. A lightning bolt with a thick bucket slammed out of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an ordinary lightning magic is the same as the thunder bombs. The goal of Cedros is also one of the three, but a splash of water and fog around them. It was the magical collision of the ice and the fire that was created by the knights of the Knights of the Temple and the burning fire wall behind them. The fog was very thick and almost equal to the three people. In the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning bolts of the buckets are on the rain and the sounds of the countless sounds and currents are superb together and deafening. The ocean of countless tiny lightnings completely covered the body of the three knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scattered chain lightning power is not too big but it is unstoppable. Edrick and Christine can feel the numbness and tingling from the ears, nose and mouth, and every pore outside the body, drilling through each nerve and every muscle and the first muscle fiber in the body. I have to go to the top of my mind to make a difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this does not cause much substantial harm to them, this paralysis and pain is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christine’s action is instantly out of tune, and the shovel’s sword is also smashed. Although this sword is very suitable for dealing with magic, it is only suitable, but it is not possible to touch it anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Guardian shield in front of Adriatic also disappeared. This must be done by the control of the Knights of the Temple. If he attaches the sacred guardian to the surface of the body, this lightning can't hurt him. Unfortunately, he condenses it into a shield to resist the thunder bombs in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the expected explosion of thunder bombs was not born because of Lancelot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white light on Lancelot suddenly flourished while using the scrolls in Cedros. Only he has enough reaction to use the divine guardian in this millennial moment. The white light that covers the whole body is like a sturdy embankment, and the countless golden snakes around it are still stunned. At the same time, Lancelot's figure also suddenly turned to Adelik and Christine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The degree of Lancelot before this. It looks like it doesn't make much difference with the other two. However, this sudden change to his figure immediately turned into a white residual image can avoid the two immediately to the body of the Thunderbolt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros also had a point when shooting a thunderbolt. He first faced Lancelot and the two were against Edrick and Christine, so the thunderballs in front of them were a little slower. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white figure gallops in the ocean built by golden lightning, just like a thick ink on the golden canvas, it instantly pulls out a white band of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white light with a little bit of human figure in the middle instantly passed in front of Edric and Christine. The electro-optic ocean that has been mutated by the chain of lightning has faded in the middle of the gap, witnessing the swiftness of this figure. Similarly, there is a deep trench in the ground where the white figure on the ground passes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken thunderball turned into a simple magical element that dissipated in the air and some hit the Knight of the Temple for inertia. The white light has been restored to Lancelot not far from Adriatic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly stopped. The white light on Lancelot's sword shattered his tired face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two thunder bombs that did not hit Lancelot continued to fly backwards and the Cardinal behind the Lancelot A group of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Adela has just taken his eyes back from the wounded Talis and Jarvis and woke up from Gruard’s earth-shattering hand. come. His combat experience is too weak compared to other people here. Almost until this time he realizes that he should join the battle as soon as possible. But the raging fire wall was coming to him with two thunderous bombs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Return to the original with the glory of the Lord." Adela raised his hand and pointed a white light from his hand on a thunderous bomb. The thunder ball above the white light, like the snowball under the scorching sun, disappeared in an instant. Although his strain and response are probably not enough, after all, being a cardinal magic level is still difficult for other magicians. This advanced magical spell is too clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but only a thunder bomb was dissolved. There is still a fly away from the Arad bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wellske’s bow is a tiny arrow carved by magic crystal. The bowstring and the loose crystal arrow shot suddenly shattered in a thundering thunderball, and the last thunder bomb with the splashing crystal fragments shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros is already retracing but his figure is too slow compared to the Knights of the Temple. Christine's silver sword light followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aidlik did not rush to Cedros but rushed to Gru. Although he has no weapons and still engraves the horror of this opponent, he must go up and drag the time for Christine to fight to kill his opponent. The one must remove one of the Paladins who had dealt with the three Knights of the Knights at such a close distance and even forced the Megatron 6 to use the Holy Guardian to do their best to save the two. It would be horrible for such a mage to let him have a chance to breathe away whether he is an opponent or an auxiliary support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out of the way." Gru almost didn't even look at Edric and gave him a punch. Edric is also a boxing out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Double fists hit each other with a loud bang and swayed back two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adriatic is a three-step retreat. The shape of the fist is not much like a fist. But he didn't even turn around and continued to rush to Gru. Although he is not an opponent of Gru and has no weapons, but as a Knight of the Temple, he is desperate to drag Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the silver wave of the general Jianguang has been rolled up in front of Cedrus, and Cedros is already far away. Except for the magic, he is just an ordinary old man. Although he still has dozens of auxiliary magic on his body, it is not a force of a hand-free chicken. But under the sword of the Knights of the Temple, he and a chicken are not much worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Killing such a brilliant magician makes Christine somewhat excited. He can almost feel the hand of the old body under the sword. He has no doubt about the lethality of his sword. At the time of Nigan, this sword once divided the huge Minotaurs into two. He could clearly see that the original spirit of Sedros's original face was slightly distorted under the fear of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru and Edrick hit each other again with two punches. Now these two people are not fighting at all, but just attacking all defenses. Gru then stepped back two steps and leached blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aidlik did not retreat. But the blood in his mouth and nostrils is not dip or flowing. It is spraying. And he even sheds blood on his eyes and nose. The bloody battle armor now seems to have become two ordinary depressions in the middle of the ordinary bargain. Even if you don't understand the human body structure, you can see that he has broken at least ten ribs. And half of it was inserted into the internal organs. The key is that he continues to stand still and can watch Gru's fighting posture with the eyes and fighting spirit of killing at least ten cows. It is only from the appearance that he is completely inseparable from the noble and noble and mighty gods. Instead, it is like an undead creature that has just been made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop." A small voice on the periphery exclaimed. But this voice will undoubtedly never let Christine's upcoming sword recover. The situation seems to be a foregone conclusion. Gru’s being dragged to Cedros seems to have died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time the situation suddenly reversed or was unexpectedly reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword did not fall on Cedrus, but it was a shrill iron wire, and the body shape of Christine suddenly fell. come back. When he landed, his figure also covered his hand and the painful color of his face. The original high-necked nose seems to have broken and the blood is constantly flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to deal such damage to the Knights of the Shrine is not a bare-handed Cedros. But now a person standing next to Cedros. But not only Christine and Lancelot looked at this person with an incredible expression and even Cedrus was amazed. This person is amazed by Asa who has been squatting on the ground like a pile of rubbish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm sorry to be late." Asa apologetically looked at the unsettled Cedros. Pull a tooth embedded in the flesh from your forehead. That is the Knights of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sedros sighed and touched his forehead and the head there was broken a lot under the Jianguang. The feeling of just coming back from the ghost gate is really very relaxing. He showed a little weird expression to Asa. "It’s too late to be late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christine looked Asa’s eyes are not only more amazed but more angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
