			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey." The female officer around Queen Catherine couldn't help but laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf special envoy of a gorgeous costume rolled over the steps of the tenth step, and the short, short, short but short head but the head was big and he looked like a paragraph. The wood almost slammed into the ground and slammed into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were several ministers who couldn’t help but laughed but thought that this was the Queen’s House of Deputies and they were very busy. From the idyllic dwarf into the hall, the original solemn and somewhat oppressive atmosphere became a bit funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you okay?" The Lutheran Chamber of Commerce, who was originally in front of the Bolugan adults, hurried down the stairs to help the generals who had fallen nose and swollen face. It’s just because the disparity in height seems to be that adults are helping children. So the scene that was a little funny was even more funny. Even the Knights of the Temple, who had always looked calm and ice-like, couldn’t help but smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old face of Luther Chamber of Commerce has become popular. Originally, he attached great importance to the incomparable and ambitious approach to the palace, but he did not think of a big joke. Many of the ministers and nobles who knew his mind were laughing more comfortably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president of the business has always been quite concerned about his status. Elazia's economic prosperity and political enlightenment, as the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the whole country, led the pursuit of nature on the national folk merchants' gold coins. It is of little significance. Even if you make more money, you can even bribe officials to influence a lot of decrees, but in the end, you are just a public. It is undoubtedly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to enter the palace to see the Queen. Although it is not a good thing to discuss things, as long as you can cope with the extraordinary vision before the Queen, you can handle this thing properly. It is very likely that it will be appreciated by the Queen’s Majesty and the title of the aristocrat. But I think that when I come in, I am so big and ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ambassador stood up under the help of the Chamber of Commerce, but a nosebleed on his forehead also rolled out from the big nostrils. He hurriedly tore off the corner of the cloak that had been torn. The laughter in the hall is more obvious. A minister turned and quietly said to his companion: "I think it might be more appropriate to ask this person to be a court clown."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The president of the Chamber of Commerce was full of sweat and hurriedly said: "Please allow me to lead the special envoy to organize the appearance and come back......."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s all right. Mr. Special Envoy must have thought about it.” Her Majesty smiled. The thin, thin red lips are gently tilted upwards. The smiles in the eyes are not too many, but it seems to be a bit mysterious. The taste of the mirage is like a mirage in the desert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh...oh yeah...." The Chamber of Commerce only saw the Queen’s eyes and immediately rushed to nod. Immediately, I thought that I should ask the Special Envoy to quickly and bow down and ask: "Mr. Special Envoy....Would you like...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to be like this." Lugan’s adults smashed their big faces and ignored the chaos on the head. They continued to walk toward the main hall on the steps. The Chamber of Commerce was careful to follow his back this time, but he did not fall again. This time, the special envoys mentioned their cloaks and looked up like a peasant woman who walked through the water and lifted her own skirt. This action led to a repressed laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the Lutheran Chamber of Commerce who looked at the swaying head in front of him only felt that his head seemed to be bigger than the big head. The head like a bird's nest is tenacious than the original one. It is thick and hard, and even the fake cover can't be put on, so that the makeup artist suspects that this is a weird fake made with animal hair. It took a lot of special oils on this head to make a slightly pleasing shape. Now it has changed back to the prototype and even more evil. Adding to the wrinkled and gorgeous clothes after wrestling, how funny and how funny it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most magnificent and magnificent palace on the 6th floor of the Palace of the West of Erasia. It is the most powerful and perhaps the most beautiful woman. The heir to the great royal family. Listening to the surrounding laughter, the light flashed every expression because of the convulsion of holding back the laughter. Luther Chamber of Commerce has not dared to go to the Queen again. He only feels empty in his head and just wants to scream. If it weren’t for the shameful Dwarf, the people sent by Cedros were seen in Cedros and Oufu. It might be that in the future, it might be the largest Fortuna of the Erasia Chamber of Commerce and the five hundred that I just received. After the gold coins and the one thousand gold coins promised afterwards, he bet that he would immediately go out of the palace and immediately find a knife to kill the shameful two knives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the hundreds of kings did not add up to the center of the throne. The man was more temperate and more able to look up. She was just sitting there in the whole hall and the glory and glory gathered on her alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe a woman can be more beautiful than her, more delicate than her skin, better than her body, or even more feminine, dignified, and more holy in her temperament. No woman can be more attractive than her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she is the queen of the Kingdom of Erasia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her one-handed gesture, one laugh, one breath, one of the most subtle movements, can express a woman’s good looks and more. There is also the gentleness of the king's majestic and sane wise man. These traits blended with each other and naturally emerge through her violent anger. Perhaps other beautiful women can describe a sculpture of a gem or jade. But whoever looks at her will not feel like just looking at a beautiful thing or even a woman. At the same time, there are other things that are more eye-catching than the charm of a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Creator can't make such a woman. Her charm is not only natural but also concise in the essence of countless worldly customs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next to her is a robes of the Elasian Cardinal Escher. The bishop, who is in charge of the largest parish of the 6th National Congress of the University of West Asia, is not only laughing at the hall. Only he did not show a little smile on the comic performance of the Oufu messenger. The sacred majesty and temperament of the clergy, commensurate with his identity, contrasts with the charm of Her Majesty the Queen. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Bishop Esshir had asked the political affairs for quite a few times, but it was not a matter of interviewing foreign envoys, but he was only worried about this time. Significance. After all, the church is more hostile to the orc city than to Erasia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop is standing behind a heroic knight. The height of the taller than the average male is a tight-fitting knight. The body of the slender body will show off the body of a slender body. The faint sigh of the cold and ice-like expression makes her beautiful and handsome face look like some men and women. Identify. It was the youngest of the nine Knights of the Temple who had just come from the Big 6 in the town of Seychelles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All ministers are side by side. It is of great importance to meet with the Oufu messenger this time. Although in general, because of the attitude of the church, the war is probably only a matter of time. However, there are still many people who still hold peace opinions and even hope that the ambassadors of Oufu can use the method of turning around the lotus to convince the Queen of the Queen to restore trade relations between the two countries. After all, Oufu is also very helpful to the economy of Erasia. No one wants to go out with the golden coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people report some hostility and alert. Others are reporting that they are all nervously waiting for this messenger from the orc's lair. But no one thought that it was such a funny dwarf that made the guards laugh and the expectant was disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bolugan and the Lutheran Chamber of Commerce came to the ceremony. The Lutheran Chamber of Commerce suddenly spoke to the Queen of Catherine, who was just before he could talk. The low voice is steady and grand in the hall, like the taste of the majesty. "This man is just a public. How can I come to the temple to discuss the national affairs? And I heard that these businessmen also provided a lot of help to them when they were founded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the president of the business is immediately green and the bottom of the heart is dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chamber of Commerce of Erasia has been secretly sponsoring the business from the time of the establishment of Oufu, and has always hoped that there will be a place for commercial gathering in the wilderness. It is also a great convenience and protection for the transaction that Cedros promises to give them. This matter is quite secret, I don’t think that the main church of Eszter knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Queen’s Majesty smiled and said: “That’s all before, and they’re just doing it to make more money. It’s the merchant’s There is nothing wrong with it. And Luther’s president has led the merchants of Erasia to play an important role in the economy and material circulation of the country. I have always wanted to meet him so I specially called him today. And he’s on Oufu’s The situation is most clear to us. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Han Xia Ming Jian." Lutheran Chamber of Commerce grateful to 几乎 almost immediately tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let’s talk about the recent inferiority of the beasts of Oufu." The Queen’s eyes were clear and the water was shining like a sword. The face of the great Bolugan. "If you let me come, you will have something to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
