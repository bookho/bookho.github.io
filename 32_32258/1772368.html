			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majestic day is now like a fragile glassware being slammed with a sledgehammer, shattered and collapsed into countless small The fragments, and then the fragments fell into the air and fell into a myriad of white light spots. After the rise, the light rain slowly spread into the entire shining castle, and the pure white magic melted open.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the same as the white light rain that the angels have summoned before the battle of the phoenix. This time, the light rain that the angels themselves have made is stronger and stronger. The majestic white magic swayed into the space. If it weren't for the murderous beast of the orc, the flames of the swords rising and slashing around the flames, this holy and full of peace and vitality is like a paradise<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pudu sentients?" Stephen's eyes were picked. "...the meteor fire, the guardian angel, the door of the different dimension... Today, the eyes are not too shallow to see the four legendary top magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inha Mum said: "This is the opportunity I have been waiting for, please do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephen did not move the knowledge to see the light rain all over the sky A smile: "Is even Magnus finally desperately using this white magic curse is in your expectation? I really admire you... I have never admired a person like this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where he actually survived to completely resist the meteor fire, he could destroy the door of the different dimension. This is beyond my medical care. In fact, I thought he would give I have to use my strength to use Pudu sentient beings." Because Ham's voice is already a little anxious. "Please also ask Teacher Stephen, you can go to Magnus. It seems that the oil has dried up. This time, the life of the Purdue will not last long. I will go right to you right away..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can rest assured that no problem." Stephen smiled and turned to walk to the basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inham took a deep look at Stephen's back and turned to the other direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven soon returned to the basement. Javey is still lying on the bed, and the two Necromancers are also piled in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the air in this basement is filled with the rich white magic of the Purdue beings. This is a single curse of white magic. Far from any white magician's healing spells. At this time, it is necessary to burn the life of the magic test itself to use the ultimate range of treatment. Now it is the use of the great angels and the white magic to use the top ten hundred popes. The magic power of the test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archangel is no longer in the Pope. This magic has no manipulation by the caster. But the majestic white magic that permeates the space still continues. These forces will resonate with the white magic to automatically heal any wound on the body. As long as the dead are not in the face of such a huge cure system curse can be restored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this environment, it is of course easy to complete the transformation of Jarvis. All the vitality in Jarvis's body was stunned by Sandru, and even the Pudu sentient beings could not be automatically healed. But there is a necromancer who is good at the human body. That is another matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Stephen frowned and looked at Javy and he did not hurry and hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Hem, this person, although he knows it for a few days, but knows it is definitely not a hand. From the mouths of other Necromancers, I learned that the actions of the younger generation who had served as the acting president will be described in a word. And through everything that I just saw in the square. His impression is deeper and deeper: it is unfathomable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s obviously impossible to be born, but in his close arrangements, he’s really able to go as he wishes and he’s I have never stood before the stage to attract attention. And he always seems to have no position and no special ** or direction to capture the person who seems to be able to do whatever he wants to do, as long as the opportunity is allowed, and he may do whatever he wants, and it is not a People who are reassuring. As an ally, they are only using each other and cooperating with each other. If you become an enemy in the future, you will be even more unbearable. Even if this person is going to deal with you, you will never let you know. When you know it, it’s the last minute you know it’s useless.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his son to be healed is by no means a fuel-efficient lamp. After that, I have a relationship with him and his mutual use. It is hard to say anything later.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a way." A voice suddenly sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Stephen slammed like a cat with a knife on his ass, and his movements were completely disproportionate to his age. Ups and downs around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs in the square have just woke up from the shock of the angel’s sword, and the miraculous power is just to make them a little bit of a slap The wrath was scattered in all directions to cover the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang, the priest of the Temple of Light, knocked on a huge crystal bell. It was the bell that was specially used for help after the establishment of the Glorious Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell is loud and it is impossible to pass Celeste. But in the cathedrals of various countries, including the School of Magic, there is a big clock that can resonate with it. At the moment, it is also making loud noises. As long as you hear this bell, all the elite troops of the religious country will use the fastest time to come to Celest to come here and it will be the army of 100,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the fastest part of the 100,000 army will only come after half a day. At this time, the Glorious Castle has become a piece of Shura Purgatory, and all the screaming orcs of the screaming corpses are all bloody and smashed. Even the holy light rain of the Purdue beings, which has been maintained in the sky, does not weaken the bloody and suffocating atmosphere that pervades the entire Glorious Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the door of the Dimension is interrupted by the Archangel, but there are already large orcs and barbarians who have crossed the door of space and came to the square. Under the dispatch and arrangement of the Bolugan adults, the troops used the fastest and most efficient way and all the first to enter were the most elite and powerful orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc's weapons are all powerful. The big knife in the hands of Luken's nails is more slender and slender. If you cut a knife, if the opponent's strength is enough, the weapon is hard enough and usually can withstand a little bit. It is just a knife that is cut off and the weapon is broken. The huge meteor hammers and chain shackles in the hands of other werewolves are heavy weapons that the sword can't resist at all. Usually, the people in the past are directly a flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of ogres wrapped in steel shovel are completely mobile fortresses. Although the movement is not fast, the swordsmen priests are completely unable to block half an inch. The armor has been able to withstand all attacks except the Knights of the Temple. The bloodthirsty and ferocious nature of these monsters has been completely stimulated. The huge warhammers and tomahawks that screamed in the hands of hundreds of kilograms waved unscrupulously as long as they were smashed and smashed into pieces or completely deformed and flew out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two particularly tall ogres who don’t focus on the eccentric magic wands they have in their hands in the middle of the ogre. . At this time, Oufu trained the Ogre Wizard in this short time. With the help of these two wizards, the other reloading ogres are even more devastating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hang" A thunder bomb exploded on the head of an ogre's armor and the head of the armor was blown up like a firework. The huge body of the ogre without head continues to rush forward and stumbled and beaten the two rounds of the blood that rushed to the neck and rushed out of the distance. Only high-level magic can effectively damage this monster under heavy protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this high-level wizard of high-level magic also exposed his body shape. Two werewolves and lizards rushed straight past. Finally, the magic test has gathered around a dozen swordsmen and priests to arrive, and then the magician thundered a bomb and blows an ogre to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two bulls rushed from the slanting times to protect the magician's dozens of swordsmen. The magician was trampled under the hooves without even wailing. Then the half-orc on the cow pulled a reins and a yellow corrosive gas erupted from the mouth of the two cattle. Two swordsmen rushed up and screamed and rolled around the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This giant animal of up to two meters, although herbivores, is not an opponent of the ogre, let alone humans. These tamed animals were rampant in the Glorious Castle and rushed into the tall buildings to trample the priests inside and smash them into the walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two Bimeng, although not fully grown up, have five or six meters of height and the invincible claws are enough to tear any armor. Under the command of the Orc Trainer, the giant claws were swept around and the swordsmen and priests were scattered and discarded in front of the behemoth like waste paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
