			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled and said, "There is something important. Actually, I was only prepared to ask you about the whereabouts of a person, but now it seems that It seems that there is no such thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai’s mother-in-law’s heart will smile and say, “Let’s talk alone, let your two little girls wait a little outside. Etc..<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis looked at Ai’s mother-in-law, snorted and turned and pulled Ai Mei to go outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the two men’s steps, Aier’s mother-in-law was at the table, and Asa also came over and sat down on the other side of the table. In the professors of more than ten years, both of them sat at the two ends of the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come, this is the buckwheat bread of Reed in the village. You haven’t tasted it for several years.” Ai’s mother-in-law just put herself at the table. Take out a loaf of bread to Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa bites and swallows and smiles and says: "Frankly, his craft is still so bad. But in your mother-in-law, it seems that everything is fragrant. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his childhood, except for his home, this is the only place where you can get a rest and get food. In particular, almost every time I come here, after cultivation, I can eat especially. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can’t think of it... time flies. I remember that you were just as tall as the table, it seems that it’s just so high in a blink of an eye. It’s so powerful. "Ai's mother-in-law looked at Asa and sighed. She closed her eyes and thought about it. It seemed to recall the appearance of his childhood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I am more unexpected." Asa sighed and looked at the old woman who was already familiar with it. "I really didn't think that you, the one who looked at me, was the one that Sander wanted me to find, the leader of the former adventurer's union, the other former agent of Diya Valley, Ai Ruilier. "Yes. I am Ai Greel. I haven't heard the name for a long time." Ai's mother nodded and said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa took a long sigh of relief, although he had already guessed it, but he still felt extremely shocked after hearing it. Before returning to here, he vaguely knew that this old man who had been teaching himself since childhood would never be a simple retirement adventurer. The skills, combat skills, knowledge, and many other things that are taught to you. It is not something that ordinary people can have. So when there was no news of Ai Ruiruil everywhere, Asa thought of her. Since she has so many experiences and experiences, she must not be an ordinary person before, so it is possible to know the trace of the first killer and adventurer in the seclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when I get back here, I have some weird feeling when I look at this cottage again with his current eyes. And when Talis recognized those unusual collections, especially after the half of the scepter. He has to think about this possibility. Finally, when he heard the voice of Ai's mother-in-law who came from behind, he was sure. Being able to approach himself at any time without being aware of it can be sneaked at any time. Apart from the legendary mainland first killer, he really can't think of anyone else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But... I didn’t hear that Egrenair was a woman when I went to the Rogue Trade Union and the Adventurers’ Union.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai’s mother said with a smile: “My time as the leader of the adventurer’s trade union union is to show people as a man. You know, a bunch of rough big men are not big. I am willing to let a woman be the leader."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is the strangest thing... Since Shaddy knows you, why haven’t you said a little clue? I just told me to come out and look for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai’s mother’s face was a little surprised, she asked: “You didn’t know it before. My identity? How did you find it yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Didn’t you hear that I learned the young officer who came here to investigate you? What do you think? I thought that after you heard about this, I contacted my appearance at the Duke’s Mansion at that time. It should be somewhat suspicious. At least Shande. I should know that I am right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also fully understand that the man on the Duke’s house is actually you, no wonder Sandrand responds. Blame, even after the question, whoever asks is not to mention who you are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is he guilty? He will also be guilty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These things you have time to ask him will not know." Ai's mother-in-law smiled very much. Some flaws. She then looked at her eyes again. "The young officer who was taught by me at the time, I also watched you in the ducal palace. Why, he was broken by my hand. Didn’t anyone talk about this thing?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this happening? I have never heard of it. Sandru does not know what it looks like, or else I should tell me how much I came out this time." Asa shook his head. He already understood that the young man in the mouth of Ai’s mother was Rod Hart. But when he was too busy at the time of Wang Du, he had no time to talk to Rhodes. I haven't heard of it in the future. "Somewhat strange...." Ai's mother-in-law thought about it and didn't have a clue, but it was just a trivial little detail compared to the immediate situation. She shook her head and said to Asa: "Forget it, since you are here, you are all the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sandra wants me to ask you for something.. ...." Asa took out the pocket filled with the sun well water from her arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The thing that can lock this thing, he said it should be here. And he wants you to find a place to collect."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The thing he wants is not here." Ai's mother shook her head and pointed at Asa. "It's with you. Sandru hasn't seen this stuff. It's not surprising that I can't recognize it. But I have to say that he is really too big. "I am here? "Asa is awkward.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, you have been in your hand. What I originally meant to you was to let you solve it yourself. The result is still to trouble me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai's mother extended her finger and clicked on Asa's hand. Her fingers were slender and there was no wrinkles on it, just like the girl's hand. Only the young and beautiful fingers pointed at the ring of Asa’s finger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance outside the hut, Talis and Ayimei Waiting under the big tree. Ai Mei's face is calm, and Talis's face is full of anger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's your two small girl? Are we still their accessories? "Talis suddenly spoke loudly<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said. It seems that until now, I can spit out the sigh in my chest. Ai Meimei asked in surprise: "Is your sister, do you care about this? But why did you just pull me out without a word, I thought you didn't care. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does it mean? This is an insult to the knight. "Talis's face was red, but she sighed again. "I just came out, the old woman was too powerful, I felt breathless in front of her." "No, I don't feel that she has any great feelings. It's just an ordinary old woman." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ordinary? Humph. "Talis coldly snorted. "If it wasn't for me that I was really inconvenient to return to Celeste now, and look at the kid's share, I went to call the teacher and all the Knights of the Temple." Her expression eyes were all squirmed because of anger and confusion, etc.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I must ask what she meant by those words." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not saying, is this when my father put me on me? "Asa took off her finger on the ring. His expression is not doubtful, it is calm, he feels that this problem may not be just as simple as surprise.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Ai's mother said faintly: "I am on you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, did you see me first? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai's mother-in-law suddenly took a moment and said with a smile: "You can say that." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that there must be another saying, but Asa did not ask this, he also knows whether he is afraid or not. Willing. He just asked: "So, this thing has nothing to do with me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Related. Do you need this thing now? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I mean, this thing has nothing to do with my life?" Asa hesitated and asked carefully, he felt his heart is jumping and jumping very fast. His heart has not skipped so fast for a long time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
