			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On this night, the old man wants to exhaust me?" Asa looked up at the stars and the new crescent-shaped crescent Mumbled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few such stars in such a clear night sky, who seem to be who smashed huge gemstones and smashed the crescent moon in the night. Hanging there seems to be something that I want to hook up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king has to be noisy, but at least the Magic Academy is still quiet on the top of the cathedral. The side of the half pot of wine alone quietly facing the sky and the moon is very quiet and leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement with Cedros has been completed and finally restored to freedom. It hasn't been so leisurely for a long time. how long? One year or two years? But this leisure seems to be only this night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very reassuring that Sandrue came back from Deva Valley safely and Roland’s head and Otaru did not mention the one they wanted to know about the dungeon. The true purpose of the things in them will not become very weird. I don’t know what happened. I just started to prepare myself to leave tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I know that it’s unfair to you to push this all over to you, but I can only do it. In the end, are you helping me or I will help you in short... You ask for more blessings." Sandru finally looked at him inexplicably and said this strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it’s really self-seeking. If it really works. After bringing that thing to the designated place for collection, perhaps all the disputes will come to a big step. Just how far this road will be. How long can I go? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it is. In short, it is going step by step. This is not a helpless choice but to know how to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death of the separation is lost and lonely... These can make people feel horrible and unconsciously escape. However, what I got after I was calmly faced with the feeling of being practical was that people who were able to face their own roads to go step by step had a sense of loneliness and self-reliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this night's leisure? The slightest drunkenness made the consciousness a little vague. There was nothing on the top of the church on the hundred meters. There is only the innocent night sky of yourself and the sky. The night wind scorns that night sky is that it is the night sky. Starlight is not like starlight, the cells in your body sing in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;舒畅. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And loneliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he is away, he doesn’t want to chat with anyone. Instead, he came alone to the height of this hundred meters to drink against the stars of the sky. I don't know because those responsibilities and feelings are not shared at all, or because I have long been accustomed to this loneliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously touched the little urn that he had brought around his waist. Inside is the one who has accompanied him to give him the most warmth during this time. But even then, the two of them even don't even know each other's previous experiences to share. It just seems to be just the same way and seems to have some warmth. And she eventually died because of herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;小懿. The hope that originally occupied the most places in the heart is nothing but the yearning for the mirror. She now has too much responsibility. After all, they are only gradually drifting away on two different roads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the end is exhausted... Or is it that people are lonely from the beginning? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa lay down and poured a large sip of wine. This is the strongest and most spicy wine. It seems that a group of fire has poured into the chest and abdomen from the throat, and it has a lot of fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some footsteps that climbed onto the roof of the cathedral. Asa looked back and saw the starry sky and the moonlight saw a tall figure coming over and a gold fluttering in the night wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you dare to sit on the sacred and solemn cathedral to drink?" Talis looked at him. come over. "You make me look good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is precisely because of this that Talis is almost completely unclear about the cause and effect of this incident. In the end, she was almost completely ignorant of how Jiawei’s bishop was caught. In the past two days, Asa did not pay any attention to her. She allowed her to go to the magic school and the big gods to swear. Anyway, the great priests knew that there was not much need to let her know too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis went to Asa’s side and looked at him and asked: "You tell me what is going on here? Bishop Jia Wei wants to think about it." How? What happened to you? How did I feel that there was another strong dark magic wave in the Royal Palace..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not answer She just patted her side and said, "Don't you stand tired? Sit down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't give me a set of almost I am asking you... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You block me to see the moon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...you... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis looked at him and finally sat down beside him. Ask again: "Is the big priest here at the School of Magic all old confused? One question is three, I don’t know how to be stubborn. I’m still jailed. After the guy was arrested, the pope, who actually blamed everything, actually insinuated that I was also a pope. What kind of accomplice I came to, I almost cut a sword with him... You told me what is going on here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the matter..." Sa snorted repeatedly and smiled bitterly. "Even I don't know very well what this is all about..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...that you told me one by one at the time What's in there? I heard that Bishop Jia Wei has blocked the place twice and then went in and didn't know what to do. The Knights of the Palat also blocked it here. Ask those guys to ask questions. I don't know if I have any weirdness." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa didn’t open her mouth and just took a sip of the wine. Seeing that Talis is going to do this, he lazily replies: "...you don't know what to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You still go back to Celeste. My people don't want you to pay any more. How? Earn it?" Asa put the jug in the jug The last bite of wine drunk and muttered. "I have some experience now or I don’t know much about it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I must know." The voice of Talis and the saga of Asa On the contrary, it seems that it is powerful to use only this tone to break the jade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you stay here and slowly know, I will leave here tomorrow. But I advise you not to be too curious and don't ask too much. They can Turn a cardinal into a crippled and idiot and send it back to Celeste to believe that the Knights of the Temple who don't mind sending a disabled idiot will go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You... "Talis seems to want to fire but seems to feel that it is really only to look at Asa and ask: "Where are you going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's none of your business." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to follow you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to follow you." Talis glared at Asa and said with a firmer tone than she had just said that she would cut him apart. broken. "I feel that what you are going to do is definitely related to everything that is born here. Since I can't see any name here, I will follow you all the time. If you don't say it, I will use my own eyes to see if this is What's going on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have to follow me all the time?" Asa looked at Talis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple resolutely nodded again with a tone similar to the oath: "I will follow you all the time. I tell you that you don't want to escape. My teacher has followed me." Even the rabbits in a wilderness don't want to run away..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very soft, gentle and warm smile. He felt that he had never laughed like this. He felt like he was not laughing. He used a face to open a very gentle and warm flower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
