			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa slowly woke up from the sun rising from the foothills in the morning when the first light was thrown over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shines on the face, and even the tiniest hair seems to stretch slowly like all the grass around me, including all the cells in my body. Bring the vitality and vitality out to prepare for this new day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa didn’t blink and didn’t move. He liked it so much that he felt like a small part of the natural world around him. The senses have been extended into nature. No points to each other. Even if you don't look at him, you can hear a lot of voices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint mist in the forest is slowly dissipating the sound. The sun is hitting on the grass. The sound of the grass grows. The sound of the grass grows. A group of ants are carrying the bugs. The sound of rest in his own nest is not far away. A small lizard swallows the sound of a moth. The two small animals on the tree are fighting. The sound of a lyre bird flies over the sky. The sound of the wings of a fan is called four or five wild birds. The sound of the footsteps of the people slowly approaching is slowly being cut open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person’s footsteps are very light and the footsteps of the two squirrels on the tree are almost at the same time. They are all looking for those who have no grass and debris. The place that will cause any sound. This person's breathing is also very slight and not the slightest deliberate suppression. It is the slightness that has controlled every part of the body naturally and naturally. Only by this breath can you be sure that this person is at least one of the best in the military. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air near the breath of this person is slowly being slowly broken by a sharp blade, and the faint humming is almost inaudible. This is definitely a good sword, at least casually. You can easily cut a man's head with a sword in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of footsteps, the sound of the sword, the sound of the blade, slowly approaching from behind, this is all the traces and even the murderousness is not revealed. Even the most sensitive sika deer may not be aware of it. But the reason why Asa wakes up is because of this voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asacha felt it, but he still kept his original look still closed. He is curious about what this person is doing. Although the weapon on the right hand has almost completely explained the problem. But he still wants to see how this person is going to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps reached the position of three meters behind him. The slightest breath was also a slight weight. He knew that the other party was about to shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to hell." The man slammed forward and swooped forward. The sound from the body and hands suddenly became a violent storm from the whispering breeze. It rushed directly toward Asa’s body and seemed to immediately smash him into pieces of minced meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touch the ground. Asa opened his eyes and kissed him. This steep storm suddenly changed direction and flew out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person only slammed on her and squatted and looked at Asa’s eyes and was surprised and unwilling and angry. She shouted: "I Dissatisfied. You are mean! You pretend to fall asleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I did fall asleep, but you woke me up again." Asa shook his head and sighed. Toss the sword to her. "If you can't sleep yourself, why bother to harass me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is going to harass you? I am here to try and catch you." Behind the horsewoman. The golden show of her head was smeared with a soft glow wrapped around her body. She did not wear heavy armor but a light-weight light-skinned slender body. Although it seems to lack a bit of feminine charm, it is more heroic and hearty. But her current expression is very painful. Her face is full of regrets and puzzles. "How could this be? But this guy was not my opponent a few months ago, but now I can't do it." How can this be the case? Is my skill regressing to such a point?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sneak attack?" Asa stunned. "If you really want to sneak out what your ghost called 'death'? I thought you were joking with me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who and you This bastard is joking? Bright and honest, this is the Cavaliers’ basic code of sneak attack. It’s very important that I’m screaming when I’m shooting.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since you have already called 'go to death', why use the hilt to knock my head?" Asa asked again. Just when he kicked a fly, Talis took her long sword and saw that the sword in her hand was not stabbing or squatting, but instead gripping his face with force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already served the service..." Asa nodded and said. "I wonder why you have no murderousness and doubt that you can completely conceal and hide your own murderousness. It should already be the realm of your teacher Lancelot..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it really that I have regressed? How is it possible? It’s not as good as Javin’s kid now.” Talis shook her head and squatted slowly. Face disappointment and pain. "The teacher asked me to come out and practice, but how do I feel that I am getting worse and worse? I can't do this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa ignored The distressed female knight climbed up and stretched out, and the whole body of the bones was stretched out for a while. He bent over and made two baked sweet potatoes from the bonfire residue and threw one for Talis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the king’s has been there for some time, the goddess knight seems to be a little bit normal and constantly using various methods to find his own nephew . The first few times were to ask for a positive duel or to use a variety of methods to compare and test this time and actually sneak up. Do not know if it will be poisoned next time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not that I can really be sure that I can deal with her Asa, I really don’t dare to go on the road with such a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Asa also has to admit that it is really not lonely to have such a person together. It is indeed very powerful and interesting to have such a companion on a journey that is supposed to be full of sinister loneliness and loneliness. And at least her combat power is actually quite good. If the true state of mind can mature and be as steady as the other shrine knights, Asa himself has no confidence to eat her. It is never a bad thing to have such a good helper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell me what is going on with you?" The knight who was eating the baked sweet potato looked at Asa. “Why are you getting more and more profitable? I feel that I am getting weaker and weaker? What method do you use to cultivate to become stronger?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I get more and more profitable?" Asa said to himself, and he didn't want to answer. I don't know how to answer it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He really doesn’t know if he is really stronger than before. He just feels that he is more and more serious and serious about facing things. The more you can maintain a calm heart. Although there are also ups and downs, it is also within the limits of what you can control. It’s as if the power of riding a horse is getting bigger and bigger, but the stiff rope is getting more and more tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having this attitude of input. And calmly mentality, those forces that were originally in their own body are more harmonious and more usable. I don't know if I no longer evade those things. I am more willing to delve into the problem of confrontation or the influence of this spiritual team. I really use the power of the body in many places to be more comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of mentality is only after so many helpless sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless battles. Countless choices of their own failures, the passing of the lover and the final parting of the jq. Acceptance of Responsibility... There are countless emotions and sorrows on this road that are unconsciously in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where can you get the strongest exercise? Asa suddenly remembered that she had asked such a question similar to that of the female knight. It was the adventurer Aier, who was retiring after the village began to exercise for her dreams at the age of six or seven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**The skills on the mind are not the strongest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai’s mother smiled and poked her hand on Asa’s heart. Say: Keep walking and slowly enriching people here will be really strong. At that time, I didn't know how to take my mother-in-law's hand to ask the mother-in-law but didn't explain it. It just said that you should understand it when you understand it later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey. I ask you. What are you staying?" Talis throws a piece of sweet potato on Asa’s face. "Do you think I am regressing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa caught the sweet potato and threw it away. A faint smile said: "In fact, you have not regressed strictly. Have your temperament weakened? Is your hands and feet sore? Is the magic power exhausted? Have you been hurt so badly? Nothing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you said that I have a problem?" Talis was anxious to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
