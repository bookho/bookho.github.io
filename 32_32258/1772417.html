			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been waiting for you, do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Asa rushed into that one The group heard such a sentence in the darkness of the king of the dead. He is stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not just this sentence that makes him hold it, although the sentence itself is enough for him to hold on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru’s earth-shattering arrow shot with the phantom bow broke the darkness of the substance. He and his body flew into this darkness, what a terrible sight, the king of the dead, how horrible the monster is, he was prepared, but he did not see anything terrible, only saw a gray man standing in the middle of the road Say such a sentence to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness around has been re-closed. But this darkest black center is not black in the darkness of all the sea of ​​the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no exceptions here. The darkness only formed a closed space around it. From the outside, it was black and black. It was as calm as the typhoon. And it is a truly pure kind of almost nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full-body gray man standing in the center of a gray smoke condenses on his body to form an armor. His look is as empty as the surrounding, but he doesn't seem to have much abnormality. Except for the black hilt in his hand, the scent of scent extends to the dark barriers around him. He and the king of the endless sea of ​​Necromancer seem to have little to match the king of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the same when it’s just appeared in the Glorious Castle. It’s not just the change of appearance. It’s completely different. It’s not the thorny black that has swallowed everything. The rest of the shocking fear is just the same void as the surrounding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this is the essence of ‘death’. The so-called horror so-called cruel so-called black is actually just from the heart of the soul itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not the breath of the black hilt in his hand, Asa really wants to think that it’s just a illusory illusion. He even can't afford to fight. It's just a portrait of a hunter who has enough courage to make a good thought and write a suicide note to prepare to kill a lion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not just a feeling of weightlessness. Standing in front of him really gives him a sense of nothingness. It seems that there is a physical black hole that physically exists, and all the impulses of all his emotions are completely lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you will come so I have been waiting for you." The King of the Dead said empty. "I can feel that all of this is the traction of fate. So I am here waiting for the fate to bring you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word "destiny?" I have heard it many times, but it makes me feel bored more than once. It’s now.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is not saying that he is talking to him. Speak to himself. He is not interested in chatting with this opponent, whether he is the king of the dead or who. Before he rushed in, he knew that the people who were left outside would face the land of the Necromancer. Perhaps hundreds of soldiers were dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The utterance can only go through the process and what he needs to come here is never going. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whatever fate you say, I only know that I am coming because I am coming to me to have a result." Take a deep breath. The endless empty air filled the chest is like a feeling of refilling yourself with fighting spirit and strength. This deep sucking into the ground is not only the air but also the roots of all the powers of the mind and soul. He lifted his knife and pointed to the person who had become the king of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not that you die or that I die. No matter which result doesn’t matter. Come and let me see the fate you said.” Asa’s voice is already hoarse. . He doesn't just use the inhaled air in the soul of the soul. All the emotions of the soul have all poured out in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if I rushed into this space or because I felt his will. The Ghost of the Ghost has already been attached to him. It seems that every fiber has been integrated into the body's capillaries and is combined with the body. From the outside, it is no longer a seemingly ordinary robes with horns and bulges that begin to appear on it like a beast finally showing off its claws and horns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I want you to die, everything is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roar screamed out of his mouth in this emptiness space like a torn person who echoed Asa’s and the knives in this hand The integration of a phantom makes a phantom with all the power that is spurred out and rushes toward the king of the dead. He uses this real power to tear this smashing enemy into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the central emptiness, the darkness of the atmosphere slowly fades. Half of it is because Gruner’s arrow is half because of the huge shadow from the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge strange notes coming from the shadows and then reverberating in the space are not any known language but more majestic than any language. The wide desert actually sounds like a small fighting room. The echoes are not scattered, but they are constantly echoing and reverberating. In the space that was originally filled with darkness, there were countless subtle blue sparks, and the rest of the coalition forces began to lie down on the ground and swayed. Only a few people could stand in this weird sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tides of the undead that are slowly coming from here are completely still, and the undead are gradually collapsing in this grand voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of this undead sea, any elemental magic is powerless in the face of the death of the Dark Star. The ubiquitous lacquer is not only drowning all the elements of life, but also being submerged. Even the sergeants in the coalition have a low ability to cast spells here, even to the common master. But this is obviously the power of the magic spell, but it is still unscrupulous. The breath of darkness is gradually dissipating in this mantra and retracting back into the darkest of the central group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Molly? Teacher Sandro, you really did this..." The flames in Verdina’s eyes are like the fire in the hurricane. Will go out. As soon as she saw the figure, she understood what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the dragon language magic of the ancient dragon can break the enchanting atmosphere of the black star and the magic dragon can only be the only one on the whole big 6 A black dragon Princess Moriel, sealed by Archibald in the base of Nigan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancers behind the Lich have nothing to do but the indifference of a face is more indifferent than the lich who is already an undead. The blade of the Necromancer has been so close to the Dark Star of the Deva Valley. The brand of the dark star in their body has already played a role. All the original reason has been concealed. It is only between the living creature and the undead between the corpse and the lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the inevitable fate of the Necromancer, which Ajibad set for them. And Sander chose another one at this last juncture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame that the lich suddenly turned into his eyes suddenly thrived. The dark dragon that she sat down, an overwhelming green corpse fire, sprayed toward Gru and everyone down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fire stopped only halfway through and stopped all the sounds that echoed in space suddenly stopped. All the blue sparks in the space are gathered around the green corpse fire and the dark dragon. Then the smoldering fire is in the air, like the moment of solidification, the green fire begins to collapse together with the body of the entire cyan dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A screaming sorcerer led the rest of the Necromancers to jump off the ground. When they landed, the Dark Dragon had turned into a sky full of debris disappearing into the void, even if the atmosphere of the surrounding dark stars could not preserve its image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the soul of Randa's banned in the Dark Star? Your spell has made me a little sad and sorcerer..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Dragon has already flew to a huge figure in the blink of an eye. At the same time as landing, she has become the image of a woman in black with a fiery red head. She looked at the lich and the other necromancers behind her and then nodded casually and said, "You are strong by humans. From the magical power, it is only a little weaker than Akibad." But I really don't like the undead so you all die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mollier's voice still maintains the majesty of the dragon, although the dragon language The effects of magic have dissipated but not many people in the coalition can stand up. Especially the orc, even the strongest ogre, is now similar to a frightened rabbit. Even in the face of endless undead, they are not afraid but now they are shaking. This instinct of the animal's nature is far from the instinct of its powerful existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
