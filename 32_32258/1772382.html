			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, how come I have forgotten me?" Asa sighed with relief. His hands grabbed Adela's hand and neck and looked at the stunned people around him. "You can't shake me. Just use it. The neck of the cardinal will soon be like a broken powder. Then the magic of the dead spirit can turn his brain into a muddy mud and then a brilliant white magic. It can't be cured either."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several great priests, the Cardinal Talis, who have already set their positions and together with Lancelot, they have surrounded Asa but No one dares to have the slightest incitement even if they still don't know that it is the real pope who used the soul magic to occupy Adela's body. After all, it is also the cardinal who is the acting pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think it's you." Adela shook his head and his voice was heavy and sour as if it had emerged from the soaked vinegar. The orcs came too suddenly and all the spirits of the people from the beginning of the battle were no longer worthy of their attention, even if they thought that the situation on his side could not be considered in such a situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I did not expect that I could really run out. I thought I had become a coke..." Asa nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dozens of huge fireballs in the dark red fire cloud rolling down the big angels, surrounded by white light, a sword and a sword, will break the fire meteor At the time, Asa was struggling in the steel prison. Although he couldn't see the spectacular scene in the sky, he felt very clear. A hill-like fireball is crossing the archangel's blockade and rolling down with a thunderous roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a pity that he has tried countless times and the results of this time are no different. The chain that locked him and the steel prison were still strong. At first he only listened to the huge winds and louder and louder until he was deafening, and even the steel walls could not stop the burning with the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tens of thousands of pounds of fireballs slammed into the fire, the mud and the stones in the sky. The paper that people knead is deformed and flies. It was just rubbed by the edge of the fireball, which was originally an unbreakable cage. It was smashed in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa also feels that she is almost ruined and has been banned from magic. He can’t use it. He now has no difference with an ordinary person. The powerful force of the powerful force is no different from the paper paste. The huge shocks lived and smashed his body and the locked chain together and even broke out. The high temperature of the fire magic around the fireball has already baked him half-cooked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then the ** that is no different from the death of the sky immediately began to heal quickly with a quick degree. The white magic of the imprisoned prison and the chains that are no longer in the body immediately attracts the healing power of Purdue beings into the body. The Pope, who spent the last psychic use of the curse, was the first to save him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, it is not unexpected that you will get out of trouble but you didn't expect that after you got out of trouble, you can't escape and take such a big risk here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Escape is not my habit. Is it better to have a chance to solve the problem completely than to escape? And if there is a chance to escape, how can there be such a good opportunity? "Asa pinched Adela's hand and grabbed the leaf of the world tree in Adela's hand and it had already fallen into his hand." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adela and Lancelot's face are discolored at the same time. But Asa’s hand immediately tightened and said, “Don’t move. If you really don’t want to talk to me, it doesn’t matter. I can safely escape if I kill this guy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Adela suddenly smiled and said: "I am sorry that I really have no value as a hostage. I am only temporarily acting for the position of the Pope. Compared to the leaves of the world tree, my life is nothing." You don't have to worry about Slot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't have to show me the Pope, do you want me to say it out loud?" Lanslow Specially did not respond to Asa, first whispered. His voice was so low that only Lancelot and the Pope could just hear it. "I feel that your guy's temperament and tone are completely different from before. Plus Lancelot's attitude towards you. But I confirmed it before I started. Although I don't know exactly what you are using, but I probably guessed that this method is not appropriate. So please don't worry about fooling me anymore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it." Lance Lott sighed and said suddenly. "My brother and I can promise you to forgive your crimes from now on. Oufu has lost that you are not very useful to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
