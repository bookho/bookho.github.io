			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top magic and top magic scrolls are simply two concepts, a complex mantra, and a high-level magic seal that requires a short preparation time to become a The primary magic apprentice can instantly send magical props. In some ways, this method of casting simply violates the magical art of magic. So the cost of this kind of foul is usually amazing. The trouble of the production process is not to mention. Even if you make a reel like a fiery bomb, it will cost thousands of gold that can be used as a magical increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the level of space lock and gravity field, not to mention the magic, even if it is not a curse, its preciousness is almost the same. But now it’s easy to say it from the mouth of Sedros, and it’s less expensive than ordinary magic items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sedros is sitting in a chair, in front of the huge body of the Tauren priest, his white man, who is white, looks very thin and small, his expression and tone. It is not dignified, but now the priest of Tema sees his eyes as if he is looking up at the behemoth of the black dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandefes Mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The towering peaks towering between the heavens and the earth, the clouds that surround the mountainside all year round completely cover the peaks above, making these peaks look like support The pillars of the heavens and the earth stretch and are huge. The strong winds between the mountains and the thunderstorms and blizzards that occur from time to time, even the huge Bimeng and Thunderbirds and Eagles, are just small ants who struggle to survive in this majestic and cold mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the foot of the mountain. Gru leans on a piece of open space and sits under a rock, closing his eyes and seemingly resting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this mountain range, human beings are extremely small. The wind in the mountains can tear people's fragile bodies into pieces, and even the lowest animals here are far stronger and stronger than humans. But he was just tired to sit there. It seems to be as big, cold, majestic, and arrogant as the majestic mountain behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were several tall gray beasts who took a head between the distant rocks and immediately shrank back. Although these animals are the main predators of Bimun, they are actually stronger and more ferocious than ordinary ogres. However, this simple-minded animal can't appreciate the momentum of Gru. What makes them retreat is other, more direct reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru's side, at the foot, around, are more than a dozen corpses of broken and broken. Each corpse is dozens of times larger than his body. It is the behemoth at the top of the food chain between the mountains: Bimon, Thunderbird, and Eagle. These fierce animals are kings in the Sandefes Mountains. This open space is not natural, and the huge plants and rocks that are broken around indicate that it was hardened and flattened in a fierce battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grou is all red and brown all over the body, that is the color of the dried blood. These blood can no longer tell whether it is his own or this body. The whole person and the open space, blood, and the smell of the body are all integrated, so that all other animals are afraid to approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, the clouds appear as gold and iron symphonies that were cut by swords, and passed through the fierce hurricane. Glou, who heard the sound, stood up. Blinking, a pair of dark and calm scorpions looked at the three blue spots that passed through the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three blue light spots are approaching and getting bigger quickly, these are three thunderbirds that are all around the blue electric light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be the last batch of "challengers". Once they repel the three Thunderbirds, the animals here will instinct to recognize this area. Belongs to his territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just the outer edge of the mountain, and there are no more powerful behemoths and older Thunderbirds. However, it is still difficult to imagine the establishment of such a region in animals that are extremely sensitive to foreign organisms. But once it is established, this will be the first step in establishing a base in here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, even the strongest have never thought of the idea of ​​building a stronghold in the Sandefes, although the coveted people here It has never been lacking, but they are all trying to collect enough ore and then leave. The conditions here are too bad, and away from any civilization, supply and maintenance are unimaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if it’s a powerful and well-equipped orc, if you have the logistics support of Oufu, which is not too far from here, it’s true to establish such a stronghold. It is possible. The two previously captured younger babies have grown a lot, and the domestication has been very successful. With the help of the orcs, it is possible to ensure the safety and open the territory. Then, the planned survey, the efficiency of mining and transportation, is far from being comparable to the small number of stealers who risked their lives once and for all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
