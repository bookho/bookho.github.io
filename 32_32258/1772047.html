			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa lie in the grass haystack and listen carefully to the sound of his belly, smelling the musty smell of the grass underneath. The big men on the wine table next to them are eating a big chunk of meat and pouring wine to each other to brag about the brave laughter of the brave war on the battlefield and the woman's bed. The big men have their own weapons at their feet, and there are also blood stains on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few thinner men on the grass next to Asa who are lying like death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the mercenary pub in Airy City, where all the people in the city who are planning to change their money are going to be someone else or a bodyguard. The robbers are accomplices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fleshy smell that floated over there and the musty smell underneath formed a great contrast. Asa suddenly imagined that the big men suddenly had a dispute with themselves. They can scream at them all on the ground and then sweep away all the rest of the table. It is a pity that the big men were totally immersed in the small world of beer and beef and chatter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is really not hungry for the purpose of finding a swearing person for a few pieces of meat. What's more, just now, there was a big man who was happy and invited a pub to have a drink. Even though it might only be an occasional euphoria, it still let Asa's mourning go out of nowhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money borrowed from Cris is actually enough for a good horse and some adventures must be left until the day I met in the wild ten days ago. When he was hanging up the vendor, he still had eight silver coins and more than thirty copper coins. The unlucky trader met a group of big-eared monsters in the wild. The big-eared monsters didn’t kill him. They only robbed him of the goods he bought with all his savings. Asa gave the horse and money to him and walked to the city of Airy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa suddenly missed the time in the wilderness jungle. At least the food is not enough to catch a large prey for enough days. And in this human-populated city, anything has a price. If you want it, you have to buy it with money. If you want money, you have to use your labor time to change the technology you have to change. Otherwise, you only have to steal and lie to grab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is not really suitable for living in this homogeneous environment. He does not have normal people to follow the established order of customs and lifestyles, such as the habit of being instructed to go to work habits in exchange for meaningless actions that are meaningful to them, such as food. He also did not ignore the blunt tyrants of the orderers. Once he thought about the feelings of the other party, he would not dare to rob. And stealing and deceiving is even more powerful. It is not only hard to be blunt, but also has to be willing to think that you are lower than others and do not dare to face it hard before you have to take other means to speculate. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But people are animals in the end. How to enjoy the habit of living alone is actually deep in the heart or hope to communicate with similar people. Even if he is so hungry, Asa will stay in this hard-to-find city and watch the living and eating of others. Listening to the street, the horses and the cocks will make him feel the peace that he can never have in the wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just is not accustomed to the lifestyle given by this strange environment. It seems that a native wild dog lives in a dog environment and feels uncomfortable but likes it. Countless likes. He can stay in the city and he still doesn't want to go out. So he came here to try his luck, even if he didn't have any other useful life skills, but his physical strength is still competent. And here maybe you can still hear the news of the damn forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been wandering around the city for a long time. He has been asking about the 'whispering forest' or the 'difficult forest" message has asked a lot of people completely No gains are said to have been arrested as pagans. In the city of Airy, it seems that the pagans are so fierce that there are soldiers everywhere. During the search, people are seen crying and shouting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub's door was pushed open. A young man is standing at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of everyone in the pub have cast their eyes. This is not the same youth wearing a set of knight costumes, although it is very old but still very neatly worn on the body is still wearing a cloak that is obviously only decorative. The handsome face was neatly tidy like a bundle on his body. This should be a visit to a few people next to Asa to find their heads to restore some anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man is nervously looking around at the pub who is either fierce or sinister. The opening is said to be as flat and high as possible: "I am the Knight of Rodhart here to recruit a brave man to be my attendant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing at the door, the young man said like a recitation: "What I am asking is a firm belief in kindness and unlimited loyalty to the master and the knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; A stronger sneer and a sneak peek on the grass, there is a person asking, "How much is a day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have money. I can give The person who follows me is more valuable than money. It is a noble spirit and a great honor. His name will always be engraved by my name and will always be rumored by the poets." The young people continue to recite their own declaration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a maddening laughter in the pub. The big men rushed to the table and heard the rap of the most famous comedians of the Grand Six. A few people on the pile of grass have laughed and lived up. A big man laughed and asked the bartender: "Where did you get such a joke? Grandpa gave him a reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender smiled and shook his head Going over to the young man who is already flushed, "There are some grandfathers who are taking money to sell their lives. You went to the country in the wrong place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young man tried his best to continue his persuasion: "I will go to the woods in the south of the city to perform a very dangerous but great task. Can brave people come with me?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a drunken smoked man standing up and squinting and approaching the young man pointing at the young man’s face and said: "This nonsense little guy is full of pretty if it’s a girl, I still have Interested in going out to play with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young knight who was a little angry and angered clenched his fists and glared at the big man. Although he wanted to keep a steady sound, everyone listened. Draw a trembling because of excessive anger: "In the name of God, if this person dares to insult a knight, he will His blood came to wash his sins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dahan squinted his eyes and pushed the young knight’s chest: "How? Want to fight?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stomach is going to be beaten. Asa looked at the young knight's shoulder and fell down to know that he was going to shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A muffled young knight’s right fist hits the abdomen of Dahan. Dahan's body immediately turned to the forehead and immediately fell on the forehead. The meat that I had just eaten was wow, and I came out from the mouth. The other four great men at the table of Dahan immediately raised their weapons and rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step forward to the left half and elbow him under his ribs and smash him. Asa watched the knight's body sink and move forward, and silently speculated his next move in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Han Knight, who is armed with several weapons, does not retreat to the front. When the opponent slashed under the knife, he turned and leaned to the left to escape the knife. At the same time, an elbow hit the big man's soft ribs and the next muffled big man suffocated and fell to the right just to block the weapons of the two big men on the right. The two big men rushed to pick up the knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turned to the hook and hit it. Asa predicted in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big man on the left just lifted the hammer over his head and was punched in the squat. The sound of the broken bones made everyone in the pub feel very clear. . Asa can still see that he probably lost five or six teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get up and kick the knee recently and hold the last right hand and twist the neck and finish the neck. This young knight is quite good at his skill. Asa feels that her observation and mind seem to be more and more clear. It used to be that it is absolutely impossible to see other people's movements predicting the movements. Although the book was mortgaged by him, the meditation method described above is long enough to remember that he is still practicing every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers have called the last big man’s arm backwards and the big man hurts to kill the pig. The Cavaliers looked at the big men on the floor and some annoyed and annoyedly loosened their hands. Although they just said that they wanted to see the blood, they still couldn’t get the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to the big man who had just been released at the door and picked up a sword from the ground and stabbed him toward the knight vest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through half of a hand from the back, holding the hand of the big man, holding the sword in the hand of the big man, landing and then twisting backwards with the same technique as the previous knight. I started to continue the call just now. But only a half-sounding shot on the back of the neck immediately silenced him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
