			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the spectators on the sidelines were screaming in unison and watching Asa being shot from midair by the arrow. Only Luya reacted and turned and shouted at the female patrol: "You made a mistake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wrong? What's wrong?" Karin stunned. I didn't respond to my eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fuck. Where are you shooting? You stupid woman." Hilton jumped up. If there weren't too many elves around, he would immediately rush to kill the female elf there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa on the ground moved but only lifted the body a little and it wouldn’t work. The power of this arrow is the same as that of Heilika's vindicated two-handed sword. If it weren't for his instinct to use a knife to block a block, the head that could be shot could be shot like an egg under a heavy blow. The impact that was uploaded across the blade hit him on the head. He now only feels dizzy and can only listen to the laughter of Hilika and the sound of the big swords of his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill old man hurriedly waved his staff and slammed Hiprica with a finger but Hilika still didn’t even react, but his body fell. On the ground. It is obvious that the spirit and will of the two people are far apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hilton and Jessica saw the rushing inside but the sticky air made them unable to catch up anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The vine of the vine." At this time Luya waved the leaves of the world tree against Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black magic area around Asa suddenly spreads out on a green open space. The ground quickly spurts many rattans and thorns around him. Just wrapped him into a big rattan ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika is a little bit. However, the two-handed sword is still smashing in the vines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rattan splashes the two-handed sword and only cuts into a few inches and cuts dozens of canes and can't enter it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the same volume of granite is absolutely shattered under this sword. But those rattans are not hard but rather tough and have a very good elasticity, which completely digests the power of the toppings. This pair of great swords and no sharp edges rely on huge weight. Almost a blunt weapon has no way of doing this kind of resilience and flexibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silika screamed at the big swords and raised all the vindictiveness on the top of the sag. He wants to cut the takraw ball together with the people below to cut a mixture of meat and rattan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the rattan in the underground was still growing in madness as he was horrified. It seems that it is a snake that is very moving. In the twinkling of an eye, not only the depression just cut out healed. Even the size of the rattan ball has increased a lot. The sword of Helicia is still a large piece of sunken on the rattan ball but it has been restored in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be fine with him." Luya shouted at the Hilton who had already rushed over. This protective magic of the elf is definitely the best protection magic when it is not moving. Although it is a bit rigid, the effect is amazing. As long as it is not directly hit by any great magic, it is absolutely innocent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them immediately returned. Hilton was shocked and delighted and said loudly to Luya: "It’s still the elf sister. You are so beautiful." It was just Luya who ignored him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give me this stuff." Helicika turned his head and yelled at the madness of Axis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I’ve been struggling with this now." Aisisi said with a roll of magic scrolls lying on the ground and said weakly. A few thieves next to him are helping him bandage the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luya used the leaves of the world tree to point to the huge rattan ball and walked toward the front. As soon as she approached the black magical area, the black magical fluctuations were pushed away like tides. She looked at Helicika. All faces are angry and disgusting and say, "Don't struggle to surrender and attack the evil invaders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika looks at the black eyes The area slowly dispersed to the Aisisi under the approach of the girl: "What is going on with my mother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the black magic fluctuations of Luya or the leaves of the world tree are more than ten meters away. The grass that had died in the black area was gradually regaining its vitality. More than a dozen unicorns automatically focused on the thieves around Lucia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dozens of elf wizards around the gathering, and now they are also chanting the spells of the elves. Several dead wood guards also approached Luya's side and drilled a lot of colorful insects on the ground. The body is constantly rising. Around a distance of more than ten meters around Luya, a variety of guards were filled. Looking at the elf girl and the group of guards approaching the thieves have a terrible color on their faces. Needless to say, the battle is just close to the past or death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop." Silika glared at Luya and slammed the giant sword in his hand onto the head of an Elf Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luya’s footsteps hesitated a little. Helica’s hand and the elf mage under the giant sword screamed and became a bologna. The elves around were all screaming again. Then Hilika put the sword on the head of another elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want? I tell you that our elves are not threatened by evil people like you." Luya blinked and looked at her teeth. Greek. It’s a pity that her appearance would like to make a fierce expression and could not catch up with a smile from Xilika. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I never threaten people. I only tell others the consequences of not listening to me." Silika looked at Lucia. "We can talk about a deal. You can save most of the elves here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luya smiled and said, "Do you think you can still run away?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course. Don't doubt me if you don't have that qualification yet." Silika smiled and smiled at the scarlet tongue in the mouth. . Seems to want to volley her. His hand slowly pressed down the sword and the elf's wailing sounds louder and louder and then stopped in the sound of Kara's broken head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will ask you if you want to talk about the transaction now?" Helicika smiled a little and his smile was calm. The huge swords covered with flesh and blood were placed on the head of the next elf. There are more than one hundred elf captives here enough for him to perform slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luya’s expression suddenly twisted and shook and said, “What trade do you want to talk about?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika is satisfied with the nod. The trick of negotiating is to let others see how crazy he is. More will say it will be done. As long as the opponent is destroyed in the mind, the only thing left is to take the other side away. Even so many thieves who carry their heads to live are being held by him, not to mention these idiot-like elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we can't escape, we can guarantee that the elves caught here will be killed before we are killed. But we can also put most of them here. The elves are all released and only take away ten. But you have to use something to change with me." Hilika's hand pointed to Lucia and pointed the ball into the rattan. "Take the thing in your hand. And that person to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Absolutely not this is the sacred object of our elf..." Luya has not Finished. It was interrupted by the scream of the elf under the Helician sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika’s experience in these areas is absolutely a master. He is as subtle as the artist's own work, and his position is so subtle that the captives of his men will be the most shocking screams in the most common time. Watching all the elf's expressions twisted in the screams of this compatriot, Ilika believed that the effect he had wanted had been achieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beautifully fairie chick. I will say that this price is already the bottom line I can accept. I tell you that it is no problem for us to come here. "Hilika's eyes wandered like a long-lasting tentacle on the face of Luca's face. I smiled. "I originally wanted to take you to the ground. I will give you to the kings of those countries. I believe I can also get a general position." He looked at Aisi. "Okay, my friend's spirit is not good, so we have limited time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From now until this chick promises us to kill one every ten minutes. We Let's go." Helicia no longer understood that Ruya turned and shouted at the thieves. Enough for the elves to hear clearly. "Remember that these guys will kill the elves in your hands as soon as they move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helicika didn't have to go back. He is sure that the elves and his differences are like Bimen and rabbits. He knows he has won. Even this elf chick didn't agree that he couldn't get the strange leaves, and he got the nearly one hundred elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the designated task of the old man was to get the strange leaf, Helicia now suddenly feels that it is not impossible. The Necromancer is indeed very tempting about the conditions they promised, but he has had a strange feeling since the situation here is not as good as he intended. What the feeling is, he said that he is not very clear but always feels that there is no big difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it’s not bad to get these elves. For the first time in his life, Hilika had such a greedy idea that he almost had to say that he didn't want that thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Lucia's distraction wrapped in Asa's Sepak Takraw began to wither in the black area. The withered vine ball moved and broke from it. Asa took the knife and drilled it from the inside. The thieves carried Aisisi away from the black area and the encirclement of the elves also moved away. His current position is in the encirclement of the elves. Hilton, several of them also rushed around and surrounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Boss, are you okay?" Hilton looked at him and asked with surprise and joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa barely smiled or faintly headed: "Nothing. Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he can't see it in the Sepak takraw, he can still hear about the things around him. He was a little surprised by the anxious reaction of several of them. Although there is no one in this forest that is all elves. Then the departure of several of them is somewhat problematic, but they are still a little surprised by their anxiety. Especially the rectum of Hilton is not about the expression of the fake face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luya and most of the elves are still staring at the thieves who are leaving. Only a dozen elves around watched Asa, who had a little dizzy, and they had a lot of fear and disgust in their eyes and subconsciously hid. There is no doubt that the bloody suffocation has just made them react. The elves feel much more savvy than the human being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female patrol with the black giant bow, Karin, is particularly disgusted with his disgust. Asa also stunned her and gave her a rehabilitative treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the magical light shining on the face of the female patrol, the disgusting color immediately became amazed. This is purely pure white magic and even a faint scent that makes her feel close. This made her completely unable to understand. A person who uses such bloody and evil weapons actually uses white magic, which actually has a lifelike resemblance to the holy things. This is as unbelievable as a rotten zombie but spit out the Word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surprise color of several people next to Hilton is no worse than the elves. They realized that this confused person who became their leader may be really unfathomable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to ignore the elves’ surprises and no time to explain to these newcomers that Asa is worried about the situation in the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves are never able to hand over the leaves of the world tree. In fact, Asa and Cedros have never thought that relying on these thieves to get it from the elves is nothing but a blind man. It’s a trap. However, the stalemate in the situation is by no means a good phenomenon, not to mention the fate of the one hundred elves. The key is those who should appear but have not yet appeared. Those guys are at the heart of this plan and the most dangerous place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the plan is to let the Necromancers who are going to appear to be aware of the existence of the world tree. But this is so generously placed outside. If those guys use what method to take it away, then it is really not stealing the chickens, not just eclipsing the rice and the cylinders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa touched the small piece of the star in his arms. This is what he used to inform Cedros in an emergency. This special product does not require magical power, as long as it crushes the same piece of Sedros there will be a reaction. Then he and Gru will come in the first time. According to the fact that the two of them are now in a state of hand. Helicia is certainly not a good deal, but that is only relative. There seems to be no hard to deal with people and things in front of Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the bodies of the elves and the elves who were hijacked, Asa’s fingers were tight but they still didn’t pinch. If the stunned snakes let the necromancers who seem to be ignorant, they feel the existence of these two people and do not appear. The whole plan will be gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
