			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Moto, who originally wanted to hear the soft talk, asked him to follow Asa’s gaze. An old man was standing in the distance and copying his hand. The look of indifferent things is not his own, and I look at it like a lively look at the market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modo was a little surprised that he didn’t know how the old man came here. But the swordsmen and the magician of the Paladin have always been as sculptural as they have been from the beginning of the battle, but now they are all horrified. Even if they are tempered in the life and death line, there is no such thing as how the old man appeared here. Even if I noticed this old man, I couldn’t feel the slightest movement and the breath of living things as if it were just a illusory illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the illusion is never to speak. The old man didn’t seem to see other people smirking at the ground with a chattering sneer and said: "I thought you would be right at the wind, but I don’t think it’s like a pig on the chopping board. Urine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard saves me, I am dying." Asa spoke has no strength and has already swayed the dog's blood. The blood on his shoulders and thighs has been dying in the wounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru’s eyes replied with a sigh of relief: “You are a bastard, how can I save you? Everyone here can see that I am just How can the old man who has no hands on the chickens deal with these big men who still have knives in their hands?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime minister still squats there at all Know what is going on. And the magician immediately changed his hand and waved to the swordsman: "Kill it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsmen of the two swordsmen have already been stunned. Sa's carotid artery was shown to immediately press the wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the two swords just slipped over Asa’s neck and broke the two bloods and fell to the ground. The strength of the swordsmen is nowhere to go when they reach the elbow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two arms fell silently on the ground and still clasped two swords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two swordsmen shouted. But there are more than half of the ingredients in the voice that are not pain but panic and shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have always focused on the strange old man in front. But this old man did not move his hands and took a leisurely copy. The shot is another person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person has been lying straight and not far away, but now he suddenly flies up and flies with a swift, snake-like posture like a snake. Weird, similar to what the arthropods swayed, the long sword in his hand cut the hands of the two swordsmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who rushed over did not lose sight of the swordsman’s side and fell to the other side in a quirky posture. His legs were like a locust, and he bent over his body and stepped on the ground, his buttocks and his waist almost stuck together. As soon as he landed, he turned and twisted his legs and slammed back straight and lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His posture in the air is very weird and completely unbalanced and coordinated as if it were just thrown out by his twisted legs. But in this quirky but incomprehensible position, his right hand holding the sword suddenly stretched and softened like a whip. He wandered from his back and could stick out a long sword from the left armpit. The other two swordsmen who kept Asa's sword were cut down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four swordsmen who are either broken or turned around are first-class masters, but there is almost no reaction time in this ‘human’ attack. This person's shot is too fast and too strange to pick up and fall and can't see any clues. It looks like a monster made with several different types of bugs mixed with snakes and lizards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more critical is the extreme horror that makes the swordsmen not aware of the reaction because the person who shot this is actually their companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person has just held a long sword and bravely left a deep scar on Asa’s body and was also thrown by Asa’s broken sword. Inserted into the brain. Now I have stood up again and saved Asa with a more vigorous and energetic and imposing move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a fragmented face full of metal fragments. One eye has only one bloody tear hanging under the big blood hole. It seems to be his own death. And a little sad and the other looked at the people who were scared and scared. He is now like a reptile with one hand and two feet on one hand and the other with a stretched hand like a whip on the ground to see that the bones inside have been pulled by their own actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsmen finally awake from the horror for many years of training and immediately recovered a clear sense of battle and steel-like fighting spirit. Two broken arm swordsmen rushed over to use this surviving hand and The feet clenched his limbs tightly together. Even if they have lost their fighting power, they have to fight for their offense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the leading magician completely ignored this heroic self-sacrifice and instead drank to the remaining swordsmen: "Flee away and flee back to report The captain slammed the head of the team. "The swordsmen who were about to rush over just slammed a little and immediately fled and fled. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician is usually the most clear-headed, calmest and most accurate person. His words are orders when there is no captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a short sentence of time, the two swordsmen who flew up are dead. Almost as soon as they had just hugged the monster, the man who had died early suddenly opened his mouth. His mouth was so big that he tore his cheeks and his mouth cracked into his ears. He bit the half of a swordsman with a bite-like mouth like a snake. Then his head slammed into the head of another swordsman and drummed like a muffling sound and the two heads deformed together. The two swordsmen, whose heads are no longer shaped, fell softly down the corpse of the monster, but they still stood on the head like a rotten persimmon. They stood up and used the half of the eyeball that had already taken off their eyes to look away. The swordsmen rushed toward them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he only carried it halfway through it. The magician smashed the ice and hit his lower body. His waist and his feet immediately frozen into a large ice cube. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who has fallen to the ground and who has been completely deformed and still seems to be still struggling to chase the swordsman, but now he can’t move, he I pulled my hand that was still in good shape and moved, and threw it out with the long, strange hand like a spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A swordsman who escaped immediately fell into the back of the head and inserted the hand into the tomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpse squeezed his neck and threw off his rotten half of the head. The rotten head screamed with blood and other pieces of eccentric whistling and finally broke completely with the head of a swordsman. Then the body of the arm without the head and the lower body frozen into a whole piece of ice and only a snake-like deformed arm finally did not move. It seems that the evil spirits on the top finally consumed their power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician did not see the scene behind him and did not fall to the ground of Asa. He used all his spirit to face Sandru. He has already seen that the weird variations of these bodies are all the old ones. This is the real enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Sander didn’t care that he just muttered a few syllables that no one could understand, and pointed to the bodies on the ground. It means that the four new bodies immediately jumped up their hands and feet and used the ground to chase the swordsman who fled with the quirky but extremely fast like the corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, two swordsmen were caught up. The corpse was like a tarantula that slayed its prey. When it was stretched out, it was close to the swordsman. Then a swordsman made a voice half of the throat. The body of the body was like a roast chicken. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician leached a cold sweat on his head. In the face of full alert, this old man can still use the spell without any problems, and the weightless movements and magical use make him have no idea how to shoot. This understatement uses such strange and imaginative magic to control and repair magic, and may even be above the Bishop of Ronis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician reached out and took a deep breath to condense magic. He did not mourn the mantra but was as simple and direct as the warrior condensed his temperament to bring together all his magical power and every energy and even vitality in the body. Faced with a spellcasting art that is much higher than your own opponents, spending the spirit of magic control is almost an opportunity for opponents. He doesn't ask himself what kind of spells he can do to hurt this person. He only hopes that his decades of magic can make him resolve hard enough to prevent him from manipulating the bodies and letting several companions have Opportunity to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician's palm has a white light in the center of the palm of the magical power has been impatient to break through the madness of this **. This is the magic essence of a senior magician who has been working hard for decades. He is released without any reservation. The power is never less than a ** < < <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician’s breath on the palm of his hand skyrocketed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru finally took the shot but just casually took out a hand and used his pale hand to catch a twist in the air. Gestures seem to twist an invisible switch in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical power of the body is going to rush and torrent. The magician spurts out from the palm of his hand and suddenly feels that there are two muscles on his arm that are inexplicably pumped. It is the cramping of the muscles, but the strength of this cramping just bends his straight hand and presses the palm of his hand on his face. He originally wanted to fight with this sudden arm that was my own, but the last bit of power in the body had been transformed into magic power, so he only watched how his lifelong cultivation was tilted to his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A half-story of wood behind the strange screaming magician flew into the polar winter from the early summer in this blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the trees and flowers and insects in a fan-shaped area have become the last two or three swordsmen of the ice sculpture to chase the two bodies of the swordsman in an instant Some of the stiffness still keeps the shape of the original run, and there are some stone statues that fall straight on the frozen ground and make a hard state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru looked at the face of the magician who had been condensed in a large ice cube. The hand still pressed on his face. Unwilling and horrified. He shook his head and said: "There can be such a deep magical repair that you can think of such a tactic that you should be a Paladin. But at least you should use a magic to defend or give yourself some strength. Ah."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the blink of an eye, the elites of the more than a dozen of the Paladin's Warrior empire elites have each died in a weird way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you shoot early? I almost died." Asa gave himself a cure and finally sighed to point to the crawling Moto escaping from the ground. "Where there is a runaway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Modo’s reaction was almost faster than the swordsman who passed through the station when the magician shouted . It was only when he turned around that he just saw the corpse opening his mouth and smashing the swordsman who had just been alive and kicking his brain. His legs were immediately soft. Only the ones crawling on the ground like the smashing dogs and hands and feet were desperately moved forward. Leave a big smell. He ran in the opposite direction of the swordsmen, and the cold did not affect him, and Sandro seemed to ignore him completely. He moved farther and probably felt that the danger had not been great, and finally he straightened his waist and his legs began to run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru bent over and picked up the head of a swordsman on the floor and opened his mouth like two small pieces of dough from the bread. One finger and one finger pulled off a tooth and placed it in the middle of the thumb and fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teeth are not flying fast in the air and they have turned around like a feather, and they are also very inaccurate. More ass got into his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modo is still yelling to run away but his feet seem to have fallen into something. He instinctively used his hands to support but the hands couldn't support the weight of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his inertia, he continued to roll forward and just turned over, he had only half of his body left. He started the limbs below him from the abdomen. Like the blistered bread, the shock is all scattered and scattered everywhere. After another round of the upper body, there was no upper body left, only one head left to roll forward until it hit a tree root like a pottery made by the worst inferior. The small, poor voice became a stupid mud. Nothing even the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru looked at the big living man in the spit of the time and became a group of flesh and blood that was worse than the spit. He shook his head a little regret, saying : "There has been no regression for many years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sat on the ground and used healing to heal a wound on his body. Looking at Sandru seems to have not even moved his hand, he has been amazed at the fact that the dozens of swordsmen who are not worse than themselves have been killed. Although he also knows that the old man should be able to deal with these people, it is so easy to think of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru looked around and saw the niece sitting on the floor. The scene of this strange scene that was born just now has scared her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa was shocked and jumped forward to push the cockroach away. The teeth rubbed her shoulders and flew over a tree that was not in the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree did not sway, but immediately wilted with a degree of 10,000 times faster than the natural process and then collapsed silently into a pile Wood slag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa explained to Sandru: "In fact, she is not deliberately just being deceived, so she lied to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, so what then?" Shandru nodded. "You won't say that you want to let her go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stunned him of course. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra's black and white eyes sneered at Asa and asked: "Let him go out and tell others that you are a sacred man and actually become a corpse. The old man has collusion to kill a small team of Paladins? Then we wait for the entire Paladin group to besiege us. Your bishop is also a populous. Do you mean this?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning from Ghost Gate, I’ve been scared and I’m so scared that the tears and the original makeup on my face are mixed up and I’m confused and ugly. She groaned and said, "I promise not to go out and say, I swear that you let me go. I beg you to beg you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru is sorry Shaking his head and said to her in a very gentle tone: "I'm sorry we don't dare to take risks. The throne of the Paladin is so big that it must be overwhelmed. If you look up, you will know that you have been in contact with the idiot and will naturally catch you. Strictly tortured the peppers, the water, the diced plate, the finger peeling, the cockroaches, the horrible thing, is there any vow to withstand those powerful things, can you still say it? It’s better to be so sinful than you. Going to death quickly keeps a secret for us." He pulled off one of his ears and was still chanting. "It’s not a big deal to die. It’s just a matter of time. It’s just getting old and ugly in the future. It’s better to wait in the bed and wait for the smell. It’s so beautiful and cute, it’s good to die. You can rest assured. It will never hurt." He threw the two fingers and flew over the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azra has started to escape. The ground that the ear fell on the ground immediately fell into a small mud-like porridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru did not speak this time and only looked at him squinting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I beg you to let her go?" After a while, Asa said. "I will let her keep it secret and not say it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please, please?" Sandro heard a sudden smile. "Off my bird, this is actually your problem. Think about it yourself." He turned and walked outside the woods and didn't look at Asa. He only said, "You just know that your choice is always forever." I have to bear it myself. Anyway, I am not afraid that others will find me trouble and I am not afraid to trouble others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Sandro leaving Asa sighed Tone. To be honest, he knows that what Sand said is probably right. But if he wants to see her killed, she can't do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are still a few friends in this kingdom, she must be one of them, perhaps the most important one. When I was with her, it was definitely the time when he felt the most relaxed and happy. Perhaps for most people she is a contemptuous person but Asa does not know that these only know that she is her. A very cute person who is superficial but very pure and cheesy. He even likes her very much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now everything in this life is clearly out of the range she accepts and cope with, just as a little hen is suddenly pulled into the wolf It’s impossible to kill a fight even if it can survive, but it’s impossible for her to calmly face it and find a way to fight between these wolves. These are too far away from her original life and she can't accept it. It is absolutely impossible for Shandru to say that she really wants to keep a secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;璇 Still in his arms still crying into a group and not dare to lift it up. Asa gently patted her shoulder and said softly: "It's okay, nothing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait until her mood is flat, Asa puts the whole body up and down. They all came out and picked up the gold coins scattered on the ground and stuffed them into the hands of the cockroaches and said to her: "You have listened. Now you go back and pack up the good things and buy a horse immediately. How far is it to leave the king? Don't come back again in the future. You must remember that if you let people know about our affairs, you will be very dangerous. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
