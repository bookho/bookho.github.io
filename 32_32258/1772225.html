The anger is amazed, sad, sad... Several expressions collide with each other on his face and pull Asa even suspect that his expression will be torn apart because his face muscles are excessively twitching. He screamed and screamed: "The guy... actually... actually..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa certainly knows the relationship between Rhodes Hart and the Queen But still telling him the first thing about this. Because he knows that this news is difficult to accept, but he must also tell him that he can only accept the facts before accepting them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he believes that Rhodes must be able to withstand these blows. He knows that Rhodehart has experienced more painful and sad things than these, so even if he is excited, he will calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Rhode Hart silenced after the face change for a while. After a while, his face was completely pale and he finally recovered. He finally nodded and said, "I Understand. But what are you going to do now? Have you told the prime minister about this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa quickly shook his head: "This is not a mess for the time being." Zhang Yang or the whole king will fall into complete chaos. In fact, the most important thing now is the necromancer who is the cardinal. He is the culprits of all things. He will solve all the problems and solve them."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't go with the people of the Paladin. I am now only the head of the acting teacher.

Do not worry. I just need you to lead him to a suitable place. I naturally have a way to clean up him. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Clys... can it be cured? I remember that the old gentleman of the School of Magic had magical skills. Is there a way? Asked Rhodes. His eyes and expressions were all anxious like a prisoner waiting for the final verdict.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa hesitated one. "Yeah maybe... maybe..." He glanced at the expression on Rhodesart's face. He couldn't imagine how such a sincere expression would collapse under the cruel reality.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt seems to understand something that makes a smile. Asa has never seen such a miserable smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flute Four of the dead spirit mages who had not left in Yagu were negotiating the letters sent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think this is a rare opportunity. Nopolino said first.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Necromancer shook his head and said, "But this is obviously for power struggles and interests for these." Need the Necromancer to gather together. What is the difference between Descartes and Robbers? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Aiden did not speak but looked at the agent president a little.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marquis contemplation Looking at the letter in the hand, a few lines of words are written for help. Such letters are rare in the history of the Diya Valley. Those who can join the Deva Valley are those who can stand at the top of the world. Being able to stand up to such a high level of enthusiasm, regardless of the ability of the city, they are so incomparable. They have kept a deliberate distance from each other for many years. They will cooperate with each other. But there will be no help. This is almost a weak person. Human actions.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now this letter is not just for help, but also briefly describes the benefits and benefits of this action. How do you want to be blatantly mentioning the benefits and benefits in the elegant Deva Valley like politicians and businessmen? It’s really a bit of a sensation. The teacher who has the most dislike of these things has left.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it does appear Too tasteful, but this letter is indeed related to the plan of Deya Valley. It is not that every member of the guild and Mr. Shant can be completely unmotivated. In this subtle time, the guild will be represented. Long opinions are undoubtedly the most important.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will help him." The white and fat Nopolino raised his hand. The nature of the magician seems to make him aware that it is profitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Aiden said faintly: "I can go if he can master the Magic Academy. I want him to help me to send Audley the stinky woman back to the teeth." The tower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis faintly replied: "This is what happened to you and his master. But I think since you have helped him, he I will naturally remember your kindness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aiden did not answer and just nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forgetting that since both of you are shooting, I can't put it on the shelf." The remaining Necromancer also sighed and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But because of Hamm, do you really have to take a shot? Although we all understand that you don't want to be smug, this is not a trivial matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis shook his head and smiled: "No because there are more important things waiting for me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp One day later, King Einfast was three or four hundred miles south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the temporary residence of the Emperor of England, Geffhardt XVII, which was temporarily built by local officials. Although simple, but the Emperor’s own wife is not so careless, he did not want to come out for a cruise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the Emperor’s Majesty may not be a good emperor, it is definitely not good anyway. At least he knew that he was not the material of the emperor, so he had been consciously listening to the arrangements of people around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it’s very uncomfortable to throw the sick and the Queen to go out alone to check out Geffenhardt XVII. This is not the common meaning of the Queen’s new elder sister Prime Minister and Roland’s head. He will never leave the Queen. In particular, the Queen’s disease is still very serious. Although he also knows that it may be relative to the illness of the Queen. Whether the new cardinal can regain the magic school is more important to this country, but in his own eyes, there is really no more important thing than the Queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days when he left Wang Du, he sent people back every day to inquire about the Queen’s condition. As the cardinal came to the news, he actually cured the Queen's illness. This really made Geffenhardt happy that he even wanted to rush back to the king to directly give the magic school to the cardinal. Handed over. But this is also the impulse. He himself knows that the loyalty of the two men who are more than a hundred times more than the ones in the national affairs, Mullak Prime Minister and Roland, are absolutely unquestionable. It is not necessarily a loyalty to him but a loyalty to this country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How? Is the Queen's body getting better?" Geffenhardt asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendant who just came back from Wang Dumao replied below: "The body of the Queen’s Majesty has now recovered and recovered completely as usual except for eating very little. Outside the cardinal adult said that she has fully recovered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about the vampire?" When the emperor asked this question, his face was a bit green. . He has made up his mind that if this matter has a tendency to show up in the bad direction, he will return to the capital with the head of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was nothing more than an ordinary murder. It has been confirmed that it was just an ordinary murder. Bishop Jarvi led the priests of the School of Magic and later examined it carefully. The body confirmed that it was actually murdered by a weapon and then faked the vampire's blood-sucking. The Lord Rodhart of the Guards was being ordered to investigate the murderer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s so good... The people from Celeste are really different. It seems that the cardinal is really amazing...” The emperor sighed and sighed in the long hall. This is undoubtedly the most people he heard these days. Happy news. "It seems that I should go back and thank the cardinal." The emperor asked for the opinion of the leader of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of Roland’s striker shook his head: "The more you stop, the more you don't have to go back."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor sighed helplessly and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the head of Roland also wanted to sigh and he did not expect this cardinal to come so. It just happened to cure the strange disease of the Queen's Majesty and seemed to solve a false alarm. The higher the prestige of this new bishop is, the more troublesome they are for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, maybe you can use some extreme means... Anyway, Celeste is busy dealing with Oufu. The head of Roland was impatiently unknowingly smothered with a hint of killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was immediately amazed because it was obviously not a reasonable solution. Then he immediately felt strange because he knew that he was not an easily excited and savage person. The idea didn't seem to make any sense. This strange is immediately followed by extreme vigilance. His hand has touched the hilt of the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to let a master unconsciously have a killing can only be the killing of another person. And this is not the kind of fierce murderousness that is exposed to the fangs, but another kind of dull, gentler and more subtle but more moist and immersed in the bone marrow. It is not a warrior or an assassin who can have such a killing can only be a magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Warning." Rolande chilled around the members of the Paladins and took out their weapons. Since the vampire incident that was born before, the guards around the emperor are no longer just ordinary guards but a small team of Paladins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" The Emperor of the Central Plains still did not know why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside of the palace is very quiet. This palace was originally built on a quiet and elegant lakeside. But other guards and vocals outside have disappeared unconsciously. It’s not just vocals, but even the bird’s beetle that should have been there has disappeared. Only the silence of this monk and the murderousness that seems to be mixed with the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very fierce sword light suddenly slanted out from the main hall of the palace and then this is a small house, slowly slipping from the waist to two . The interior and exterior of the house are all in one place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central lake does not know what is standing alone. This person is standing on the water, the wind birds around him have not seen the foot of the lake on the ground is a calm mirror. Such as a dead mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the guards and others who were standing outside have been lying quietly on the ground as if they were asleep. But it is obvious that this is not really asleep because no one will sleep so that all the skin around the body will have a corpse of white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people standing in the middle of the lake are all in the middle of a large mage robe with only the lower half of the face and the upper half of the face is a bright silver 骷髅mask. This mask doesn't seem to be very embarrassing and even the little ones can't be scared. But seeing this mask, the heads of Roland and other members of the team are shrinking because they are not children and they know what this mask represents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage in the lake, like the same statue, did not move, but the pair of eyes under the silver skull mask looked at the group of heads of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no fascinating lights in these eyes. Still very turbid. And at such a long distance, many people can't even see the eyes, but everyone has a feeling that the magician is watching himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person can see a group of people but can only look at one person while watching. This is what everyone knows. The emperor and the surrounding guards feel this distance. The magician is watching them. Even if the gaze and eyes can't see any traces, it can make people feel that it is an intuitive touch. Everyone felt a weakness and weakness spread from the body. This feeling is very strange. It seems to be diffused from the unconsciousness of one's own body, but it continues to swallow the vitality of every inch of the body with an imperceptible feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the name of the Lord, purify all the world's production." A priest sang the light of the magical light of the white magic. This strange feeling of opening immediately disappeared in the body of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white magician who can become a member of the Paladin can definitely rank in the 20th place of the Magic Academy. But the priest's face is still ugly. He turned his head and said to Roland: "The head of the group is the double erosion of soul magic and dark magic. My defense can only barely resist this. It is by no means a solution."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland took a long breath and took out the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword is only three feet long, but he is now at least three hundred feet away from the magician in the lake. But even then he still has a sword. Being able to return the sword at such a long distance is definitely the only one of the Big 6. Even the Lancero, who is known as the first person of the Big Six, may not be stronger than him if he is purely on the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
