			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s office is just waiting for the Duke’s reception<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The prime minister is absolutely impossible."The Duke of Mulak looked like a distressed look and refused.""Ai Li's Wood Karundo's Minerals Trade in Western Countries has long been a way for your family's industry to be able to reach my name? And it seems that I don't seem to fit in with the military power. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not 'you family' but 'our family'"The prime minister corrected the expression of the fat on his face, both warm and affectionate. If the Duke is like a kind businessman, he is a philanthropist.""Dukes do not forget that we are all family members.We have always been very clear about your ability.Letting you come to handle these things is also a matter of time, but now it’s just a shortage of people, so please come over and host the big picture.These are just our chores, but it’s never going to be blameless.When he said that ‘housework’, the voice was unconsciously pulled more timid and naturally very affectionate. It seems that this is a natural reason and there is no reason and room for evasion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really feel that this is inconvenient for the prime minister." The Duke still insisted on his own position.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you still see this?"The prime minister shows a little blame."But this is not a resentful exposition, but like a flirtatious, because it’s kind, it’s so unobtrusive."So be itClavis will be able to come to me first to get the documents for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister of Mulak smiled after the prime minister leftThis is a relaxed smile that is just the opposite of the loyal and embarrassed expression. He turned his head and said to Crowvis: "Your uncle is a lot thinner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It must have been very annoying during this time."Crowvis is rare to show a schadenfreak smile. The Duke is in a good mood. His mood is also good.""There are a lot of people who have died in the family. There are a few of them who are holding powers. He has to be busy with the aftermath.And his son, Modo, the waste, and the big squad, with a Guardian officer, brought a Guardian squad to kill the sergeant, or was he doing this when he was attacked by the vampire.If it wasn’t for him that he sold his old life to protect his son, the guy should have been defamed.However, his trust in him has already dropped to the lowest point. If there is any mistake, maybe even the position of the prime minister can't be saved? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The position of the prime minister..." The duke’s slender eyes smashed and enjoyed the light.Just like a gourmet in front of a delicate dish, you must first look at it and smell it in your mind."It’s just a matter of time before someone else is sitting in this position.Your uncle used to be a little disappointing to me. Now I think that temporarily using my name to cover the wind and rain shows that he really realized that he is dead end.Hehe probably thought that I was a good use of the umbrella and thought it was a good idea." The Duke was very satisfied and nodded almost to laugh out."I also think this is a good way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Necromancer Society is helping us a lot. Just a vampire will make the Elni family's powers have gone down a thousand miles. OpportunityWhen Clausue said this, he smiled and didn’t feel awkward. He even forgot his last name.The Duke is his idol, his spiritual godfather is a manifestation of the materialization of the power means he admires.In his own subconscious, he is a dog of the Duke, not even a dog. It is simply the shadow of the Duke.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis asked: "But through this incident, the political power of the church suddenly increased.What is the situation now, what should we do? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing to rush to do at least in the public"The Duke shakes his head.""Just like the situation you just said is not completely clear.Bishop Ronis has always said that the political affairs have suddenly become active and that our dangerous friends have also revealed their faces. He and the church have been attached to the attention of the rest of the country and even other countries.Although their energy seems to be not political yet, how will they show up in the future? What about the relationship with the military? We must not expose ourselves to the big picture until these conditions are completely clear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand"Clauvis nodded."Even if the Duke forgets the specific content of these words in the future, he can repeat it without fail.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke went on to say: "But we can’t really do nothing.Because our situation is generally a good one.My capable daughter, your wife, has a perfect performance in the critical situation of the hunting. This is really a surprise.His Majesty gave her a knighthood and financial office. Although I did not ask her for the sake of maintaining a clean image, there is no doubt that it will be very helpful to us in the future.And now that I have a stable military position, it is like a mountain. So in such a chaotic situation, the opportunities abound.We must not waste such a good opportunity to do everything in our actions to push things to the way we expect.He showed a very proud mysterious expression."It’s a bit confusing to do it. You don’t have to move yourself to the table. You can’t reveal what it’s like.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Clavis nodded convincedly. For these clever words and explanations, he must not think of ways to imprint on his own soul. The gift that his uncle had just handed over was the perfect result of his wise tactics. This is far more effective than a knife and a gun that is laborious to do things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Mulak was only very casual in the meeting of the military ministers the day before yesterday that the Tierni family has been using its political power to monopolize in commercial trade. Crazy money. These things were not known to outsiders, but Kravis was not an outsider and had been careful about these. So the Duke said that although not many sentences are essential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dictation of the Duke’s eloquence is naturally in the right circumstances, it seems that it is not so careless to say anything. But as soon as they fell into the ears of the ministers who had been hostile to the El Ni family looking for an opportunity to beat the dogs, they naturally care about this. So things went all the way. Dangdang, these things were silently sent into the hands of the Duke adults who had never been able to fly the shit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the Duke can finally comfortably breathe a sigh of relief and mention the spirit to prepare for the show. It’s not just because this time the plan will make his property soaring for the future. It’s also a reason to make up for a huge flaw in the past to save him from sleeping. Difficult worries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Duke had spent a long time focusing on the action of this pot, so there was no movement in other areas. Since it is no longer possible to do this for those who know too much, he will only eliminate all traces of all the evidence that previously used to conceal the information for Oufu. This is definitely a nuisance or even an impossible task for others. But fortunately, with the ability of the Duke Zhuo, it took a lot of effort and effort to do it perfectly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now Oufu is working hard to make a good relationship with the country and the Duke really did not get any great benefits in the establishment of Oufu. No evidence, no matter who. It is impossible to believe that the Duke had colluded with Oufu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now everything has been done. These industries of the Elni family can greatly enhance the strength of the Duke and can be of great utility to the Duke of the Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Clovis came to the Prime Minister’s Office, it was the dusk prime minister who was eating alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are coming. Come over and talk about it." Even if you are eating fine food, the prime minister is a bit tired and greets his nephew. . Probably it was this time that had drained his heart and no effort was spent on these superficial efforts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the talk, the prime minister’s first preparation was to drive away the amazing number of servants around. In the expansive dining room, there are several chef pastry chefs and bakers ready to deal with the appetite of the Prime Minister. At the table, there are three servants responsible for the meat-cutting and four other specially trained servants who are responsible for picking up the amazing number of dishes on the table and assembling them in the most beautiful way on a plate. In the end, there were two more clothes on the body than Krauss, who were wearing a uniform, fake powdered waiter to serve the prime minister to send these things into the import. If you don't want to enjoy these wonderful things, how to get rid of the taste under your own efforts, then the prime minister will probably even find someone to serve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is by no means a big scene but just a daily light. The appetite of the prime minister has already broken a lot, so there are only forty dishes in one meal. These servants are also minimally reduced and completely insulted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime minister’s contempt for the Duke of Mulak has mostly been due to the lack of the Duke’s style. For a person who does not need a servant to serve food, but also pays attention to the bread, even if he is so busy, how can he use the banquet of gold and silver tableware in the luxurious mansion to feast the minister’s bones, but it is only a rural tyrant. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the form has forced him to bow to this township, and the adults are also slouched, and the books and documents that have already been prepared and the seal of the family’s tokens are given. Clause said quite a bit helplessly to him: "It’s really awkward to say that you were the most talented and promising person in the younger generation of our family. But because of your father’s relationship, everyone is alienated. There is some prejudice against you"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis has no words or expressions. This is his indifference to the family from childhood. But he also saw that his uncle really felt that he had nowhere to go. Because people often only have to be lazy when they are lazy to tell the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time in his life, Clause smiled at his uncle: "If you feel relieved, give it to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enjoy you." For the first time, the prime minister is also feeling that this dice is useful even though there is a father who has lost his family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turned away from Clovis and walked sneer at the wide and far-reaching corridor in the Prime Minister's Office. He can fully understand the intent of his uncle. But now he has something in his hands that represents family power and has no sense of accomplishment and gratification or even hope for anything. He knew that he and the Duke couldn't use much time and effort to turn these documents and seals into something completely unrelated to the Elni family. His heart was full of the success and satisfaction of revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the rules of the family, those things should have been his father and then passed on to him. However, because his father was an out-and-out family, he had to hand it over to his uncle to prepare for a family. And because of his father's sake, he was exhausted and cold-eyed by the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not expect the words that his uncle’s mouth told the family to pass to him, even if he was in the subconscious, he would not rise a little. Resent the meaning of the Duke. One is very clear that the gap in strength is like the rabbit does not think that he can eat a lion. The most important thing is that he is spiritually attached to the Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a cry from the woman in the room next to him and a beating to interrupt his thoughts. Clavis frowned and listened to the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather is not hot but the people in this room are all naked. A few women huddled in the huge bed and trembled to see a man in the corner of the room beating a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man’s limbs are thin and look like they don’t have much strength, but they are like a crazy dog, biting, scratching, tearing and kicking on the woman’s white body. He also yelled while playing and yelling: "I told you to do it. If you dare not fight you, you still dare to stop." The woman did not dare to resist and only managed to protect her face while crying and screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing at my house?" The prime minister stared at Clovis at the door. This time his father managed to save his life but also taught him a good fight. This is the first time he has been taught since he was born. This makes him angry and mad only to vent the fire on these women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis was too lazy to answer the things that shook his hands like a demonstration. In the past, this waste often showed him in various ways and took advantage of the things his father had. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waste is also aware of the recent situation. I did not express any hostility to this demonstration. I only thought about it suddenly. "You come in and we discuss things and you help me a favor." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis walked in, although he certainly didn't mean to help, but also wanted to hear what was going on. This is the first time this waste has been for him." Requested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roll. All roll for me." Moto kicked all the women out on the face of the beaten woman. Lawless said: "Let me the dozens of people in your holy Knights to kill me." He twisted his voice and distorted. "I must kill the guy, I must do it anyway. Just for this, my father hit me. Do you know? He hit me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clavis just couldn't help but sneer. After all, waste is waste. This time, it has not been learned. And what kind of team is the Paladin? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what he cares most is that the tone of the waste is still so arrogant that he seems to be not helping him. He sneered a little: "Why can I help you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mado's tone is not soft, it is a little condescending, it seems that it can help him. An honour given. The true dude is that no matter what kind of situation, you must have a temper. "You don't think that the situation in our family is not good now. I tell you that if our family is back in the future, it is still my father's father. Do you think that your father who is idle and unemployed has that qualification? And finally the family business still has It’s not like it’s coming to me. So it’s absolutely right that you are standing with me now.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis smiled happily. He sneered at the idiot in front of him, because he was finally able to stand at the peak of the winner and despise the demonstrations that now seem ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
