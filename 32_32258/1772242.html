			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stop what do you want to do to the Queen?" The old Marquis of Minsk looked at the pastor and drank. Just now, Rhodes’s character of breaking this person’s identity has already brought the hearts of everyone to the eyes of the blind. And now he has reached the Queen's bed and stretched out the hand that had just shot Rodhart and flew out of the queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s natural for her to tell you what’s going on here.” The man faintly took a deep breath and then put it on The hand on the queen lighted the magic light. This is a black mist of magical fluctuations like a dark ink. This black breath instantly permeates the Queen's body and slowly infiltrates into her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling that with the emergence of this magical fluctuation, everyone can seem to have a gloomy corpse in the space of the entire bedroom. Even if people here have never seen this kind of magic, they can guess what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dead Magic?" All the ministers exclaimed that the look that was already full of horror was even more confusing. Lord Jensen, Marquis of Minsk and General Thomas, rushed forward at the same time, even though they knew that they could be similar to the worms in the face of the murder of Roland’s pro-disciples, but there was no hesitation. Because the above is the Queen's Majesty. Even if it has become a vampire, it is still the most beloved of the emperor who guarded the empire for the rest of his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one person stopped in front of them and compared to them, the skinny body was knocked open by the three people. But they used the greatest strength to desperately block them three. The man screamed and said loudly to the three of them: "Don't believe him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us believe in him? It seems to be the one who killed the Bishop of Ronis and The murderer of the Duke’s adult is the undead magic you can’t see?” General Thomas screamed to pull the man away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this man desperately pushed the general’s huge body up and looked at the three old ministers with a clear, firm look: "You don't believe it." He believes that I can always do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reason for people to stop. If it is other people, blocking and speaking will definitely have no effect but this person The most imperial prime minister is the Queen's sister, who is the only person who cares about the Queen here, so she is qualified to say this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the Queen’s body on the bed is completely invisible. From that person’s hand, the black magic wave has changed the bed into a small piece of thick The black mud of death. The sweat drenched from the forehead of the priest in front of the bed and gathered on the chin. It seemed to be very difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three old ministers were stopped by the prime minister and stopped looking at the scene in front of them. Other ministers were also helpless. They only fled out and lay on the ground. The ground supports the body. Smear a little bit of blood and yell at the outside with the loudest possible voice: "All Paladins listen to orders. Stop this personality killing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact The three swordsmen who came to him and said that he had just summoned him had already entered the bed of the temple and rushed to the bed. The prime minister adults want to leave and stop, but the three swordsmen’s hands are very good and they have passed by. Hundreds of members of the Paladins, hundreds of meters away from the temple, also began to come here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person’s hand in front of the bed is still pressed on the queen’s body and does not retract the black magic. The fluctuations are thicker, darker and more dead. The sweat on his head is getting more and more many. But at this time, the three swords of the three swordsmen had already hit the front of the child. Although these three swords are more like the swords and killings of the previous torrents of Rhodes, they are by no means easy to deal with. Any swordsman in the sacred paladin can definitely take it straight. Master" word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person did not move the body and did not let go of the Queen just raised another hand that had just received the Rhodesart sword and is now full of blood. The scars in the palms are deep enough to show that the injuries caused by the bones of the sword are definitely more serious than the seemingly superficial appearance of the disciples of the head of the Roland team. No one can easily take it. Now the magical fluctuations of this person's other hand are so strong that even the ministers who do not use magic in the temple feel that they are relatively opposite. The white temperament of his hand is barely visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three swords with three dazzling brilliance and arrogance have already stabbed him in front of him. One of his chests was stabbed to his abdomen. Even though no one had voiced orders and reminded the samurai swordsmen that they had already cooperated with each other, the offensive was still the biggest effect. There are three different directions of attack and there are some subtle time differences between the three different angles. This is ten times more difficult than the three swords in the same direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sword was broken, the swordsman’s body shape was also smashed, and the man’s elbow hit the swordsman’s chin. The face of the swordsman was instantly deformed and sprayed with blood and teeth. The half of the broken sword flew down and hit the sword that stabbed him on the abdomen. The sword of this long sword was another glimpse. The man's feet also took advantage of the gap between the shackles on the swordsman's shoulder. The swordsman also threw the ball back in the cracked bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of this hand is not too big and even worse than the lethality of any swordsman's sword. However, the timing, the position and the manner of the shots were all precisely and subtly, and the attack of the two swordsmen was completely defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these two swordsmen are just paving the way and prefixing them. His hand has been entertained and his hands have already been kicked out. The balance of the body has not been maintained at this time, but the sword in the chest has arrived and he can no longer stop hiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, this person still did not let go of the Queen’s hand, but used the standing one foot to fully twist the shaft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jianfeng has broken the clothes inside. With this twisting, he also pulled a deep wound of nearly a inch of blood on his chest. Spilled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Jianfeng is half an inch deep, he can definitely pull his chest through the gap between the ribs. But this swordsman has no way to puncture his sword. The muscles in front of Jianfeng are full of elasticity and resistance. And the degree and direction of this person's twisting and twisting the chest almost completely dispelled the power of his former stab. Finally, the sword pierced from the chest and pulled out from the chest after pulling a scar. And the distance between the swordsman and this person has been pulled very close to the distance that can be attacked without the need of hands and feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he twisted his chest and twisted his chest, he also slammed his head and slammed his forehead and slammed into the nose of the swordsman’s face. Directly recessed into the face. In the blood, the swordsman turned over and fell to the ground. His face was not flat. It was a concave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swinging the kick and twisting the chest and twisting the head, this one turned around in a near-dance position and stood firm again. The swordsmen of the three Paladins have fallen to his hands and have never left the Queen's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the hand that was placed on the Queen's body, the rest of his body was already soaked with blood. His palm that had received two swords had some unsatisfactory blood flowing down the broken palm to the chest. The blood from the deep scars of the grave also drenched the clothes. On his forehead, a layer of skin peeled off the traces and the blood on his face didn't know whether it was the swordsman or his own and the black magic fluctuations that were getting thicker and thicker next to it seemed to be like hell. The evil spirit that popped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person deeply breathes the dark magical fluctuations and then grows fierce. The first layer has begun to permeate the rest of the temple. There is no martial arts and resistance. The ministers have already begun to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The layer of skin that fell from the forehead was in front of his eyes. He seemed to be in the way of catching a tear with a bloody hand. The mask was pulled down to reveal another slightly thin and well-defined face below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have already been psychologically prepared for this person’s identity, but when I saw that the whole big 6 is the most famous, the most fierce and most horrible face At the time, all the ministers screamed in exclamation and a few screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the prime minister did not exclaim and screamed. She looked at his eyes with joy and gratification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black magical fluctuations that originally began to pervade suddenly shriveled and all received the Queen’s body. The Queen’s figure has disappeared completely and has become an object wrapped in a black mist. And he finally let go of his hand, although he looked tired, but he was relieved and looked at his prime minister and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsmen of the Paladin of the Temple are already close. But this is only close. After all, Rhodes Hart and Bishop Javier told them to stand too far, although their movements were quick but it seemed to be a little late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt on the ground struggled to stand up, but even standing like this is very difficult, let alone to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally all the black fluctuations were automatically collected and immersed in the Queen’s body, but this person’s face suddenly looked up and looked out of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
