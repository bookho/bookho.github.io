			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Bishop Ronis has always called on all countries to jointly form a coalition against the Necromancer. But unfortunately this plan has not been implemented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the Society of Necrops is notorious in the civil society, no country’s leaders and politicians will feel that this is a villain. In the end, they are just playing the quirky magical act of secrets. Even if the occasional killing of people and zombies, but the suppression of a peasant riots in a small country, a coup, a coup, and so on, is negligible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Holy See is also very strange in its attitude towards the Necromancer. Although it has always been hostile to this evil organization, it is only ‘representation’ and there has been no actual action. Bishop Ronis has submitted to the Pope more than once a proposal to annihilate the Necromancer Society, but there are always reasons for the plan and the proposal to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this attitude is probably still objective. The church itself does not have enough combat power to only inspire national machines to fight. And the flute valley is surrounded by the Dragon Desert and the Shadow Mountain Range, even the veteran adventurers are extremely difficult to reach, let alone the army. It is rumored that every Necromancer is a top magician and no country leader is willing to go to find trouble with these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the opposite is that an ambitious monarch once thought about wooing this mysterious hermit magician to help him dominate the world and send a famous diplomacy. The ambassadors of the family came to visit with a grand gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the peace ambassadors who were involved in the land of death actually came back safely. Not only did they take the gift they brought back, but they also brought gifts that were said to have been returned to him by the Necromancers. All of these gifts are worthless and worthy of ten times more valuable than the gifts that the monarchs called them. Just as the monarch looked at the unexpected gains and was delighted and embarrassed, those originally seemingly normal envoys suddenly went forward to screw the monarch’s head alive and not wait for the guards and ministers to In response, they actually screwed their heads down again. Then those insignificant envoys used these heads to smack blood and wrote a few large characters on the floor of the main hall. This horrible scene is said to have scared people who were present at the scene half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing to bother us. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the message that the high-ranking people of the Descartes Valley conveyed to the world through their unique means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one has ever dared to raise the idea of ​​any relationship with him. This shows how difficult it is for Bishop Ronis to create a coalition against them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s hard to be difficult. Therefore, Bishop Ronis also prepared a plan and the stage of this plan is the upcoming Royal Hunting Conference in Wangdu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royal Hunting Convention was originally a private leisure activity for the Geffenhart royal family. In the southwest of Wangdu, there are large forest pastures that are excellent hunting grounds. Every year the emperor will bring the royal aristocrats to hunt. In recent years, because of the gentle emperor’s gentle personality and the diplomatic relations between the neighboring countries, some time ago, together with the countries, they reached a consensus on Oufu and successfully resolved the dispute. The young Geffenhart XVII was in a good mood. The princes and nobles of all countries came to participate in this activity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Rooney also called the leaders again at this time. As usual, the strength and speculation of his death guild also indicates that there are indications that they will strengthen their own strength and even endanger the entire No. 6 call for everyone to unite and annihilate it. The reaction of all countries is still to regard this appeal as a paranoid and over-exciting of religious people. To respect this highly respected old man, they will not refuse to politely take some diplomatic rhetoric to congest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hunting plan is a very skillful communication method that needs to be arranged at the beginning of all plans to be very thoughtful and necessary. These things are undoubtedly not suitable for the noble and noble status of the bishop, and the Magic Academy can not find such a talent. It was just then that a friend of Bishop Rooney returned to the kingdom, so the bishop of the bishop asked Asa to go to him for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is the most famous romantic figure in the Ian Fast Empire. His reputation and traces have even passed the national borders in the entire big 6 and no one dares to look back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was young, he was the most infatuated, and the prince once ran for dozens of the best horses for a favorite woman. The wilderness of the werewolf was only to send a unique flower that she wanted to see in the Sandefés. He is also the most slick and the most unruly waver. During the day, he and the innocent girl, Shanmeng vows, alone in the evening, and the entire brothel and prostitutes indulge in carnival. He is also the most devastating dream lover of the most elegant princes who have the mysterious charm of the prince charming. Numerous aristocratic women madly train their own dances to make themselves thinner. The nose is higher. The eyes are more sexy. Don’t hesitate to ask the priest and Gao Ming’s butcher to come to the knife. These are just for the opportunity to dance with him at the dance. The song lets him remember his name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also been a talented writer. The poetry he wrote was even the most tasteful person, and he also praised the scripts he created in the Royal Theatre. He is a maverick artist who despise the world. I used to spend a lot of money to sell a lot of precious art to do an exhibition and then smashed those things in the face of the public, saying that these are fake, and then put a huge painting of their own in the once valuable city. The fragment says that this is the real art. This move made all the artists and him break off from it - that is, the painting of the woman's lower body, which is extremely realistic, is a hymn written by him called "The Gate of the World." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the strangest thing about this person’s various deeds is that he is actually a friend with Bishop Ronis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two people with different personalities are really incredible regardless of their chances of not being mutually exclusive. Probably such a wave of sluts also have deep concealed feelings in the depths of the heart or the bishop may not be completely old-fashioned. And objectively speaking, there are also many places in the bishops who want to take advantage of this versatile and complex friend, for example. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely a wonderful person full of mysterious charm. But when Asa went to see him, his mood was a bit unnatural. Because he is the famous Marquis of Herm. According to the seniority and family rules, it is the father of Clause, the family member of the Elni family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is certain that the relationship between the father and the son is definitely a stranger. The completely different personality and values ​​are the perfect evidence that Klauvis’s wedding has never seen this honorable father. Although the nominal family member was despised in the Elni family, it was almost unbelievable that the father did not attend the son's wedding in accordance with the aristocratic etiquette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa came to the Marquis. Compared with the bureaucrats of Wangdu, it is not conspicuous or even a bit chilly and the grandeur of the Duke’s House is in stark contrast. Asa showed the identity of the old man who opened the door, and the old man took him directly and saw the Marquis in a very simple living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Asa saw the Marquis, he understood that the handsomeness of Clovis was the inheritance of the father. But the temperament of the two fathers and sons is completely different. The Marquis has a somewhat thin face with a deep, melancholy and very nice-looking eyes. The nose can be like a smile. The younger lips must be a handsome man with a glamorous man, but now he will mature. It blends with the charm of flying outside. This is definitely the first person who can attract others and see how many eyes are not bored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa first bowed to the Marquis and said: "The Marquis is an order from the Bishop of Ronis to discuss something with you."<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a good ritual of this ritual." The marquis's long, eyebrows are ticked up. This is a bit too delicate for men. Eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven’t seen such a clergyman who hasn’t done anything for a long time." Marquis’s eyes were smiling. He has a pair of young people's eyes, even if they are over 40 years old, they can't find any signs of old age. They don't even see a wrinkle in their eyes. They laugh very much. He is very generous in expressing his goodwill towards Asa. "I like people like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is a little blushing. In general, he rarely feels embarrassed even when facing a girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay. Let's go to the study room." The Marquis patted Asa's shoulders naturally like the old friends of many years without the slightest creation. "Since Bishop Ronis has asked you to come to me, it means that you must be talking about someone he trusts. It is probably something he can't solve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Marquis in the study sighed after listening to the plan of Bishop Ronis: "I don't think that my noble and high-ranking friend must use the dirty means used by these politicians." He showed a very charming smile to Asa. "But I believe he must have noble reasons such as for light and justice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for this sinister bishop's 'dirty' quirky sigh Asa didn't know what to say. I had to sneak a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis pondered for a while and looked a little uplifting. "Do you know what the script I used to write is the classic drama of the Royal Theatre but there is a regret that I have not yet directed a real drama. Isn't this a good opportunity now? What kind of scenery and scene ratio? It’s the reality of this big stage. This is the real art of flesh and blood.” He blinked a little at Asa’s eyes and nodded. "You are waiting to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Absolutely not a good student.” Marquis said with a hand: “I was expelled.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh? Why?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I blame their virgin images for their engravings are completely wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mother of the nursery rhyme has a pair of women who have a very good sex life. This is of course wrong." The Marquis said very uncomfortably in the tone of the expert. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So they fired you?" Asa was very uncomfortable for the great predecessor of the Marquis Magic Academy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis said innocently: "My suggestion that they don't listen to me would have to do it myself. I have other statues of the Virgin in the cathedral* * All broke and then squeezed the flour with the flour. *The woman should have the chest up. As a result, they fired me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha ha ha ha ha "Asa laughed." He determined that the School of Magic must have made such punishment on the face of the Elni family, if not because the daring predecessor of this prominent family should pay for his insights on the stake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing the business, the two continued to chat in the study room for a while and then became as familiar as the good friends of many years. The priests of the Marquis who did not recite the temporary promotion of Asa’s sacred book were greatly appreciated. Those priests who are justified by the rules are simply wood. Only when they are unconstrained like him, they know that they have true The temperamental talent will improve the boring air of the School of Magic. And Asa thinks this person is too cute and too amiable. Perhaps the reason why Clause is so annoying is probably because the father is not willing to pass on these lovely places to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, Asa had already left the Marquis to send him out in the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road, the Marquis suddenly said: "Although I am a little sorry for you, but there is one thing out of my beauty, I must say."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa frowning asks: "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis sighed and said, "You know what the clergyman’s clothes are. It’s so unattractive to wear on you that it’s too uncoordinated to be stranger than wearing a gauze skirt for meat.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh? I don’t really wear it. Clothes." Asa could not help but look down at himself. This original solemn cleric uniform he just puts on his body and wears pajamas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not wearing." The Marquis's eyes cast the artist's radiant gestures to show the poet's demeanor. "It's temperament. The combination of character and vitality can't be influenced by clothes or any other foreign objects. The taste on your body is not in line with the dull religion." He looked at Asa. "The natural rate is really unknown or unwilling to cover up and suppress if it is necessary to say that the right career for you is probably a rogue or a robber."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa A burst of laughter with his solemn identity. With this person, he laughs more than he is happy at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis immediately reached out and made a full of character. "You see that this kind of bold laughter is clearly the patent of the green forest heroes. The idiots who recite the holy books can never laugh so happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm sorry." The Marquis suddenly sighed and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Asa didn't understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I came back too late. It was too late to destroy the ugly marriage." The Marquis was apologetic. "A good girl like Ms. Mucker should definitely marry someone like you, not the son of my goose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is stunned and sly Looking at him is not what a father should say anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Duke of Mulak and the members of my family are all vulgar and powerful animals, even those who have been hoeing for a lifetime are more beautiful than they are. They don't know that in such an ugly world, only the love of pure men and women is the only good thing. And it is too ugly for them to destroy the love between two young people who are so beautiful for those powers and money. "The length of this family is not flat with the poet's feelings and accents for his wife and daughter-in-law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
