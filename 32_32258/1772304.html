			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Destiny?嘿......." The Pope narrowed his eyes and seemed to recollect this unique mysterious charm, then he saw Look at the Marquis and say, "I didn't hear these words for the first time. Someone mentioned it in front of me more than 20 years ago. That was the last Pope, Deken. You know him because of Ham?" The prince nodded: "Deken was not only the pope at the time, but also recognized as the first strongest in the mainland. Unfortunately, I was too young to see the legend. The figure of the character."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, on the magical cultivation, Dekan’s white magic and fire magic are both repaired. One of the great magicians. Even if it is not magic, his skill is among the top ten masters in the mainland. The identity of the mainland's first strongman is unquestionable. During his reign, I was at the time, Ronis, Ai Schar is the three major cardinals, and the glory of Celeste is also the most widely spread and the most powerful person in the mainland. Innocent. Inham, you said, is such a person arguably a person who has gathered strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." The Marquis nodded. Such a person can say whatever he is. In fact, in the minds of most people at the time, His Majesty the Pope was no longer a human being. Even the Lord in heaven does not have the brilliance of his own spokesperson in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said this before Ahibad’s prophecy in front of me. He also said that he had seen the fate and that his fate had already been held by him. In his hand, he is going to step on this prophecy to overload the most powerful magician of the history, Agibad, and to pull up the dark star that no one can pull up." The pope smiled slightly. It seems that <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is in the midst of nostalgia. Perhaps he was too immersed in his own memories. Perhaps he really regarded the new cardinal in front of him as an all-cooperative ally. His words are absolutely impossible for others to listen to. "But unfortunately, this The strong man who thought that his fate had stepped on his feet, and finally died. He did not even fall on the road he believed to conquer the fate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't see what fate Don't put too much prophecy on your mind. Look at your eyes and feet. Needless to say, go far, at least not to smash. This is the lesson I learned from him. The prophets of the sages are usually warm. Vague. The result of forcing to parse is just to cast your own wishful thinking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think I have to care about what Akibad said is separate The individual is still a group, and there is no need to manage what power is gathered. Just know that the central land must not be the place where the orcs began to change the world." The pope stood up from the seat and had a light in his eyes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe this is a good statement. The analysis of the sages is actually just projecting yourself. This sentence is suitable for many people. The Marquis silently made a smile in his heart, but he did not show it. He just said, "Please rest assured that your Majesty, Lancelot and the Knights of the Temple have already set off. As long as they can go smoothly, then Oufu is also less than two or three years later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, this is really thanks to you. Inham, Oufu really if The annihilation is not annihilated by me, it is by you." His Majesty the Pope looked at the Marquis for the first time truly appreciated and slightly grateful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, another letter from the Dragonfly from Celeste appeared on the table of the city of Cedros. The contents of the letter are that all seven Knights of the Temple, including Lancelot, have disappeared from the Glorious Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no fewer lions in the castle, and there is no news of the Knights of the Temple. It seems that it can be inferred that the seven of them left the Celeste with a transfer reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter made Cedrus a very bad brain. It's not that every secret letter from Celeste has to pay the price of hundreds of gold coins, but he really can't understand where the seven Knights of the Temple will go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Includes Lancelot. These seven Knights of the Temple are all top-notch masters, which represents the highest fighting power of the church. The task of using these seven people to perform silently is indeed very nerve-wracking to think about what is necessary. The number of transmission magic arrays on the mainland is also counted. Exclusions can also be used to remove places where the Knights of the Temple can go. But the most valuable places are not likely to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diya Valley? Regardless of whether they have so many Diya Valley transmission reels, even if there are a lot of Twelve Shrines, it is no different to dare to go there directly. The enchantment of the Dark Star is not as gentle as the Sunwell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
