			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 40,000-strong army has already concentrated its grain reserves in Bracada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-term annihilation of the orcs smashes the number of orcs in the wild highlands by General Sanders. These remaining orcs are probably the total number of cubs and youths who had previously fled into the Sandefies Mountains during the killings, never exceeding one or two thousand. Even now, the group has joined some of the unspeakable big ear monsters and has some equipment. But the disparity in this force is dozens of times and the magic of the magician in the army is always the most effective weapon against the orcs. As long as the general ordered the 40,000 troops to immediately smash the beast's nest to the ground like a broken bed bug. This kind of thing has been very skilled in the past ten years. He is very confident and well done. And the anger in the chest also makes him want to hear that the beasts are dying, and the head of an orc is stepping on the foot and pushing out the 'ka bar' to let the brain and blood splash together. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even then the general did not let his emotions and self-confidence cover up the reason. When he left the South, he ordered a team of people to arrive in Bracada as soon as possible and then went to the city-state for reconnaissance and temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war is, after all, the war is the life of thousands of people related to the rise and fall of a country is not a game for the personal emotions of the will. The general knows this very well. From the age of ten, he rolled on the battlefield until the empire was almost in the war with the surrounding countries 20 years ago. The war experience and judgment he trained in them were the officers who graduated from the knight school. Unpredictable. On the battlefield, being a general can never be a brave weapon but a wisdom and calm. So even if he has a lion-like temper, he can calm down like a dry nut without any moisture as soon as he comes into contact with the military. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is also very aware that the orcs do not use magic but their physical and combat strength is very good, especially the ogre and the werewolf are not comparable to ordinary humans. If you have good equipment, you will have a strong tactical formation and strategy. Before the offense, it is best to clarify the situation there, what kind of equipment the orcs have, what kind of system will be used, and what kind of attack method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general knows that this battle is very important. The struggle of the forces in the DPRK has reached a point of enthusiasm. The people of the Elni family were not satisfied with the economic and political ones and wanted to get the military power. They have been planning to let them step down and send them to a faction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Emperor’s youth is too young to be too fond of those who are good at drilling. Therefore, the military ministers have always fallen in the political struggle. If this military operation can be successfully and successfully completed, the orc’s lair will be annihilated, then the military’s forces can regain the upper hand in the struggle in the DPRK, and the Elni family’s forces can be completely removed from the army. All business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if the failure of the Elni family will definitely take this opportunity to touch their long-lost military power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So even the superior general of the military is still very cautious to send the reconnaissance troops to explore the situation first. But what is strange is that the troops have been out for more than ten days without a slight echo. So a few days ago, the general sent another small number of investigative units to reconnoiter in the depths of the highlands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was finally news back today, but only a few reconnaissance soldiers came back. One of the recruits just turned over and shouted: There are monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bittered for more than ten days but waited for such a report that the generals who were scared and cried when they walked the night, all burst into flames. Just hit the soldier's head like a tomato thrown on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he immediately calmed down and immediately asked what other soldiers saw. The report is the same: there is a huge monster accumulated by the corpse in the wild highland. The reconnaissance unit originally wanted to get close to the view but the flames spurted by the monster burned even the corpses without leaving only the farthest. I escaped without being affected by the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals who listened to the report were hard to see, and the legs of several scouts were also screaming. Finally, the general finally turned to several adjutants and said: "Call the git that called Nags to roll over to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adjutant ran out of the camp but behind Then the roar of the general was heard. "Stand up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A monster made up of corpses. According to the general's experience, this was probably made by the Necromancer Association. When he was young and fighting with other countries, he saw some patterns that they used to play with their bodies. He didn't know that the Necromancers had come here to do this time and didn't have time to go deeper. He now has all the spirits concentrated on the orc city-state. If there are obstacles in front, you must clean them up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nags is also a member of the Elni family and is the eldest son of today's prime minister. This time, although he was sent by the Magic Academy to assist the dispatching of the magicians, it was actually to supervise the troops. What small scorpion he had captured the general could naturally make a fuss about it, and if he succeeded in winning the orc city-state, he could count the military power. For the future, their family forces will lay the foundation for the exhibition in the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nagos sergeant himself has not been on the battlefield until he was 30 years old, although the main attention has been concentrated on the flamboyant life of Wangdu. But I also studied at the School of Magic and Military Academy for a while. Undoubtedly, he also knows that one aspect of his mission in the military is naturally to leave all the actions of the generals on the one hand and to show impetuousness in rushing to merit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can, the general will never talk to him. But dealing with the physical damage of undead undead monsters, swords and swords, is not the most effective means of attack. The general did not directly direct the rights of the magicians. The magicians are not part of the army. They are the same as the pastor. The power of the Academy of Magic to support the army is customary. Only the officers in the army have the right to mobilize. Normally, the church's priests will listen to the experienced military officers, but this is no doubt the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general will not know the truth after seeing the reaction of Nags. When I heard that a huge undead monster appeared in the wilderness and killed a lot of soldiers, his face was very exhilarating. His face was clearly written with the words 'I finally made my merits.' He ordered the magicians in all the troops to gather together to destroy the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general does not agree. The magician is the most aggressive and most vulnerable of the troops. If there is damage, it will have a huge impact on the combat effectiveness of the troops. This time, the orc magician plays a decisive role in the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Nags sect is determined to do so. The general will take a step back and suggest that at least the situation of the undead monster should be touched first. So what exactly is a monster that appears here if there is someone who manipulates it and what it wants to do. After clarifying these, we will study the countermeasures and then act again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nags the priest is very disapproving that the general’s indecisiveness is just a delay. Regardless of whether it is the orc or the guild of the Necromancer, there is a huge undead monster, but it is also a piece of meat accumulated by the corpse. As long as enough magic power is concentrated, it can be fried. In this way, the orc can also be written on the deterrent's book, and it is better to call it after the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general used a lot of effort to vent his temper. He almost wanted to kill the leader who was eager for quick success. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clear that under the mentality of the priest's eagerness to make meritorious deeds, the general consideration of the general's cautious incompetence has been undone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer is almost a public enemy of all countries. It is a synonym for evil. If you can solve the huge monster created by a Necromancer, it is not just military merit but also The status in the church will be greatly enhanced. This is simply a gift from God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nags the priest immediately began to summon the magician in the army to plan to appear tomorrow as if the undead monster would suddenly disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle does not go wrong. It’s not just about the political struggle in the DPRK but also the rise and fall of the Empire. The general did not want to see the imperial power falling into the hands of the aristocrats who only knew how to use power. They did not want to see them squeeze a group of old ministers who had made great contributions to the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general himself quietly went to the woods outside the city of Bracada to find a place where no one was punching and kicking the trees and playing Eni All the family members, including the ancestors, used a poisonous language to lick a dog's blood until they vented their anger almost to find the priest and asked to go out with the unit. He did not trust the elite of this team to be completely handed over to such an idiot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days, the troops led the scouts and did not use much effort to show the monster. Huge footprints and strong odors are road signs. It took a long time to trace the monster along the track. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general took a long iron tube from his arms. This is the gift that the Duke of Mulak gave him through the head of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s position in the DPRK’s position has always been on the military side. He is also a soldier and has won the trust of other military ministers. Although his daughter is about to marry a son of the Elni family, everyone believes that it is only a matter of personal affection among the children. It is well known that the Duke has been working hard to make money for the military. For example, such a gift makes people feel that the Duke is still a soldier in the front line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a wonderful thing that the masters of the dwarf artisans can see through the distance. This is indeed very useful for combat. The general is very grateful to the Duke for his intention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general was clearly seen through the iron tube general. The overall outline of this monster is actually the dragon that only appeared in the legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body that has been accumulated by countless bodies is the reconnaissance unit that was sent out half a month ago from the costumes of those bodies. The soldiers who had been living in the dragon and the tigers squeezed each other out and the many prominent limbs had rotted. The movement of the monster shook like the body hair of the monster. Sometimes a distorted face is exposed in a distorted body. Numerous such deadly images combine to form a huge monster of their own activity. This is exactly the death that is active. The thick corpse smell did not attract the corpse eagle. All the creatures felt instinctively afraid of this monster's breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of the eccentric sluts is accompanied by the smell of a thick corpse that pervades the air, and the atmosphere of a horrible horror is enough to make anyone feel creepy. Even the generals who have long been used to killing scenes feel that they are a little cold on their backs. He felt that this was not a simple thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nags the priest also saw this huge monster through the iron tube and his face began to green. He even saw the illustrations of the zombies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that this monster is not harmful to our army for the time being. We will withdraw the troops and report to the Magic Academy for them to send a full-time pastor to this. The monster looks at the analysis and talks about it." The general saw the face of the priest and helped him make the decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Nagist priest was furious: "What kind of military is the enemy in the face of retreat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if you don't know what it is, it will take a lot of effort to attack these magicians. If the troops have damage, what should you do? Are you all in one's head?" The general's anger finally came out and roared toward the official. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nags sergeant subconsciously flinched the military of the soldiers who lived on the line of life and death, and the momentum of the soldiers lying in the women’s piles could not be countered. However, the priests immediately felt that they could not be shocked by such a martial arts. In order to recover his self-respect, he turned to his deputy command: "Through my command, all the assaults in the name of the Holy God will destroy this evil monster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Stand still." The general's roar fixed the footsteps of this deputy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here I am the commander, they are all my people. It’s my command to pass the order." The gods gathered courage and confronted the general. In the minds of the subordinates, after all, the command took the upper hand and he ran to the troops under the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incapable of watching hundreds of magicians rushing toward the monster. The general slammed the fire in the eyes of the sergeant and said, "You better hope that this monster can be solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magicians Zema quickly approached the corpse dragon and didn't seem to care too much about the small things that seemed to be ants-like. It was a few days ago that it easily burned dozens of such things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has no thinking ability. Its powerful magical power also makes it reject all commands. It is now just looking for the instinct in the earth according to the magical array that created it. The flow of magic went towards the northwest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magicians rushed into the magic range. With the command of several intermediate wizards, the outline of the corpse dragon is completely submerged in the flash and the flames. A variety of attacking magic creates a collision explosion on the body of the corpse. The fireball's explosion of flames, the white light of the burning lightning, and the whistling and shattering of the sizzling ice arrows have become a spectacular show of magic. Each of these explosions shines every time, and every whistle has the power to knock down an ogre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A green wave suddenly burst out of the beautiful magical fireworks and immediately drowned all the other flashing sounds with his majestic momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a few blinks of effort. The green waves are running out of the wilderness to restore peace as if nothing had ever been born. The wind blew through a large piece of black scorched earth centered on the corpse dragon. The slight whistling of the scorched earth was empty and there was nothing. The spectacular magic scene just seemed to be an instant illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the corpse dragon did not leave any traces. The enormous magical power and life energy contained in these bodies make it more ten-fold stronger than the magically processed soft armor. No magic or physical attack will have any effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been a while for a while, Nags’s officer reached out and hugged his head and shook his head and shouted, “How could this be?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general had a big casserole fist hitting his face with a cracked bone and he flew far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nags priests led the army to destroy the huge undead monsters. Unfortunately, the troops led by him led the army to the battlefield. The general has already thought about the contents of the report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most powerful weapon magic school that deals with the orc force has spent countless hours of talent to recover. The generals were shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of Ronis, who was watching all this standing on another distant hill, was also shaking slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I regret very much now that I really regret it." Bishop Ronis bowed his head and repeated his words with a deep accent. It seems that this must be the case. . "I regretted helping to make such a monster come out." The hundreds of magicians who were burned to death were all students who were trained by the School of Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the most painless death. They may not even have the time to think about death. This is a perfect way to die. Teacher, you don't need to be sad for them." Ved Nina's body is just a body, but her voice is forced out of her throat with air magic. Although it is hard to hear, but also with a sense of color, she can hear her. It is not very ridiculous that she is very serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ronnis turned to look at her a pair of nephews that had been completely burned by anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The teacher doesn't need to be angry. When they die, it proves to others that our masterpiece is perfect. It's just over a hundred lives. This as a warning can save the death of thousands of ordinary soldiers. Isn't that a good deal?" Vidnina talked. “Did the teachers feel bad because they are disciples of the School of Magic? I remember that the teacher used to teach me that my life was not expensive.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A Lich How can such a deadly monster know the meaning of life." Bishop Ronis turned back and sighed. He still clearly remembers the appearance of this student twenty years ago. It is very lively, energetic and beautiful, so that everyone who sees can't bear to associate her with the concept of 'death'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Teacher is wrong. As long as it exists, it will inevitably destroy or inevitably die. I just changed the form of my life structure and no longer aging." And I became like this because I was too afraid of death. I was afraid that time would kill me and fear that my own life would pass outside my will, so I used this method to save my life." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The monster created by the sorcerer." Ronis disdain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The teacher is wrong again." Vadina continued to explain her point of view. "Where is this sorcerer? This is the crystallization of human wisdom. Human beings create various techniques to smelt and grow medicine, that is, to enable themselves to live more securely. Some longer, in other words, the wisdom of human beings has always been to fight against death. Life is nothing. What is the essential difference between the technique of creating a body that is not so old and the ordinary technology? The so-called wisdom and technology are the ways in which life is performed to continue itself. But I am more complicated and advanced in this way. So it's not easy for people who see mediocrity to accept it." She raised her hand to reveal her bones that were only wrapped in skin. "This is the life of the most advanced technology. My body is the highest embodiment of human vitality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ronnis frowned and looked at her showing off the tattered The bones see the dead gray inside the hole in the skin. The logical reasoning of his student is still so impeccable. Twenty years ago, she was recognized as a rare magical magical material with unimaginable wisdom. The end result is that she used her wisdom to recreate the rituals of ancient lost and turn herself into a lich. I don't know if she is too smart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you both have to argue for these boring things and have been arguing for more than 20 years. Actually, Shandru was very impatient and said to Vide Nina:" Is it a matter of substance? Is there any purpose for you to create that monster? Why do we want to follow it and watch this big guy move slowly and slowly? You know how long I have not gone to the teahouse to have tea chat. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s embarrassing to disturb the teacher’s elegance. As a magician, I just want to create a perfect magical art.” Ved Nina Said a little. "It’s not the responsibility of our creators to pay attention to this art."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru said: "To tell the truth, why are you The place to make this thing is here? Don't tell me that I just plan to do it temporarily. I have been here for a few days and I probably guessed what happened. The big guy is always moving towards the center of the highland. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vadrina’s first half smiled with a very strange smile. "That's because I made it instinct when I was making it. It will go from here to the center of the highland in the direction of the flow of the earth to remove some of the rubbish there. Such a magical artwork naturally has to I have to play a role that is commensurate with it, so I will let it guard the land that will become a holy place before the arrival of the king of the world. Because the new world order will rise from here."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The king of the world? New order?" Sandro slammed his mouth very hard. "Do you still believe in these vain ghosts? It's just for the idiots who are dead-headed in the guild. I take the book away so that you don't think about it all day long."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ronnis sneered: "What else can they do besides these ghosts? Do you ask them to go to the fields to find friends and chat and then have time to care about political and military issues?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vadinina smiled and said: "What's the big thing? Those are just over-the-top." She pointed to the northwest. "The city-states there have gathered the orcs who are going to genocide to use them to freely deceive them and unite the chambers of the various countries to develop a thriving scene that wants to occupy the geographical location of the central city." But love The Enfar Empire can watch the orcs who have been killing them independent. Can the surrounding countries really hope to establish a country on this high ground? Isn’t the army of the empire already here? And the victory of this war It also affects the ups and downs of the imperial politics of the imperial empire. The political situation of the ruling army is in a state of affairs. The nation is prosperous and the country is prosperous and prosperous. These are really great and beautiful words. It is enough for the ants of the ants to obsess and let the poets sing. But what do these actually count? This originally gathered so many changes in the central place that it will immediately become ashes under the works I created. The military affairs that were originally born will naturally not exist. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think you are already a god?" Ronis was cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not a god. There is no God at all in this world. I have only passed these mortal worlds. I have seen the glitz of the world is a bubble." Everything is just some of the small gears in this whole world exhibition. The world has already decided its own direction from the beginning. The result is already destined. Why should you indulge those meaningless things? Her voice was so loud because she was excited. “I asked the two teachers to stay and watch. I hope that the two teachers will come to see how our works turn the unsightly garbage into fly ash to prove that everything is the same as what I said. Only what we do is in line with The rules of the world are really meaningful things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru spit out his third spit and said that he did not agree: "Sometimes true I admire you for spending so much thought and energy on these boring things. Why can't you live a little simple? Like I don't think about anything interesting to do anything. Even you ask me to do such a dangerous thing. Big guy, I just think it’s interesting, so come. Don’t always think about what to do with shit.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vadinina laughed. It is like the tone of a wolf crying. "About fun, I can tell the two teachers that a very interesting thing. I broke the classmate into the sun well and he was seriously injured by sudden death. A person who practiced real meditation was seriously injured. What will happen to the sun wells that are full of strength, I believe that the two teachers will be very clear. The wave power in the well water will be sucked away by him, that is, the ritual that the legendary elves used to resist the darkness is destroyed. And I I know that this classmate also ran out of the whispering singer with the strength. Because the two teachers did not show the surprise when they saw the leaf of the world tree, the genie who was not whispering. Let me know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
