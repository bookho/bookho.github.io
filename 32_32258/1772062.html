			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is now in the arms of the Duke’s appointment document. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t know why the Duke’s adult had entrusted him with the task of saving his daughter as he was the only savior. It is impossible to rely on the power and money of the Duke’s adults. Those green-skinned thieves would never dare to kidnap if they knew that it was a duke's daughter, but it was enough to lead an army to bring their entire village to the ground. They usually only attack some passing passers-by or small caravans and generally don't dare to hurt people. And no matter whoever brings the ransom, you can solve this problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter how the Duke thinks this is definitely a good thing. He also hopes that he can solve this matter very alone and secretly. The Duke not only sincerely asked him to save his daughter but also gave him a letter of appointment and the bishop said that it was convenient for him to act in the local area. Of course, the Duke did not directly appoint the authority of the bureaucracy. This instrument is merely proof that he is the commissioner appointed by the Duke to show that he is the Duke and can change horses at various stations along the way. . Moreover, the Duke’s reputation and power in recent years are booming. Even in remote places, this page proves to have a great deterrent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing he wanted to refrain from, but with the passing of this instrument there are ten gleaming gold coins that are just needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a bit late, he’s back to Sandro’s big house and is ready to leave tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa keeps remembering that meditation thing goes into the house and asks Sandro not to ask: "Why don't you tell me the meditation in the book?" I don’t know how to practice it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why don’t you practice?” Shandru stared at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't that a sorcerer? The bishop says that the people who practiced are dead. Do you want to kill me?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru slammed into the ground and said: "There are all idiots who are not qualified enough to practice hard. What is wrong with the things themselves? Just right." Even if the water is drunk, it will kill people. I used to practice the limits of my body and I haven’t practiced for so many years.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When When I heard that the bishop told him to destroy the book by the way, Sandrud yelled and asked, "Does he really say that?" Then he frowned and ran into the back room and handed it to Asa. "You ate it." Asa took a closer look at the hand and it was two black pills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can eat fast." Shandru patted Asa's back like a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what I dare to eat? It won't be poison."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a good medicine." Sandru made a very innocent expression of anger. "This is a good thing that I made with dozens of precious herbs and magical power. It is a hundred times better to eat and exercise. I am looking at you to complete a difficult task tomorrow, so I will give you a supplement. "Surround your strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really?" Asa sighed and smelled nothing and swallowed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A second cup of water helps digestion." Sander handed him another glass of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa slammed down and now Shandru looked at him very carefully. I feel very uncomfortable to ask: "What do you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru looked at him and confirmed that he had swallowed the medicine. It may be vomiting again and suddenly screamed: "Well, I forgot. The drug's medicinal properties are too strong and must be neutralized with another drug. Otherwise it will make your intestines suffer from pain." Die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You" Asa stared at him. "What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Another medicine, my prescription, I forgot, but it was recorded on the book. You must put that book Get it back to me as soon as possible.” He patted Asa’s shoulder and said innocently, “What do you think of me doing? I didn’t mean it. But rest assured that the drug’s effect is not so fast, it takes a long time. I believe that you can bring the book to me before the poison. You must remember not to take the book to other people, and the prescription written on it can only be understood by me"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed and sighed and patted Sandro's shoulder and said, "You can rest assured that I will give you the book and tell the bishop that the book has been destroyed." He really does not believe that he will play these tricks. The person will have a connection with the legendary Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that you are so smart, I haven’t seen it before." Shandrew was a little embarrassed and nodded and said with a very serious expression. "But that's really a very powerful poison. You have to feel the pressure before you can concentrate on it. If you see a woman, you will be faint. If the woman is holding you again, you will be screaming." The book is destroyed, does it not take your life?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nodded and said, "Well, I know, I will give the book to me." Yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two wooden doors that were touched were slammed open. A group of people came in and almost all of them were big-handed men with weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that is a thin-eyed monkey is that he stared at Asa and looked at other people and said, "It’s this guy. The young master has told him to live. However, if you break a few hands and feet, you can have five gold coins for the first time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who have just finished the voice are standing in front of you. The five gold coins swooped over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be looking for you. Slowly." Shandre turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa does not understand how these unfamiliar people will find themselves but face the countermeasures of those who rushed over with their weapons. He does not retreat into the hand and is a fireball to the head of a rushing person to go to this is almost full force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa understands that he is less likely to play more. A person with more people tends to have a dominant attitude. They are generally loose. As long as you show their unexpected strength, if you put down a few, you will have a bad morale and then you will deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fireball, although not as exaggerated as the whispering of the slang, but also has a significant improvement in the middle of the man’s chest and puts him whole They all blown up and flew out. Several people next to him were also shaken by the aftermath of the explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Going to the side to watch the lively Sandro eyes stunned and was amazed at the power of this fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other people did not pause but instead fiercely rushed over the interval of his magic. Asa knew that this group was a veteran of war. He pulled the knife out from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two swords of Asa’s two men who had just come forward came out and fired a fireball out to blow up the two people who flew over. He now feels that magic power flows freely in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time he has escaped from the whispering of the forest and it feels like he has improved a lot. The meditation and the power of the sun well gradually merged into the body, not only the magical powers, but also the wonderful effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa turned over the knife and turned over two. He doesn't want to kill people. He just uses the knife back and he doesn't take it lightly. Every time he starts, he will have a broken bone. But I didn't expect the group to be aggressive. He just turned and the big man who was cut down to the ground forced him to climb up and stab a sword behind him. But he only swayed on the robes and swayed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa head did not step back and hit the elbow. The sound of the broken face of the face and the screaming sounded at the same time. I will never climb again this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a waving long sword on the side and rushed up. Asa simply greeted him and blocked the sword directly with his arm. Then he knocked the man’s jaw down with a handle. . The backhand is another fireball. The guy who wants to sneak behind him flies out and hits the viscera and potion on the shelf of the glass bottle with various organs. The glass fragments are scattered all over the floor. Sandro snorted next to her mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the other style of play like this, he finally gave birth to the arbitrarily standing there and only dared to stand up and not come over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" The thin man who didn't know when to sneak up and took a knife to hold the neck of Sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't want to move or I will cut the head of this old man." The thin man shouted in a majestic manner and obviously felt that he had taken advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't want to move. When you move the old man's neck, you will open a hole and slammed out. You think about what the scene is. Have you heard the voice of the person whose throat has been cut? It is not good, especially. Come out with your loved ones and friends. Look at the old gentleman. He is so old and bloody, there must be no more." The thin man is hard to describe and strengthen the deterrent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw that this opponent did not move as if it was really pinched and so much more proud. He is very confident about the effect of his usual method. He has always despised those companions who used brute force to fight against their opponents and proud of their high intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as there are people who have relatives, there are friends who have the value of the person who is eager to slash and kill the soft ribs. Can be arrogant and arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled smugly. This is a typical example of his wisdom over those brute force. In this case of defeat, he relied on his wisdom to control the situation. He can already imagine how the master will give him another responsibility after returning, and then he will be the number one under the first trumpeter. He was arrogant and commanded to command the companions who stood there: "You go up and cut a few knives on his hands and feet. Remember to cut off the ribs on the meat so that he can't move anymore but don't hurt. To the important blood vessels, the young master said that he wants to live." He looked at Asa and said, "You can't move, my knife is very fast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two great men stepped forward and slashed their weapons and chopped them down at Asa’s feet. It is the veteran who cuts directly at the position on his heel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams are falling down and they are two big men. Asa did not move and moved very well. He suddenly jumped out and reached the two big men. The two men's weapons were cut on each other and the two men's heads were forced to slam together and slammed on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skin is shocked and angry. It’s decided to tell Wei that the person who ignores his threat. He’s not shouting loudly, but it’s really a slap in the face. The old man’s face was cut. He has encountered such a situation before, but as long as he hands off the nose of the hostage or puts a few knives on his body, the other party will not dare to resist if they see the horror of their friends and relatives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just raised his hand and suddenly he couldn’t move himself. The old white wrinkled hand of the old man just stretched over and touched his body on his other hand as if suddenly it became as stiff as wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man turned around and sighed with a little bit of nostalgia: "I haven’t been slashed by someone for a long time." Looking at the knife in his hand Not holding the ground like this. Then he stretched out his hand and pulled his finger one by one. He changed the knife and changed his grip. He pulled his fingers back one by one to pinch his wrist and cut his knife with his knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every part of the body is normal and clear. The joints are also flexible, but all the muscles are stiff. I watched as the knife cut from my left cheek and went into the muscles. Under the severe pain of the blade, the blood was cut from the incision and then gathered on the skin into a small river running down the chin. He couldn't even move his eyes, only the tears were sorely out of the big eyes and then mixed with the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knife cut out from the thin ear and almost cut off half of his face. His crotch has been soaked, but it is still the gesture of raising his hand and even the remaining half of his face is still that evil expression. Sandru is still saying to him like a child: "You see how good the knife is. You have to take it like this. I forgot that you can't see it. You must do it the next time you take a knife to kill." Sorry, I forgot that you didn’t seem to be next time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few big men over there who have already retired to the door. Sandru said very emotionally to the thin man: "How can your companions ignore you and run away? This is not going to stop you." The pale, dry hand grabbed it effortlessly. Thin body. Under the hand, it seems that it is not skin and muscle but just a pile of mud.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skins immediately have a very strange feeling spread in their own body. . To be precise, this is not a feeling but a feeling of losing feeling. All the feelings in the body centered on that hand are disappearing rapidly. He didn't even have time to think about what it was all about, and he couldn't even feel it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru is just throwing a thin man and the body of a hundred kilograms flies straight out and hits the few people who want to escape and then bursts out like A fart like '噗'. Such a small explosion will not have any lethality, just splashing out the things in the thin body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black paste that blew out of the body flew to the big man who wanted to run. They immediately burst out with the scream of reddish iron juice and rolled down on the ground. But only a few times, it was dumb, and then the skin that was moving there and did not move the whole body showed the gray of the pork that had been put on for several days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stared at the scene in front of him. He knew that Sandron would not need his help early, but he didn't expect it to be such a scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru easily clap his hands. His hand is still so white that the deaths of those few people have not left a trace on him. He seemed to just go to the toilet and drink a glass of water and turned his head and looked at Asa and said, "Do you know that you should have died a few times just now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru’s tone is rare. "I know that killing is not a simple matter. It's much harder than the gimmicks in the pub who haven't touched it. I vomited for the first time after murder and didn't eat anything for three days." He seems to A responsible teacher is as serious as teaching his students. "But if you still don't want to be killed, you have to get used to the feeling of killing. It is obvious that others want your life. Are you still using your knife to cut it? Is it too long? I will ask you if I really just Is there really no resilience? Do you really have scruples?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably," Asa said honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then you wait for someone else to cut your hands and feet and pull away like a dead pig? You didn't threaten what you said others would Treat the person who threatened you?” When Sade was serious, Asa was actually a very majestic and very murderous old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not say anything. These things will be understood as soon as they are thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shandro shook his head as if he wanted to say something and didn’t say it. Just throw a sentence: "You will realize it yourself." Then walk to a lay Next to the big man in the underground. This big man was broken by Asa with a knife back and the collarbone was shrinking into a group there. Sandro bent down and reached out and touched the big man on his face. After a sigh of relief, he stopped the hand, feet and body that had been huddled together. Everyone can see that he has been completely relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru went to another big man on the ground, Asa, and quickly stepped forward to stop him: "They have no resistance anymore"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you remember the boss who loves bragging?" asked Sandru. Asa stunned him and didn't know what it meant to be this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One of his daughters was raped last month. He went to find someone to judge but was cut a knife on his face and is still lying dead at home. "Shandro's hand on his face was exactly the same as the position where he cut the thin man and pointed to the black pulp water that opened the big beach." There are still some pieces of bone that are being melted, and it is completely invisible that this beach thing was once a person. "That's what he did. These guys seem to be slaves raised in a high-ranking government. I tell you that each of them often does this kind of thing. There are few people on the street who don't know them and are afraid of them. You think they are pitiful." Or are those who are being bullied by them pitiful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa silently looked at Sandro and went forward to touch the big man who was lying down in the ground. . These sturdy big men, under the hands of this old man, seem to be dying with almost no ants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru came back and said in the tone of the lesson: "I will tell you even if they are all damned, I will do the same."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If they let them go, they will go back and tell their masters and there will be more people coming to even the priests of the Wangdu Guards Church. Do I have to Are they all killed? And if there is a person in the Magic Academy who will use the Necromancer Black Magic and the Bishop is still in contact with this person, what kind of trouble will it be? What do you say?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asam silently nodded. Q: "So how do you deal with this now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it now? What is it like now? I don’t know what I have been doing this evening. In the discussion with the bishop, the bishop can give me testimony. I don't know how these people died here and broke my things. I don't know who to pay for it."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stunned and nodded. He is speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
