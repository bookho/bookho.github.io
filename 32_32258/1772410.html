			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s much earlier than I expected. It’s a man who can afford it.” The Pope saw Asa’s departure. A look at the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The biggest advantage of this person is that knowing who he is is the second is enough. Even a person who is supposed to kill is not an annoying person." Sloan nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just that my time is running out." The pope nodded. He seemed to finally sigh and sighed and coughed twice. The next two red bloods slowly flowed out of his nose. He took a deep breath and re-sucked the two blood streams back to raise his hand and wipe the pale face to leave a faint scarlet. However, it seems that even he did not notice that his ear hole also slowly leached blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, we don't have much time." Lancelot saw that he was not surprised. It was an indescribable weight. I am going out to the Principality of Clos tonight..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not our time, my time is running out. The Pope shook his head. "You don't care." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot did not speak but his face was getting heavier.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not stay In the School of Magic, I quietly went to the king.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although people are idle, his heart is still not busy. There may be ten days or so. I’m dying to see everyone busy and nervous, but the core is actually him. No matter who is in this situation, no one can stand still. As long as he is completely quiet and free, he feels inexplicably and feels a sense of anxiety and rises like a fire. And all the feelings are grilled and hot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has visited all the places he used to live in Wangdu, no matter where he often goes. The pub is still a former flat in the flats of the land. But it is not as good as he hopes that it can not alleviate this anxiety, but it is more disturbing to feel more upset with the fire.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things themselves are sometimes not the most unbearable. The most unbearable thing is Waiting, not to mention the fact that he is waiting for death. And this is not a complete death. There seems to be a slight faintness in the death. For example, a little light in the dark abyss can not kill, but only in the horror of death. The land is devastated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already dark. He’s already unknowingly walked to the Duke’s house. Because of the extraordinary period of time. In the past, the traffic jams have disappeared. Only a few pedestrians have faintly passed through the lights in the ducal palace.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hidden in the shadows of the street I looked at the familiar house on the opposite side. Almost everything started from there, and there were too many things happening there. He once thought that he would never come here again from now on because of the birth there. Everything is so heavy that he is somewhat reluctant to think back. But he can't help but have the urge to walk in.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to go doing what? "After the distance, someone asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Want to find a woman. "Asa did not answer back. He noticed that someone followed him. He also knew who the person who followed him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why would you think? Going to find a woman? "Don't pause this person to ask in a very strange voice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I don't believe you can still look around when I go to bed with a woman." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you such a person actually...can actually be...can be..." The man came out from behind the corner. Although it was a Ordinary wearing but not losing the height of a man and a gold look still very conspicuous.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I knew that she was following behind but saw Talis At the time, Asa was slightly surprised. The reason was that he was only because she was not wearing the old knight or the samurai dress but the ordinary women's clothing. Just wearing it on her body and then ordinary clothes. It also looks great.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough, it’s much better to be a woman. You don't have to wear a knight to wear a chest. "Asa smiles." Seeing your walking posture is not the first time you wear a skirt in your life. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Asa thought about it. Just boring and going shopping together. "Asa walked over and pulled out Talis's arm and left. Talis earned a break and couldn't break away and walked away a few steps and finally violently threw away Asa. But it was light and Asa." I walked together.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people on the long street have been lightly faintly bright and prosperous, the night view of Wangdu is now only a glimpse of the street lights Illuminate the road alone on the street.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If at any other time, Asa will not dream of going shopping with a woman even if she is dreaming. It is said that this woman is still with him. But now it is also somewhat different from other times.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you find me something? "Talis has never been open to ask Asa first.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis is silent and asks: "I heard that." Why don't you run away? You could have escaped when you were in the whispering forest. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very simple because I don't want to escape." "Asa looks at Talis." What do you mean by asking this question? You don't seem to want me to run away. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not. "Talis immediately replied very loudly and slyly, and her expression was very strange. It seemed to be doubts and indignation. "Why are people like you who are despicable and dark inside make such a great decision?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great? "Asa laughs. "I don't think so. Do you think? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the dark streetlight, Asa still saw that Talis’s face was red. She said loudly like a defense: "You could have been yourself." I fled alone to the Far East but chose to stay and die. Do you think that you are a hero and you are great? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to you?" "Asa looked at her and asked. He could see that her mood was very wrong.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if I really don't know. Suddenly, the voice of Talis began to choke. "I really don't know what is wrong with what." Who is the right person who is wrong..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a surprise to Asa. From just knowing her, the Knights of the Knights single-handedly sneak into the thief The nest has been smothered by flesh and blood, and she has always been more sloppy than a man. Even if it is not for some reason, he almost treated her as a man.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the fall of the Glorious Castle. In fact, Lancelot is letting me follow you. He...he...said let me and you...and you...if there is a chance..." Talis’s blush was at its peak. But at least half of it was the reason for indignation. "He said that you are mostly not Will run away. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really a good idea. "Asa smiled. Although Talis did not say it, but what does it mean, Asa also asked Chu.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Talis almost jumped up. "I will never do it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Don't worry, you don't have to do it. "Asa answered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis suddenly stood watching him. There was tears in his eyes. "How do you... then when you were in Nigan?" How is it again..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the time I was a little out of control, I am really sorry for you. "Asa looked at Talis and said very seriously. "I'm sorry. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can a teacher let me do this kind of thing?" What is the only evil genius of the most sinister politicians to do? When I became a knight of the shrine, I swear that my body and my life were all dedicated to the teacher of God. But he and your sister Ai Meimei were half because you were half because of the teacher and your plan. His Majesty also ordered Tamik to go to the whispering Sen to kill the elves. But in the end, the elves now have an alliance with the Majesty. What is going on? Can you be a good person with your teacher and your teacher? And the bad guys like you. In the end, it can be a great role as a salvation. Are you a good person or a bad person? Who will tell me whether I have been doing right or wrong all the time? I used to believe that things are all in the end, nothing is nothing? "Talis has already had a lot of screams and tears have already flowed all over her face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa secretly sighed. The original women usually show strength is nothing but Because the heart has dependence and faith. Faith can make people strong and even suppress the spirit of any emotion to support people. But once they collapse, they are weak. Nothing is lost. When they escaped from the Glorious Castle, they saw Talis face. The response to Ai Mei, who was converted to the corpse, has already been understood.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
