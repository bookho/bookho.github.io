			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 10,000-strong army of Judah, including the most elite thousands of heavy-duty knights in the coalition, was actually smashed by a group of Oufu troops under one face. This news against the coalition's morale strikes almost all the forces of the rear coalition forces immediately stopped moving forward. The battle that had taken the absolute upper hand became a unilateral slaughter. Only a few people who fell to the end can escape to the coalition forces. The news that the troops took back was even greater than the blow of the battle itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers are still immersed in incredible panic. They just know the fiasco and the generals on the battle have been stunned by the specific process of the battle. Even the soldiers who fled back were strictly forbidden to mention. All the generals of the coalition immediately gathered to convene a military conference and also invited three of the coalition's three divisions and five great priests to participate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is all the reloaded knights destroyed with just one magic?" * The expressions of the division and the priests are like listening to fairy tales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the people who included the three heads of the reloaded Knights in the scope of the magic were spared a total loss of about 6,000 people and then The troops of Oufu took the opportunity to take the opportunity to charge the remaining troops. The morale of the remaining troops had already collapsed and even escaped and escaped dozens of people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The three regiments of Judah Even if you have a long battle, you will be a little better than the Knights of the Temple, but it will be much stronger than the ordinary Templar. The three may even be able to compete with Lancelot. Their top fighters can never be casually Magic can be defeated, so I would like to ask the three * divisions is this legendary..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage and priests looked at each other * The teacher nodded his head and said with a dry voice: "It is the magic of the curse-level spell. The ability to cover such a large range of 6,000 people can only be the magic of the curse-level."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...Sedros can never use a curse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&n Bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if it can be used. He will not use it. He is the leader of Oufudi after all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But but in addition to him Who else can use such advanced magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe...he used other means..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A general interrupted the Masters: Can you tell us the details of the three masters? What exactly is going on? If the soldiers know that the orcs have mastered the magic of the curse, then the morale is not what we can control. And... If Oufu really has this power, then everything must be reconsidered... maybe we have to retreat. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the curse of this extreme ultimate destructive force, there are no more distinctions between the soldiers who are more elite and the more powerful soldiers. The concept of warfare is The change of this kind of power is the essence of the soldiers who died in a fierce battle, and it is another thing to sacrifice it in a meaningless way like an ant under fire.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests immediately shook their heads and said, "Impossible." It is impossible for Oufu to master this kind of magic. Any curse must be the ability to cultivate more than two lines of magic to the top level and then resonate with each other to be able to produce magical power. Throughout the Big Six, you can practice both magical skills to the top magician, even if you include the Pope and the Necromancer of the Deva Valley, there will never be more than ten people. And there will be no Cedros in these ten people. Although he is also a top great magician, he is only longer than the magical spellcasting technique and the magic of the middle and high level of all the departments. He does not practice any magic to the highest level, so he can't use the curse anyway. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most critical factor in restricting the curse is that the magical vibration generated by the curse when used is also unbearable for the human body, even if it is more sophisticated. It is also unimaginable for the caster to control the load of the two lines of magic at the same time, even if it is not dead after successful casting. Magical ability will also drop dramatically unless the legendary monsters such as dragons or lichs are likely to release the curse and not damage themselves. So the magician who can use the curse is not without the magician who can sacrifice his magic and use the curse. Therefore, no one has used the record of the curse for six or more decades. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals nodded but were even more confused. One general asked: "But how do you explain this situation?" This kind of magic that the teacher should have used in desperate circumstances was in the first contact with the orcs. This is really unreasonable... or is there a scroll of cursed magic? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oufu should have established a magical array of transmissions. It shows that they have eyes of the stars and they are indeed close to the Sandefies...do they..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "But even if it is made of this material, it is a real problem. The creator's own magical power must be able to cast this curse. The level of several magicians must also be above the same level. Today Big 6 In addition to the Glorious Castle... The Tower of the Tooth may be... and there is... Deva Valley.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Fia Valley?” All the priests And the Masters reflexively took a breath of cold and immediately asked the priest: "What is that magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soldier who fled back The simple report of the report is repeated. Although the soldiers who fell to the end of the army did not see the situation at the time, these descriptions were enough to distinguish the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three mages at the same time looked ugly and nodded and said: "It’s not the destruction of the elemental system. It really isn’t the Master of the Tower of the Tooth..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is silent about this inference and slowly pushes the possibility of the problem to a greater and more serious level. If Oufu is behind the big 6 most mysterious and most horrible magician organization. Then everything must be re-estimated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No general here is the kind of person who will be intimidated by the zombie dead spirit magic. The generals on the battlefield will only consider what kind of combat power the enemy has. But because of this, they will be more scrupulous. The most terrifying horror is the unknown horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half-sounding, a general said slowly: "In the end, what is behind us, no matter what the horrible power of the curse, Oufu is fighting." It was used from the beginning. There are only two possibilities. One is that they are not only able to use this one or they may have a more horrible trump card so they don't need to put this curse reel in the end as a trump card. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great priest said with a scorpion: "No one wants this possibility. The second?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second is that they can only use this one time. This is used at the outset to confuse us. Let us be scrupulous. This is purely a psychological threat tactic."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A curse scroll that could have reversed the situation was only used to confuse us early? Although it is hoped that this is the case, but this possibility is not great..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sink again The latter general said, "What should we do? Now the troops of Erasia have been delayed by Tatalia. If we wait for the grain to be replenished, the 20,000 cavalry in the rear can be dispatched, but even then we There are only 50,000 troops in total and the morale is extremely low. As long as Oufu does have a trump card that is more powerful than the curse, our chances are not great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A large priest took out the delivery scroll and sighed and said: "Then I will not move until the army of Elecia has returned to the division before returning to the division. I will report to His Majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only hope that Elazia will be able to expel the barbarians from the country as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important town northeast of Elazia Wyster got it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wester is not only the gateway to the kingdom of Elazia. It is also a big city integrating business and manufacturing. All year round, it is full of excitement and vitality. Nowadays, the city that is so lively and incomparable is now more exciting. But now it’s no longer the hustle and bustle of the bustling, but the screams of the barbarians who screamed at the sword and the shield. Blood corpses are everywhere. Everybody in the broken limbs jumps and squirms and squirms all the way to slash the weapons in their hands into the body in front of them in exchange for as many screams and flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large buildings. The archers are desperately screaming at the savage savage guards who are swarming into the street. The swordsmen stand in a row and fight against the waves and the pikemen. They are assassinated by long weapons in their hands. There is hardly any effective fortification in the heart of Erasia, and the barbarian's marching can only be described as a broken bamboo. The news of the defeat in front was almost in sync with the attack of the barbarians. The troops of Elazia were forced to start street fighting without saying that they were effectively armed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the priests are chanting prayers to the swordsmen and throwing auxiliary spells to heal the wounds, the swordsmen's fronts are gradually retreating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Warriors of the Wild Land of the North have always relied on this courage and fierceness against the swords and armor of the Erasian swordsmen but they are now Not only do you have these, but every barbarian wears a vine. I don’t know what kind of vine-weaving armor is the defensive power of the iron-woven woven chain, and it doesn’t look heavy when it covers the whole body. It’s hard for the swordsmen’s swords or arrows to make a complete blow to the barbarian. The injury and the barbarian's hands are no longer the kind of inferior goods of even rough and even the meteorite axe. The steel tomahawk is now in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Hang' a fireball shot from the window of an attic. In the barbarian crowd, two or three barbarians screamed and were blown up. Several barbarians around the broken body were also shaken, but these were shaken down and then stood up again. The vines on their bodies were even quite resistant to flames and magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is already the last magician in the Eliasian army and this fireball is also his last shot. Several barbarians screamed and climbed into the attic. Window. The hard-working rushed away the guardian soldiers around the magician to split the magician into several segments. These savage warriors, who were originally afraid of magic, are no longer afraid of the tricks of these fireballs and ice bombs. The victory has completely helped them overcome this psychological obstacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the mobilization reinforcements? The guys of the Knights of the Kingdom don’t come? After they fall, they can go straight to the king." The officer looked at it. Near the collapse of the line, the mad screaming at the scouts who came back alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Knights of the Kingdom must protect the safety of Her Majesty the Queen and cannot leave the city. But it is said that the troops stationed on the edge of Niegen in the west have already transferred 10,000 fires. Here is coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Negan border? When they came to the beast, they had leveled the king." The officer was already hysterical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s here that there are dozens of huge figures in the sky, lightning and fireballs have been thrown down and the brutal attacks have been messed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s the Griffin Knights, our reinforcements are coming." The soldiers began to scream and the morale that was about to collapse was suddenly alive. The western border is too far from here. The large forces of the reinforcements are hard to reach, but these high-pitched gryphon knights seem to be coming in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leg of the Erasian forces has finally stabilized, but the role that these gryphon knights can play is not likely to reverse the battle. The two griffin knights began to sneak into the barbarians but immediately became the target of dozens of axe. The gryphon and the knight were chopped almost in midair. So all the griffins are no longer flying. Only the magic bombing of the above-mentioned ten battle mage at high altitude is destructive to the barbarians below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this kind of attack that can’t be counterattack does indeed cause a lot of damage to the barbarian. The greater impact is morale. For a time, the barbarians angrily screamed and deafened. From time to time, an axe hurledly cast a high-altitude arc into the sky and fell again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer who just breathed a sigh of relief suddenly stunned. His attention was all on the battlefield until now, when he feels relaxed, it seems that a faint thunder is slow. It becomes clear from slow to inaudible. But now it’s sunny, noon, and the sun is glaring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer looked up in the direction of the thunder and saw that a black cloud was slowly approaching here. The faint thunder came from here. At this time, many people on the battlefield have begun to notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer's face that saw this black cloud has become darker than the clouds. He made a louder voice than the screaming savage barbarian: "Yes Dragonfly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being close to seeing this black cloud actually moves very fast and it is not a cloud at all. It is the scene of the gathering of tens of thousands of dragons. The same gryphon knights in the sky immediately greeted the sea of ​​insects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Griffin Knights turned and began to run away, but this huge bird carrying a person is clearly unlikely to outperform these light insects. A dozen battle mage violently bombarded the dragonfly group with a fireball. Each fireball allowed dozens of hundreds of dragons to burn and fall to a fire wall to burn a thousand. But they only have time to get two or three magics. The black clouds of the group completely wrapped them up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
