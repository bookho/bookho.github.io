			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the cave still exudes the heat generated by the magical array of the Tema Grand Priest, and the massive fall of the rock presents a quirky pothole shape, until now there are still sporadic The rock is falling down. There is a small hole in a huge pothole, and the gas element carries the two people flying up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is the Shura hell of the sea of ​​murders. From this hole, it is completely another world. The dark glory radiated from the surrounding bryophytes, and a river flowed from a distance. At the entrance of the cave, a young girl magician was looking down and looking down, and he was relieved to see the gas element coming safely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talisi riding, is this girl your friend?" Sylvia naturally sees that the storm magic was manned, Talis It doesn't mean water magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Meimei saw that Sylvia couldn’t help but shrink back, although the white magic light on the shining armor seemed to be a peaceful and holy place. But she is now subconsciously feared and disgusted with the people of Celeste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sylvia is not in the middle, he is still immersed in the big ups and downs, feeling: "It is really thanks to you two, otherwise this task I will It’s a failure. It doesn’t matter if I die by myself. It’s unforgivable for the Pope’s plan to be lost. Now I only hope that the Lancero Katelin magician can go well...”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The teacher also came to Nigan?" Talis stunned. "Where is he now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the screams of the moment, they may have killed Moriel."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis and Ayimei couldn’t help but look at the direction of the scream that was just the direction that Asa went. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hard-to-find dragon scales are flying and the blood is flashing. I used to wear a deep slogan of Niegen and screamed from the dragon's mouth. The Holy Light Cross Sword slanted from her right shoulder, and cut off the shoulder blade and a rib. She almost slashed into the lungs. The blood of this giant beast rushed out like a fountain spring. This injury is not just that it looks like a simple cut, the vindictiveness and magic of the Holy Cross sword have completely penetrated into the dragon's body. The actual damage is at least twice the appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot in midair did not relax at all, but instead tightened. Such a blow can be almost fatal, but it is only almost, not really fatal. Moriel reluctantly moved the huge body in the midst of the millennium, and the hair of the cross that could have put her head down was just on her shoulder. If the fatal injury is not really fatal, it can only be hurt. And this is the strongest creature on the mainland. No matter how many injuries, as long as she has not died, it is possible to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams did not dissipate in the resurgence. In addition to the pain, Morrie's pair of dragon eyes is more maddening. Her huge dragon mouth is still big, but it is not a scream, but a dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red-yellow flames are rolling out of the dragon's mouth, and the first thing to do is Lancelot. The sacred cross sword had just exhausted all his vindictiveness and strength, and he couldn’t dodge in the air. In the blink of an eye, his figure was drowned in the raging fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the boom, this fire is like a flood of tens of thousands of years of rushing and rushing, unable to clean up, drowning Lancelot and after There is no slight stop to hinder, and the moment is filled with the entire cave. Bring all the other Taurens together with the Temple Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams of the tauren’s heartbreaking screams did not last long. This is like a lava-like dragon and the bones can be burnt to ashes, and the remaining bulls heads The man and the priest were silent and screamed and silenced under the flood of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, the flame in the dragon's mouth was dissipated. She gave a powerless embarrassment, and the huge body fell softly to the ground. The bitterness of this anger was beyond her true limit, which was originally used when the physical strength was intact. Under such a serious injury, she almost spit out her own dragon and lungs together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red-yellow flame gradually dissipated, the Taurens have all disappeared, and the blue ball shields are displayed in the five temple knights, including Lancelot Within them, they launched the sacred shield on the glorious armor in the midst of the millennium, and they were able to withstand the stagnation of this fuss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of Nigan, the strongest and most mysterious creature on the mainland, is no better than a chicken, and it doesn't even have to be taken care of. It can't be much longer with her injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot gave a long breath. The glory of his armor has some traces of burning, just the time to open the sacred guardian shield, but the magical defense of this brilliance armor is weaker, and he is at the forefront of the dragon’s interest. Come down. Even his heart is determined, as he now has some unreal feelings about this immediate victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after all, I finally won. When Moriel died, the church’s biggest scruples against Nigan were no longer there, and Sylvia’s good side, if it’s going well, can be said to have been devastated, and Elazia and the rest of the country have no worries. And the skins of Moriel's body will be the equipment of the Celeste warriors through the hands of skilled craftsmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that as a powerful creature from the remnants of the Elder Age, plus the legendary dragon is a habit of collecting treasures, there is no reason in this dragon. Will not collect two precious magic items. From a certain perspective, this is one of the biggest reasons for the post-teaching interest in slaughtering Kurosan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this huge victory is waiting for him to harvest, but Lancelot is faintly feeling a little wrong. Because the victory came and relaxed some of the spirit of the concentration, he will definitely find out what is wrong. He suddenly looked back at the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other four Knights of the Temple also suddenly looked back at the hole. After the dragons that had just swept through all the space in the cave, there was still a tauren's breathing sound in their breathing, just behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the cave, the shape of a Tauren priest is surrounded by two elements of fire. It is these two giant elements that are immune to the flames that help him withstand the stagnation of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest's robes on this tauren priest are somewhat different from other priests, and it seems that this should be the leader. It was only on this road that he did not open his mouth. From the beginning of the battle, he also placed the magic man behind the other Tauren priests, which seemed to be no different from other priests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he has always been in the position that is the farthest and farthest away from Moriel, and even left the cave standing in the passage outside the hole, otherwise the sky It is also impossible for dragons to withstand only two elements of fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magician who can summon two elemental giants should indeed be somewhat different from other priests. But the most different thing is that he actually showed his power difference at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Knights of the Temple and Lancelot are about to react, this unique Tauren priest has two more reels at this time. , facing the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surging magical power flashed, and the scroll was turned into ashes in the hands of the Tauren priest. It seems that nothing is being sent from the reel, at least it seems so. But as the reel unfolds, the four Shrine Knights and Lancelot have already begun to leap here, and the running figure is a meal. The two knights of the Shrine did not stand still, and almost fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mollier, who could have supported his body slightly, was completely soft like a pile of mud. Her huge body pressed the rocks underneath and began to collapse. And the entire cave began to tremble slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gravity field?" Lancelot watched incredulously as the Tauren priest struggled to spit out the word. He now feels that breathing is not air, but is a mass of rocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the single system of the earth system, although it is not as powerful as the stars of the gas, but it is already higher than the fire. The last grade. Within this magic court, the gravity will be ten times higher than usual. If the ordinary person with weak constitution is in the scope of this earthworm's ultimate mantra, even the body will be sucked up by its own weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple are not ordinary people, but it is impossible to easily face the ultimate spell of this system. And they haven't even reacted in this magic that has been gathered, and the Tauren priest has pulled out a reel to unfold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scroll just dissipated with a blue glow, and it seems that nothing happened. But Lancelot recognized the blue light, which is the unique brilliance of the space magician. His face is more surprised than when he first noticed the gravity field. It is even more ugly: "Space lock?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
