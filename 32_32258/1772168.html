			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Axis carefully took out a small pale blue wafer from her arms. This is the thing that the employer gave them when they first entrusted them. They can be notified when there is any situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing has not been used except that there is really nothing big to do, mainly because Aisisi almost immediately lost control and then reported to Hilika. Out of the approximate price of this thing. So Hilika also decided not to use it anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ‘everyday’ usually has a limit, as it is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axis looked at the small piece of water sigh and sighed to send his son to the heart of the sacrifice, saying: "If this thing has If you sell it to Celeste or the tower of the tooth in the east, it will be worth at least two thousand gold coins. This is just selling it as magic material. This is the fragment of the star..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Star Stone is the most magical, rarest and most precious of all magical materials. Just like the magic jade, it is only produced in the Sandefés. But unlike the magic jade, which is known as the "source of magic," it cannot resonate with the magic of any department and cannot store magic. Its only function is to create magical fluctuations that break out of the space by magical fluctuations that cannot be produced in any other way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stone of the Stars has been unable to be evaluated in the age of the present. It only knows that it is about the same as the magical culture. The magical magical fluctuations have attracted countless magicians to bet on life-long diamonds, but even after a few years of ignorance, the magician’s research has never been a space magician. There was once a great magician who said with emotion that countless geniuses spent enough energy and time on the Stone of Stars to push the magic culture forward for two hundred years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the efforts of these geniuses are not entirely in vain. Although it is impossible to analyze the nature of this magical fluctuation, like other magical techniques, it can transform all kinds of ever-changing spells that can be used flexibly. However, they have also explored the practicality of transmitting magic magic scrolls in the practice of countless failures, although it is known. I don’t know what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All space magic must rely on the stone of the stars to move. The most complete star stone is called the 'eye of the star', which is rare in the world. For the past few hundred years, there have been only ten transmission magic arrays on the entire Big Six. The main reason is the lack of a complete star eye. The fragment of the eye of the star is the fragment of the star. It can also create a temporary magic array that can only be used once. From the practical point of view, it is also precious. Even the dust of the smallest star is also the raw material for the production of the reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the complete Star of the Eyes, the use of the pieces will be scrapped once, of course, the piece of Aisisi is no exception. However, this piece is very different from the usual one. The finer lines above the headline make up a magical array in this palm-sized Mercury piece. Just this near-artistic approach is enough to show how valuable this thing is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't hurry and hurry." Hilica said in a hurry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Xi The secretary nodded and screamed and injected the magic power into the wafer. The magical light of blue began to light up on his hands. This is a very special light that transmits magic. It is a lot smaller and purer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This direct use of the Star's Fragments, even if it's a subtle magical array, can't use transfer magic but can produce similar effects. This magical light did not flash like a delivery reel and condensed in his hand. Soon after, a figure appeared vaguely in the light. An old but energetic voice came out: "What happened to the mercenaries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes Such a respect. Dear Boss." Ai Sisi's expression and voice are very solemn and pious. It was used when he prayed to God at the School of Magic many years ago. "We gave birth to a small accident and there was a person who would probably be very interested..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long. In a hidden place not far from the thieves test site, the little Sandefis man also took out a fragment of the same star. Infused into the magical blue light also shows a figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The plan has changed a halfway and took out a shrine knight." The man said to the image of the magical light. "I decided to change the plan temporarily. I plan..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." The image sighed and interrupted the man. "The guys have already told me that I probably guess what you want to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They saw your identity. Tell me this fake Necromancer. Please come and catch you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think these guys' heads are not bad. I thought I could hold them for a while." The man’s smile was still a smile that was not smiling. "What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I naturally told them to spread it. Let them take advantage of your work in Tula, I naturally I will come to pick you up. I promised them enough to make them willing to do anything." The laughter from the shadow is so happy that it seems to have a younger taste. "It is no problem that the promise of the short is too big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just hope that your acting can pass." The man smiled. Say. "You said you guessed my plan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to bring the church together into Tulale?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking to half of my goal is not that the church is the Necromancer. I have already tried to tell the Temple Knight that I will go to Tula, what I am still planning. She did not leave the traces and did not come up with a helper. It saved me a lot of time. As long as the knight went back to report..." The man smiled. Probably in Celeste, people who knew that the Necromancers should understand my identity first, they will come directly to Tula Leone, so that the Descartes will notice the leaves of the world tree in Tula. We will not ask the elves to ask for your help. By the time, Ou Fuda can ask for the price. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... to tell the truth, these thieves can not give enough pressure to the elves, and I have no confidence. I have also been thinking about pulling the attention of the Necromancer. I can't think of people but do it first. "The image is five-syllable or worried." But you are so risky and have too many uncertainties. The reason I haven't been doing this is that I can't grasp the movements of Descartes and Celeste and can't really know ourselves. What if they react outside of your expectations? Are you sure that Deya Valley will be more handsy than the church? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man smiled a little. He said, "You can rest assured." I reported the name of Sander. The church pastor bishops may not understand what it means. The Necromancer must know that this is me. Those guys would never want me to fall into the church first, so they must be more hands-on than the church people and I believe they have a way to prevent the church from intervening. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it's still too risky..." The people in the light and shadow then said one word at a time. "Never look down on them and they are not qualified to look down." they. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I never dared to look down on those guys. But I know they will do that. I can't turn a blind eye to the bait of the world tree leaf. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know this but I am still not at ease. "The people in the light and shadow are hesitating. They are silent. "After all, they can't have the slightest effect..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who can really put everything into change?" Mastered? The man shook his head and sighed a little. "It’s inevitable that risk is inevitable. After all, we don’t have a lot of money left. If we can transfer the attention of the church and the Necromancer in this place, the situation is very advantageous. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Time is running out, maybe only take the risk. "The voice in the light and shadow also sighed. "You inform us at the right time that I and Gru will come at the first time. The strength of the three of us should be able to cope with several Necromancers. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is good to be able to kill a few by the way." Ha ha. The man smiled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't think too well to be able to successfully complete the goal. Thank you very much." "The voice in the light and shadow sighed. "I just received the news. It seems that the church is also preparing to send people to the Einfast Empire. It seems to be prepared to adopt a fully hostile attitude towards Oufu. Probably still want to add the power of the power after Ronis died. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Einfast Empire? The man frowned. He said: "There should be no problem. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although there is a peace treaty there, I am still not at ease." If the Necromancers really want to manipulate a paper and a contract, it will have no effect. Now I only hope that the guys in the Descartes are good enough to get your message in the fastest way. And put your attention here. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
