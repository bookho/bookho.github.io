			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance is calculated very accurately. As the two beasts began to vomit, Asa saw the team waiting in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that during this time, Oufu dispatched reinforcements. More than a dozen werewolves and ogres, more than a dozen large-scale guns under the command of Luken made a battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunderbirds are generally reluctant to fly out of the mountains. Only a dozen or so large eagle eagerly chased them but only lost a few bodies under the power of huge smashing arrows. I ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who received the news and the things the orcs left as soon as possible. There are only four left in the Kodo beast. Only two of them have been tired and half dead. So the hard guns brought by those hardships have only thrown a large part of them. After all, it is good to leave the range of the Sandefes Range as soon as possible or leave as soon as possible. The Kodo beast carries the ore and Bimen's nails and the ogre trotting alongside. For their physical strength different from humans, it is not a problem to leave the mountains of Sandefes. With the help of honey water and food, Asa's physical strength has quickly recovered and now she is basically able to move freely. But after all, I can't run like a werewolf, so he is the only one sitting on the Kodo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luken commanded the team to jump on the Kodo beast and sit next to Asa. The hair in most parts of his body has been lost because of charring. It looks strange to be like a mixture of dogs and people who have lost their hair. He whispered, "I'm sorry. I decided to throw you there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the difference." Asa smiled lightly. "You don't even take the ore. It means that it is a last resort to put me down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, everyone else opposed it. I repeatedly said that your injury has been I am not allowed to bump and guarantee to them that they will be able to save you. This is agreed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nodded and said: "I believe that your decision must have Your reason. And as far as I am concerned, I also think that this choice is correct. The two newborns will be very happy to see Bissendros."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "If you can successfully train it, it will be the unrivalled combat power of Oufu." Luken's small eyes have amazing brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa also nodded slightly. During this time, he has a full understanding of this powerful ability. And Oufu’s experience with armed orcs and beasts is unmatched by other countries. An ogres put on a special heavy armor and take up a weapon. The combat power is ten times that of bare hands. It is thus imaginable how the two armed Bimeng will be on the battlefield. And for this precious fighting power, Cedrus will not be able to add material to them with two magical resistance armor. Two such monsters can almost flatten a small army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ore is not afraid of being lost and you may be able to support it for a while. But the two newly born Bimeng will not work if they stay a few The sky will die, so we can only take them out with them as soon as possible and feed them with honey* juice and chewed meat and send them to Oufu as soon as possible. So you only have to wait for a few days with the ore. The breath of the two behemoths in the cave is still not close to other beasts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said I don't care. Don't explain to me. Your choice is correct." Asa looked at the hairless werewolf and smiled. "It's actually that you can judge in those situations that it is not easy to find the nest before the two children have just born a baby."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "In fact, there is nothing. After all, it is strange that two Simmons appear at the same time. Many solitary animals only stay together when mating and producing. And the second one appears so suddenly and naturally that the nest is Not far away." Luken took a long breath and revealed his teeth. "And when I first saw a monster like Bimeng, I was thinking if it could be domesticated like a Wyvern to help Oufu..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "At any time, from the perspective of Oufu, it seems that Cedrus really did not misread you." Asa nodded. Sedros specifically mentioned this werewolf when he handed the team to him. Although it is only a mention, but worthy of Sedrosti will never be brute force and bravery but wisdom and judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because that is our city." Luken faintly answered a bitter smile. "Because the relationship between the two little Bimeng has to be abandoned by us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There were no corpses found." Luken’s wolf face and voice whispered through the strange sadness. "He is too heavy. We can't put him in the same way as you did before the wind. You can only find a gap in the cliff and hide it. I only hope that his luck will be better. But this time, Alkin takes people back. I didn’t see anything at the time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asam. Hard to bring him to Taniguchi but did not really bring him out. He hesitated to ask: "Is there any opinion to give up hisville for the two little Bimen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clorin and Vail are entering Sandefes The best of the four ogres in the mountains is to fight together to the last two. The feelings of orcs among races are usually much stronger than humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. The situation is forced. He also knows that Clolon’s role in Oufu will never be the same."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed. Only then can he realize the true meaning of the ‘our city’ in Luken’s mouth. He said: "You just said that they did not agree to leave me. Do they think that my role will be greater than a Bimeng?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are A friend of the city of Cedros. He will never let you die if he let you lead us." Luken faintly replied with a weird smile. "But as far as I am concerned, I still feel that you are not as important as you are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the identity of Asa is really important, so Delos did not explain to the orcs that the person who would lead them to death would explain all the reasons by using only one 'friend'. But this explanation is enough in the eyes of these orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed again. He didn't know whether he should be grateful or emotional about these orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luken stared at Asa’s pair of wolf eyes but shimmered with the light that humans had. He seems to be a little hesitant and whispered to Asa: "Can I ask a question?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nod. "What problem do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luken carefully looked at Asana’s face, which was hidden in the crowd and slowly asked "Why are you always wearing a mask?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa licked the pair of eyes that looked ordinary and unremarkable. Closed inside. The expression on his face was a very sweet smile. "How do you know that I have a mask?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Asa can’t see it, he can be sure that this expression must be perfect, a little bit hostile and not right. Will let the werewolf see it. This is a magic mask made by Sandru. This can be seen by how talented people who must use Necromancer can use this flexibly. According to Sandro's understanding of the human body, any facial muscle changes can be seamlessly displayed on this mask. The skin and muscles treated by Necromancer are not only breathable, but can even sweat and automatically match the color of the surrounding skin. Asa saw that Sandro put on such a mask, at least he could not see any clues anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being touched by the most sensitive topic in this heart, Asa has a point of caution and alertness. Fortunately, the clumsy footsteps of Kodo and Luke’s very low voice, Altun and other werewolves who were concentrating on trot, didn’t turn around and seemed to be unable to hear their conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luken said: "Because the smell on your body is always a little lighter on the face. It feels like a person with a blindfolded face. When you are weak and faint, I notice a slight scent of magical dissonance on your face. So I think you should wear a magic mask that is very strange."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa didn't answer but looked at Luken and suddenly said: "I remember you used the magic scroll that I dropped."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Luken nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magic scroll is not available to anyone. A magician or a low-level apprentice must also have at least a little magician skills." Sa’s vision has also fallen on the face of the werewolf. "I never thought that an orc could actually use a magic scroll."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luken did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the scroll of the fiery bomb is the most dangerous of all the magic scrolls. I heard that there have been precedents for the magician to roast the whole person but you use It’s not just luck to burn your whole body hair. It’s not a big deal to make such a high-end scroll, so it’s not likely to have inferior power.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
