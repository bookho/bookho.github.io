			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The midday sun shines brightly on the high ground, and the large piece of ground on the hill is shining. The ground on the top of the mountain is deliberately flattened and the flowering seems to be not natural. The mountain shape has disappeared, but the artificial deliberately made a large platform. The platform is also arranged very well for the sake of smoothness to ensure that the magic array above can best achieve the desired effect. Because this is not one or two magical arrays on the ground, but there are dozens or even hundreds of various magical arrays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the platform where this magical array is gathered, a white man with a white must-have looks at the green leaves and looks at it and then sighs helplessly. It was disappointment and regrettably, this magical thing shining with green light drifted down in the air and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man sat down on the ground. These days, he only slept for two or three hours a day. All the other time spent on this little leaf, but the result was still nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is already the most intelligent and knowledgeable person on the Big 6, the most abundant and capable person. He can rescue several endangered sub-humans from the human hoof. Races can call on them to build a city in a barren land. But now facing this little leaf, he only feels his powerlessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros sighed and glanced at the magical array around the ground. The original energetic eyes are now full of blood and tiredness. He has tried all the methods and still can't figure out the magic contained in the leaves that are purely condensed by vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because that is the god? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God. Cedros never believed in this thing. Because he is not only smart and knowledgeable, but also a strong self-confidence and self-awareness. Every improvement in his every achievement is given by his own sweat and hard work in exchange for something that is not necessary. He has always believed that the world can be held in his hands by his own hands. But now this little leaf makes him see a real mystery that is far away. A feeling of emptiness makes him feel very annoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few soft voices, General Gru jumped from the edge of the platform behind Cedrus. The hill is tall and steep but he is as easy as walking up a step. General Gru’s hand also carried a person who lost the person as soon as he got on the platform. This is a very short person who is only half the height of General Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Gru looked at the magical array of the land and the leaf of the world tree asked Cedros: "How?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not yet." Cedrus sat cross-legged with his hand on his head and closed his eyes as if he was resting and thinking. "You want to give me a few more reasons to help me drag on for a few days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected General Gru doesn't like to lie and ask questions but can only say no. And I can't find a better reason to delay the time." The dwarf brought up by General Gru went to Cedros and made a very weird smile. "In my mouth, you have been carrying the leaves of the world tree and ready to return it to her, but there was a small accident. I saw two old friends and went to the illegitimate child for some business. So the beautiful elves these two days. Miss's temper is getting worse and worse. We are dirty and smelly here. Monsters must leave with the gods as soon as possible. I have no choice. So we have two talents to ask about your progress."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I have no way here." Cedrus sighed. He paused. “Can this month's food be enough?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dwarf was originally a minimum official recruited by Cedros not long ago but soon This ugly guy actually has the opposite mind and talent as his appearance. So Sedros immediately let him be his assistant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a good leader, the most important thing besides your own ability is to know how to use people. With a very unique eye, Cedros knows that this is a very rare talent and a very trustworthy person. So in a short time, I was allowed to enter the top management of Oufu. Thanks to this powerful assistant, Cedros, he can also take out the magic research here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dwarf Assistant replied: "The cost of purchasing food this month has increased the number of foreign people. The problem of increasing food is also becoming more and more serious. Although it can be supported by trade in the short term. But the soil of the barren land is indeed too poor. The transport of mulch from the lizard swamp is always limited and slow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then ask them to help you get it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you ask a devout pastor to give his cross to a zombie? "Sedros smiled a bit. "The leaves of the world tree are the gods worshipped by the elves. The orcs have always been the most despised race of their high. I have to use them in this study."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The assistant nodded and shook his head and said: "But the food problem is something we must solve. It is not only a question of continuing to show, but even the key to the survival of the city. Now the exhibition of Oufu has and its own The disconnection of productivity is almost always supported by trade. Although it is indeed very prosperous but the foundation is unstable. If we stop the trade around our food supply countries... then it will be troublesome.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros shook his head: "That's not too bad. Unless there is a total of 6 famine, how can it all happen to stop trading? They also need our trade."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no such possibility. If they have reached an alliance or are controlled by a very powerful and influential organization such as the church... Of course, this situation does not seem to be big. may I was just talking about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in the eyes of Cedros, there was a flash of light and slowly nodded: "No, you are right. That is to say, we must get the power of the leaves of the world tree. If it can't be solved, then only leave this thing. If you use this thing to create a magical array, I can simulate the environment of the whispering forest. The length of the crop within it is ten times faster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you mean that this thing is not returned to the elf? But you will definitely be with them "There are hatreds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They? They only know that this thing has fallen in the hands of the Necromancer. I will make things very subtle. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistant listened to this and silenced for a while and then shook his head like a rattle: "But I feel so bad. Drinking and quenching thirst "There is nothing wrong with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Cedrus asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no wall that does not leak in the world. Your confidential work will sooner or later have the danger of leaking the wind. If this matter goes out, you think it will be What are the consequences? Not only are the elves completely opposed to you, but also other forces? This thing is good but it is a double-edged sword. Whoever takes it in his hands is the target of public opinion."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Yes." Cedrus smiled a bit. "It seems that I have been confused by this thing in the past two days. Then what good do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistant scratched the head of the mess and said: "My idea is to let the elves come to help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros missed a laugh: "I said that is impossible."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is nothing impossible." The assistant did not think so. "I have seen this in a book I have read. 'No one has no price. Some have money, some have rights, and some have beliefs. If you give enough prices, you can buy them.' Although emotionally speaking, I am more annoying but in fact it seems to be the case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedrus thought about it or shook his head. "But if they want to do this kind of thing, I will refuse what they want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That gives them a condition that cannot be refused." The assistant revealed A sly smile is a hard-to-hear laughter. It seems that a half-drunk person is playing haha. "Oh. This is what I read from the book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I seem to understand what you are talking about. But the details must be slowly Discretion..." Cedrus looked brightly at the assistant and said, "Okay. I decided that from now on you are my senior staff."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Oh. Or the Lord of the City, you have a vision. Haha." The new staff is not modest and laughs a lot. "It should be about this matter..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Cedros and the person discussed these things, General Gru did not even look at it. Here, you can only look down on the edge of the top platform and look down on the distant city of Oufu. He never cares about these things. When the two finished speaking, he came over and asked Cedros: "The world tree leaves you decided to stay? Or still go back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
