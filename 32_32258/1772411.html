			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real life of the water is far more bizarre than any enemy, and it makes people feel uncomfortable. If Asa heard that a woman like Talis in an enemy suddenly became inexplicable, it seems that it is natural to walk with a man like him. When everyone is running around in a desperate situation, the two are in a small family. The entangled and entangled in the hotel, he must feel that this enemy is a mess. But in reality, they both spent more than ten days in a hotel in Wangdu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They haven’t had any time in the past ten days. The concept is confusing and not as realistic as it is clear enough to recall every detail and every excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is two men and women who are emptied to the extreme. Only one is because the heavy shoulders are too heavy to the extreme. From a certain point of view, he does not have enough power to bear this weight. No matter how he fights to fight, he can only be as ignorant as a bystander, but under the weight of a huge emptiness and anxiety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is because the faith that was originally carried by the light is all turned into a black and she can't find anything to support herself. Even the few emotions she had had were turned into gray powder in the collision with faith. In her life, it seems that there is no longer a thing, no longer a little bit of direction, a little bit of warmth can be held in the hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is light or heavy, the emptiness of the two has long gone through all the past. This is just a pair of simple men and women who do all the things that men and women can do together. Communicate with each other in a way that communicates with each other to find comfort and warmth in each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventeen-day time soon arrived. This is the dawn of the seventeenth day. Just feeling the feeling of the magic school. Asa knows that she has to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am leaving." Asa leaned over and patted Talis, such as silk gold, and the soft touch of the skin was intertwined with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it really possible to come back?" Talis silently asked. Anyone who can see her now can no longer think that she has no woman and is indifferent. She is a woman than any woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably. I try to be." Asa thought for a moment and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going with you," Talis suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will be distracted." Asa shook her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is already illuminating. The whole king is still not fully awakened. But the School of Magic is already crowded with people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if there are some pedestrians on the street, none of them are close to the School of Magic. They couldn't see the situation in the high wall, but the kind of air that escaped from it and the king of the morning were incomprehensible. It’s not unusual to kill the air in the air. It’s like a red-hot subway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests of the Paladins and the priests of the School of Magic were rallied together and the head of Roland stood in front of them. Next to the hundreds of magicians of the Tower of the Tooth, led by Adelaide and Glendon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the Paladins did not see any difference on their faces. These are the elites of the elite who have experienced battles. Not only the warriors who are dead, but also the soldiers with steel will and discipline. It’s just that they all understand that the arduous battle of this upcoming battle and the fighting spirit of the death of nature in the dead life are already overflowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding magicians and pastors are stunned by this atmosphere. The breathing is all heavy and like a head of cattle. Many people's eyes are full of bloodshot eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already said to you that what we are facing today is an unprecedented enemy. But we must face not only for ourselves, but also for the sake behind us. Everything.” The head of Roland stood high above the statue in the middle of the square overlooking the people below. His appearance is not as good as a martial artist. He is not too much a gorgeous voice or a majestic. This simple discourse has deeper and more touching things. It uses a simple and straightforward resoluteness. Instill into the hearts of each listener. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone will die if they die. No one will not fear even me. The only way we can only face it is to defeat everything in front of us." Then live. Our rented ancestors came here like this, so we can have them now. And we will continue to go like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning light that appeared on the horizon was slight and soft, but it fell on all of them, but it seemed to be forced into a root acupuncture to hurt people and hinder people from being sober. Sting people want to fight and want to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa did not bother to fight these warriors and just walked quietly to the door of the cathedral. Here the Pope and Lancelot, Gru are both here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are here." Gru looked at him and nodded. He seems to care about where he went when he went there these days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on." Asa nodded to him and nodded to Lancelot and the Pope next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot suddenly asked: "How are these days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa I saw him with some unexpected greetings and some uncomfortable feelings. He honestly replied: "Very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's good." The knight talked about the answer. I can't see anything from his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let’s report to you on this nominal leader. All the arrangements are in place. The Western troops have gathered in the Dragon Desert to wait for us and Europe. Fu and you are there." The Pope watched him coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nodded and could not help but bend over him: "Thank you hard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Pope is also talking about his body while gently coughing. Every cough is held in his hand with a red and white handkerchief and mouth. It seems that he has been old for decades in these ten days. Although the face still looks like Adela's, anyone who can see at a glance can feel that his life is beginning to decay and the life is rushing away from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what Asa can see clearly is that he is gradually dying. The function in his body is being twisted in a comprehensive irreversible and strange way and then unbalanced. In fact, this body chanting begins between the undead monster and the creature. But the old man is desperately trying to maintain his body with the extremely high white magic. balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we are out?" asked Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are people who should have come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not long before the two elves It comes from the direction of the magic circle. It is Luya and Elf Patrolman Kailin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The elf just let them go?" Asked Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot shook his head: "Of course not. They don't have to go on that occasion and their bows and natural magic are useless. They are coming to send things." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked straight to see Asa's eyes when Luya's eyes were red. The big eyes were so sparkling that they just didn't stay. Karin’s hand still holds the huge black longbow, but she is no longer in the hands of the past but in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After the Presbyterian's deliberation, Elder Lloyd decided to promise to give you the bow used by Queen Isabel. As a compensation for our elves can not directly participate in the war. The phantom god bow legend is the treasure used by the elves of the royal family. It has defended the forests of the Sierra Leone and our elves, and we can return them to you after they have used them. I really don't know how the elders can put such treasures... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelene is still in love with Rosie. Gru took the bow in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s time to take it. Finally, Lloyd understood that I didn’t want to go to the whispering Sen.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "This feeling..." Holding the black longbow Gru, the whole person seems to have changed a bit. The sorrowful and unhappy scorpion actually passed a burst of joy and excitement. His words are not enough to express his meaning. "Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luya looked at Asa’s face and was sad and sad, but she couldn’t say anything. This elf girl has never learned how to express her feelings from beginning to end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled and reached out and patted her head and then said to Lancelot: "Well, we can go out." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
