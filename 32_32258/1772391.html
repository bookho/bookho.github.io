			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more clouds than the meteor fire and rain. The sky is full of boundless, dead gray. It seems that even the sky is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear of obedience. This is the feeling of thousands of people on the square and the eternal death of the dead gray in the sky completely shrouded everyone's feelings. What comes from the deepest part of the soul is not the face of the enemy or the fear of having a hostile anti-intentional intention when facing a monster. This is a fear that can’t resist and can’t resist. It’s the fear of a creature’s unchangeable rule power. Fear of 'death' itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Injured people with weak constitution fall silently in this breath. Everyone else and the orcs are also stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the endless breaths slowly walked out of the bright hall. The hall has been dull, and the white fluorescent light that flows all the time in the glorious castles does not exist. The white of the marble itself has become a dead gray. This man walked out of the main hall but the entire glorious castle of the entire hall was submerged under his shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground under his footsteps began to crack and shrink into carbon residue-like dregs. Only a few people in front of the main hall can see him. Even the light shining on him seems to be dead right away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Jun Lang’s face is an infinitely indifferent, dead gray scorpion, the skin of the body and the obsidian, black and lifeless, black and black. The breath oozes from him constantly. It is filled with the outside. He held the handle of the Dark Star of the Artifact of the Deva Valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This breath is originally the result of this hilt is now filled from his whole body. And it is darker, thicker and heavier. It is not that the hilt has become part of his body nor that he has become part of the hilt. The two have been completely integrated without each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the empty eyes seem to have nothing to look at and are not worth seeing but the eyes are looking in the direction. It is the four people in the main hall, Asa Gruland Slot, who is the Pope Magnus who twists Adela's body. Although all the lives of all people in front of him are dust, these dusts are indeed more noticeable than others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is it possible?" The Pope’s pale face is like a paper that has been calm and self-sufficient. His body was shaking and kept squatting. Not only does he physically squat down his spirit, but he has no sense of the weakest resistance and escape. These words are already all the intellectual struggles that he has left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the king of the dead spirit appears, all the necromancers can only become his slaves. This is the fate that Akibad has set for all Necromancers. As a price that can move freely in the Shadow Mountain Range, the Necromancer has the brand of the Dark Star in the body. This is the brand of fate. Even if he is not Adela himself, even if he is the soul of Magnus, he will be more determined. It is no different from the ants in the atmosphere accumulated by the Dark Star for thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Javier? How could it be him?" Lancelot’s face was better than Dallas. Even if it is Akibad, no one has ever seen what it would be like to get rid of the dark star that is called the annihilator. But he understands that they are seeing it now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis is sitting in the ground and hurts with cold sweat. The prosthetic at her broken hand has withered off Lanslot. Ask a cardinal to use the white magic to make a prosthetic limb. This breath is like throwing it into the stove. This breath is from her broken wrist. Spreading into the body will kill all the vitality that comes into contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All of the people who can use the light archery attack can use all of them magically." Lancelot's loud scream came out. It was only this time that the order of the paladin was no longer as calm as the hymns of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light Archery is a relatively low-level white magic. There are thousands of people on the square that can be used. With the orders of Lancelot, there are thousands of white ones. The district practiced the light belt from different angles toward Javia at the entrance to the temple. Although the light that converges together because of the distance of many spells is still dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this radiance is on Javey’s body, just let the black mist of his body fluctuate a bit and then he is swallowed up by this fog but he doesn’t even move his fingers. One. The magic that was originally designed to disintegrate the undead creatures had no effect on him. The next moment, the magician's fireball ice skating arrows, hundreds of levels of magic all flew here, but there was a white light curtain in front of him. All the magical impacts disappeared silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
