			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it good luck or bad luck? Asa thought about drinking broth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meat is good meat. Use the finest beef to dry it into a tight flesh. The meat of a cow can be finished with a small pocket. When you eat it, it will be reduced to delicious beef by boiling it with water. This is the dry food used by the noble warriors during the expedition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soup is a good soup. Even the river water in the lizard swamp is as sweet and sweet as the purest mountain spring. It is used to cook a pot of beef soup and salt. Even the chefs in the city can't pick anything wrong. It makes people feel that this purifier is indeed worth a silver coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eat this kind of good meat and drink such a good soup, even if it is a dying person will be refreshed. Asa is very clear about his physical condition and then rests for a night and he can empty a cow with empty hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bonfire is a mixture of dry wood and wet wood that is stacked with a lot of large wood and is well-mixed to ensure the next day. The heat of the bonfire will overwhelm the human body temperature over the Wyvern. The dragons can't be seen and do not have to hide in the cold tree holes and holes. Other beasts and poisonous insects don't dare to approach. Ample and steady sleep next to such a bonfire will definitely recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if I can empty the five-headed Asa, I am still not sure to fight the stalker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How physical strength is not enough to get rid of the stalker. The bonfire is warm, safe and bright enough to make any creature in the swamp visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really amazing. I first saw someone walking with a weapon and dare to walk through the lizard swamp." Woman who claims to be a pharmacist Showing a look of admiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assad does not feel that he deserves to be admired. He didn't even notice that the skin after the leeches had fallen out was still bleeding. Just a few drops of blood almost attracted the carnivorous fish in the entire swamp waters. So he had to push a dead wood that had been arched by the bulls into the river and stand on the shore to escape the countless mouths that were looking forward to him. But when a few big crocodiles joined the ranks, he had to go ashore. Time is already dusk. When he was preparing to find a place to hide, he saw the fire and he met the same kind that he had never thought of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman is probably about the same age as Asa. Although an explorer is dressed in a big parcel, he is still wrapped in a dirty blanket but white and delicate skin. It shows that it is not the identity of a civilian. Carrying the kind of efficient dry food with you and the price of a water purifier is enough for a civilian to live comfortably for a month. This woman is probably a nobleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought that I was alone in the swamp to explore the medicine. It is very unique. The terrain and climate are unique. Many plants only grow here. So although my father has never agreed, I still sneaked in. "The woman is talking like a heartless child." It’s probably not seen for a long time and it’s in such a sinister environment that the woman is not wary of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword at her waist is Anka's fine and long, hard and tough, light and dexterous to kill. Asa recognized that it was always placed in the most conspicuous place in the father's shop for the guests to scream at the sword and the price below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angle of the sword at her waist is very good and accurate so that she can draw it out as quickly as possible. The hilt is very tightly wrapped with fine hemp rope. It is the wrap that is used by experienced soldiers. After the hilt is soaked by blood, it can still not slip. Although the color of the hemp rope is still the color that has not been soaked by blood, but the grip left by the numerous swings from above, the sword will never be used for people to make a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if she is not enough to deal with the stalker. The most important thing in life and death is not skill but spirit and fighting spirit. Even if I was trained from an early age, I didn’t hear the cracking sound of the axe breaking into the human bone. I didn’t hear the wailing of the person who was cut into two pieces but was not dead for a while. I didn’t feel the enemy’s weapon in my body. The sharp pain that slashes between the rips and ribs is only a half-tone. When faced with the threat of death, when you feel the pain that can immediately submerge your mind, you will fear and shrink and lose your fighting power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is another magician or pastor, even the most basic blessings are the simplest fireballs<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa seems to be so comfortable with this sudden arrival of the broth and bonfire. It is already almost unbelievable to be able to meet humans in this jungle of hundreds of miles and enjoy the broth and replenish energy around the bonfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stalker should now peek at the fire here in a tree hole. Even when he was still eating in the night sky, the two-legged dragon had to hide. But as soon as Twilight appeared in the Eastern Wyvern to return to the nest, he would spare no effort to fly here with amazing indications of this luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it’s good luck or bad luck, since it’s already born, it’s only necessary to go as far as possible to show things to the place where you want to show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How far is it from the Dono River?" Asked Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dono River has just started to pass through the waters of the lizard swamp and has no way to swim back. Asa is forced to go ashore into the lizard swamp. But the river is gentle after bypassing the lizard swamp, as long as it flows down the water to the empire's western town of Bracada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not very clear, but it's probably a day or two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running all the way You can arrive in the next half day. No, although it is much closer than expected, there is no exact grasp of the exact distance. He is sure that the stalker can catch up with him within half a day. The chance to escape directly is too small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or tell the woman the truth and ask her to deal with the stalker. Although the chances of winning are not great, it is always better than other methods. Asa thought about how to word it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""I will take the liberty to ask if you can accompany me? I am going to go to the depths of the swamp tomorrow to find new herbs. I am still so deep in the swamp for the first time. The woman suddenly asked, "Of course I will pay you." She rubbed her hand and smashed down a few black and black stickers on her thin lips and raised a slight cramped curvature. Her heels gently twitched each other. This is a pair of women who have quite a big foot and are similar to Asa and wear a pair of shoes that are common to adventurers like Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa suddenly felt a way to escape. This is a very efficient and very promising approach. You don't need to set any traps or arrange any illusions. You don't need to consume physical strength, you don't need to waste precious time. Just a short time next to this bonfire, you can let the stalkers waste considerable time and effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This now makes his heartbeat suddenly violent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well?" The woman blinked her eyes, her eyes were not big, the eyelashes were very long, and some of the eyes were hanging. Maybe even if they were angry, they would have a kind of squat. The smile flows inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bonfire is very bright. The black blaze is soft and warm from the inside, but Asa dare not look straight. He took his eyes and took a deep breath to try to make his tone natural. "I'm sorry I can't do anything very important and urgent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh yeah?" The woman didn't know how to hide the disappointment in her tone and expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From here to the west for about half a day, there are several kinds of herbs unique to this swamp that have a unique therapeutic effect." Asa feels that her face is distorted. The meaning of the sound of the words is also ambiguous. This is the first time he has said a very malicious lie to a very friendly person. And it is for a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably? What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I saw a bull is wrong. Two bulls are bulls fighting each other. One of the hind legs is hurt. It’s not like the front foot is not as good as anyway. It’s a very serious injury. It’s going to die on the ground. Then it goes to eat. Several kinds of grass are applied to the place where I am injured and then it will be a little while." In the rush, Asa copied the story of a dog fight heard from the old adventurer when he was young. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Really? What kind of grass do you talk about?" The woman’s eyes widened and I saw it as if I saw it again five days ago. The stunned arrow almost made a dodge action that bowed his head and turned forward. The woman pulled the pen off the backpack very gracefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s a yellow flower” Asa mixed the characteristics of several wild herbs and shuffled the nonsense. The woman remembered it seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want to go deep into the swamp, you must grind the water mint and pyrethrum on the clothes and skin. Even if you There are also insect repellent oils that must be painted because there are several poisonous insects inside, but they are afraid of the taste of these two kinds of grass." Asa said to the woman with a very solemn voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
