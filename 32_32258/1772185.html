			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think I can see the black elves here." Gru looked at Jessica on the ground with a surprise look. "Get up and get out of here. I don't care about you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica trembled and stood up and retired Hilton and Druid stunned at her. It is completely unknown. They always thought that this dark-skinned companion was just a desert nomad in the south. And the inexplicably popping out of the two people and the singularly smashing of the electric phoenix have made them fall into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original kid is waiting for you." Lancelot’s eyes swam between Gru and Asa and nodded thoughtfully. . "It seems that this is not as simple as it seems. But what is there in the end? I don't want to pursue it for the time being. Just give that person to me. That's what the Pope wants me to take back."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s all nonsense." Gru stared at Lancelot to reveal a smile that was never in the slightest. His voice is getting colder and sharper. "Do you have a problem with your head? Do you think I will listen to your orders?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I never say nonsense this is to tell you the best option. Lancelot replied to Gru with a kind smile. "I can see that you are very tired and you have not been hurt in the previous hand. Your full strength can't beat Adelic and I will not be good."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not easy. I can see that it took a lot of effort to deal with this kid before. And your sword should not be used for a while. Now we both deal with you three. Or our winning face is big." Gru's slowed down the tone and spit out a word. "Not to mention that we have reason to gamble. It is much easier to kill you and two Knights of the Temple than to let you lead the attack on Oufu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Gru's voice seems to have been chilly and substantial. In the air and everyone's heart, the impact of looking at Lancelot is like two cold swords condensing from his eyes and immediately killing people. Commandment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedrus’s proposal to Gru didn’t say anything but just coughed twice. I glanced at the three Knights of the Temple and then reached out and applied the treatment to Gru's injured hand. He doesn't like Gru's plans to say it, but this kind of awkward performance is usually more chilling than any naked threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru's hand is slowly recovering with a visible degree. However, even if this kind of flesh-and-blood injury is further widened by ten times and the Holy Light Cross Sword is hard to touch, it is insignificant compared to the consumption of vindictiveness. And the kind of damage and the vindictiveness that is consumed is that no matter how advanced the treatment is, there is no possibility of a reply. But this is the same for Lancelot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While using the treatment, Cedrus’s other hand was not idle. The light of a variety of auxiliary magic is swayed in an understatement and continually illuminates on himself and on Gru's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of the auxiliary magic, the Hilton trio and the elves don’t understand. Still feel that there is something. But the faces of the two Knights of the Temple began to slowly change, and Lancelot also frowned slightly. Although these magic grades are not very high, but the number of effects is complicated. Almost all of the middle and low level auxiliary magic of the first magic system has almost become the exhibition place for auxiliary magic. The combined effects of these dozens of auxiliary magic are even better than the ‘Tianzhiyou’ on the Glorious Battle. And these complicated magics superimpose each other and affect each other even if you use purifying, you may not be able to remove it from your opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more important thing is that in such a short period of time, so many different kinds of magic spells illustrate the subtlety of this old man. The magic of the learned spells is already in full swing. Such a spellcaster who can shoot a spell like a beaded arrow is absolutely terrifying in this close combat. Even the sleek armor's protection is excellent, and the uninterrupted middle and low-level magic is not a flesh-and-blood body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot sighed. Slightly nodded and said: "I admit that the two of you are probably a little stronger than the three of us, but we are not just three people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as if to confirm His words were followed by the red cardinal Adela and his entourage with the help of the distant entourage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the expressions on Gru and Cedros Adela’s face instantly reveals the unexpected sorrow and sorrow and then laughs: “Good this It’s really the gift of my Lord. All the attackers kill...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His laughter just opened the gold bow of the hands of Willske and he was already on the string. The reaction on the battlefield is not to laugh at the enemy after seeing the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the only ones who came to see the two masters of Oufu were the quickest and most intense reaction. His eyes stared straight at Gru'a's thin face, and he was suddenly angered by the angry fighting spirit and the smothering of the eye. In the twinkling of an eye, he has already been bent and bowed. When the cardinal voice just came out, it was only a one-meter long steel broken magic arrow that had been as fast as a lightning bolt and went straight to the line... Cedros. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Wellskey’s eyes and killings are all on Gru, but his arrow is taken next to the old man. He only saw at a glance that this is the most crucial part. The controller is always the strongest and weakest link in the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, although he responded quickly but was faster, it was Cedros, and his face began to change when he saw the figure of the Cardinal. Immediately, he took out a transfer reel and whispered to Gru: "Go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Gru looked at Asa on the ground and hesitated At this time, a shot of Wellskey has been shot. At this moment, the great battle bow on the body and hands of Wellske and the golden dazzling light at the same time, the person and the bow can not tell whether the brilliance on the bow is infected with the human body or the vindictiveness of the person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the ears within 100 meters of the arrow are full of sharp whistling. But this is by no means the air within 100 meters of the arrow that the arrow itself is out of the sound. The arrow just pulled off the string and pulled all the air around it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than one meter long thumb and thin steel broken magic arrow with dazzling light as a golden rushing out of the thunder is almost able to drive Power. Even if the front is not the arrow of the golden cracked stone, but an arrow like a large group of cotton shot people can definitely die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedrus’s reaction was definitely fast enough. He saw that the goal was himself when he saw a bow of Wellske. But he did not hide even if he had added dozens of auxiliary magic, he still could not escape such a swift and unpredictable arrow. He doesn't even use the magic of the protective arrows. Although these magics are used, they are not much slower than the blink of an eye. But whether it is a whirlwind aegis or a position shield, there is not much difference between such an arrow and a thin piece of paper. So he is not a defense but an offense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of his attack is not the one who attacked him but the nearest Lancelot. He left a small range of slowness in his left hand and then his right hand with two beads of ice and then his left hand followed by a lightning bolt. However, it is the blink of an eye. He has already made three series of four magics. This hand is enough to surprise the three Knights of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s amazing to be surprised that the effect of this magic is almost limited to surprises and has been slowed down by the brilliance of the armor and the knights themselves. Ice Christine’s silver giant sword immediately smouldering out of the smoldering light, but it was just hitting Lancelot’s chest, but the white light of his vindictive and magical mixture was only slightly brighter and brighter than the shackles in the ocean. A little spark disappeared without splashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these four magics also slightly blocked the movement of the three Shrine Knights to give Gru the time. Because they are also moving at the same time as Wells, but their goal is Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just this short moment that the tacit understanding and trust between the two groups has been fully demonstrated. Wellske had already known that his goal was to be Cedros. All of them also shot the goal at the same time is the only Gru that could save Cedros. But the only good attack from Cedrus is that Gru has a chance to pick up an arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is only one person in the world who can grab the illuminating arrow of Willske with bare hands, this person must be Gru. Just in the moment when the golden giant bow was full of strings, he was already alert that he had stepped into the white light and had already handed the golden light that would tear the surrounding air around to restore the steel arrow. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng Deng Deng everyone can feel the trembling of the ground and hold the broken arrow of Gru, step back two steps and three steps to stand. The ground where he fell on each foot was deeply recessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the body of the three-step Gelu stepped back, the vindictiveness of the hand was weak and weak, and even the face changed slightly. But the vindictiveness and killing that he dissipated in the next moment immediately came back in a thousand times. He screamed at the broken magic arrow in his hand and threw it at Wellske. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
