			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?" On the road not far from Airy City, a man who was marching towards the horse was horrified at the direction of the whispering forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the man is a gold woman with a full body knight armor. She also seems to feel the magical fluctuations in the air turning around and asking the man: "What is going on?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, it won't be a good thing. Go away." The man's face changed and he rushed away in the direction of the whispering forest. The horsewoman immediately followed the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side is farther away. Three air elements above the sky are carrying three people who are also flying here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tamik is the same direction." A white magical eyeball suspended above the templar's head. This eyeball is not too big but is flexible and unusually turning around the templar's head and scanning the white pupil that is now looking forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you feel the things that the Pope is confessing?" The Tamek Knight is still looking at his face. The air elements of the ride were blowing in the air at high altitudes, and the eyes of the other two Templars were not able to speak and almost use them. Only his voice that still looks like that is not big but clearly passed to the ears of the other two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are three very strange magical fluctuations that have not been felt before. I don't know for a while what one of them is." The templar answered and he immediately breathed a sigh of relief and the magical eyeball turned into a white magical wave that returned to his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After using this magic, the Templar seems to be a little hard. The magical power of this kind of white magic requires great perseverance and sacrifice to study hard and learn to use it. When it comes to practice, it takes a lot of magic power. Convenience and fineness cannot be compared with the magical eyes of water magic. . However, the unique perception of white magic makes the range of the sensory. When used, the person is almost a living magic map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to use this kind of magic is definitely the most scarce talent. Like the Tamik Knights, they are also the only ones who belong to the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The other Masters of the Tower of the Tooth also started fighting. I feel that one of the strongest ones seems to be applying a big magic in the air. They should also be We went to the place and we were..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the people who took the things were killed," answered the Tamek Knight. His face is still as simple as a piece of wood sound is also like describing a piece of wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the arrow of rain from all angles. All directions from the magicians to the surrounding dense wood guards and ancient trees became the best hideaway for the elf archers. The magicians did not seem to see where the arrows came from. But these arrows don't play much role. The periphery of dozens of magicians has a circle of nearly 100 elements. The giants form a circular protection. Even the precise shooting of the elves can pass through between these elements. . But these arrows in the face of the magical magicians are just the effect of using some protective magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of each magician here is the effect of the master class elemental protection magic. In particular, the hurricane shield that surrounds each magician's body is immediately swayed by the whirlwind once the arrow is close, so that all the arrows that are shot are invalidated. And even if there are arrows, you can cross the hurricane Aegis. Now every magician's body is attached with thick earthen magic armor and even the knife and axe are not effective. In addition, the floating flame shield and water curtain are all the same. Thick and flexible. It’s more effective than a warrior with a shield next to the guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical magic of the Elf Masters is unbearable under the destruction of elemental magic, especially flame magic. It is a dead wood guard or a poisonous vine poison. In the flame electric light, almost no effect on the ground becomes a powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s just a one-on-one situation, the natural magic that is so different and different may not be so vulnerable, but two or three of this group of magicians The fire department* is specially responsible for defending the fire wall flame shields and the aura of the fire, etc. It is almost impossible to pass through the natural magic and then change the magic. Those summoned poisonous vines and animals are more and more different from different perspectives. Can't drill completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magicians have entered the forest, and there are hundreds of dead wood guards already gathered together. But even the steps of the magicians did not stop, but continued to pull the surrounding encirclement and continue to rush into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
