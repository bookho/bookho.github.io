			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The edge of the forest in southwestern Sierra Leone. A middle-aged man dressed as a farmer squats under the shade of a big tree. He was surrounded by a basket of harvested berries. The midday sun is not big. Through the gap between the leaves, it was scattered on the face that seemed to have been boring by poverty and boring. His face was filled with some calm, fresh words that infiltrated the peculiar indifference. Maybe this basket of berries is enough for his family to eat and drink for a week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tula Leone Forest is a place where the elves are rarely occupied. The farmer seems to be passing by. Only the sound of birds singing around is mixed with the wind. The world is quiet and natural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange noise suddenly came from deep in the forest to break the peace around. This is not too big a sound, but the ground is in the slight vibration of the forest, countless birds are stunned and there are animals 6 continually flying out of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer-like man stood up from the ground and watched the face of a lot of animals running out of his own side, showing a little surprised look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this strange shock, the forest seems to be like the wind, but it is more invisible than the wind, spreading across the forest and spreading across the entire area. Every inch of space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer’s face was completely surprised by the look he looked at in the depths of the forest as if he were watching the miracle of the god of creation. Then the next moment his movements were completely out of the scope of a farmer. He jumped on his own tree and jumped to the top of the tree with a quick agility than the apes. This is a tall tree that is much taller than other trees, so he will choose to rest and enjoy the following. Now he can see some of the depths of the forest on the top of the tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge blue light condenses in the depths of the forest without scattering. The clouds in the sky seem to be blue in this ray of light. The constant strange volatility spreads out from there and covers the entire territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a strange sound and a tremor on the ground. This does not seem to be the vibration caused by the sound. It is the sound of the vibration of the ground. There seems to be a huge monster walking in the depths of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer has not been like a farmer at this time, like a lizard warrior who has been honed in the jungle for decades, flying in the trees The more the apes are unable to match the degree and agility rushed towards the depths of the woods. In the depths of this forest is the largest of the 6 largest elves, and the elves do not like humans and there are strange magic enchantments to prevent humans from approaching. But this farmer, who is not like a farmer, is now rushing very quickly and hurriedly as if there were hundreds of thousands of baskets of berries waiting for him to harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great vibrations and sounds are born at a fixed frequency. But only a few more times, this sound disappeared. Then the whole forest returned to calm and this time because the birds and beasts almost all of them were shocked. The calm was completely silent without any sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be close to the bird. It didn't take long for the farmer to come to the periphery of the elves' settlements, but there seems to be no protection or obstruction. He just hesitated and rushed into the boundaries of the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deepest trees in the forest are the tallest and the strongest. There are countless exquisite trees and trees that are integrated with the trees and other elves are uniquely built. It is built into a spectacle that is absolutely invisible to other places. But the strangest thing about this wonder is that it is empty. No traces of elves or even animals appear here. It is actually a quiet view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer’s face has been replaced by the slightest lust and replaced by the look of a lone wolf strolling through the wilderness jungle. He walked slowly and quietly in this silent wonder. Look at the trees around the ground and even the sky. The farmer knew that the huge blue light that had just exploded here had disappeared. Although he couldn't see the time when the blue light in the sky dissipated while running in the woods, he could feel the dissipation of the fluctuations. Although he feels such fluctuations, he is not sure about what he feels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked to a stone bench in the middle of the Elf city, he finally stopped and looked at Shitai. There is a trace of a huge magical array of ten meters on the stone platform. He can see that it should be a magical array. But now the magical gems on this magical array have completely disappeared from the position of the most precious star of the eye in the center. There are a bunch of blue broken pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
