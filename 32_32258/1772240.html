			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised everyone was that the Queen’s face was not only a tooth decay but her expression was also twitching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty." Several old ministers rushed a few steps but stopped their feet. They all could see that the Queen’s face was not painful, and it seemed like a kind of carnivore that was similar to a hungry but more horrible expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal reached out and stopped: "Please take care of the vampire's nature and completely replace the human nature. I have to use white magic to her. It was banned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How could this be? The Queen’s Majesty a few days ago... Isn’t it all right? And the Queen’s Majesty has always been gentle and sorrowful. If she is really a vampire, how can she always be safe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal sighed and said: "In fact, she showed up a few days ago. When it’s uncomfortable, it’s time for the Necromancer to begin to control him. The vampire’s factor was only lurking in her body and it didn’t work. I felt a little abnormal when I was treating my underarms, but it’s only after the truth... ...the days when the blood is coming out is actually the Queen’s Majesty, but I have not announced it in order not to stun the snake.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Janssen looked at the Queen’s trembling in bed Said: "You first put the queen on his body. The law is solved, we have to ask her personally what is going on..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal shook his head and said, "I am afraid she can't answer any questions you have now... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You first unravel." The old minister sank. Although he is already wrinkled and white. But such a drink is still full of temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Jia Wei shook his head slightly. Stretched his hand over the body of the queen on the bed. The Queen’s body immediately slammed her and sat up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty. I ask you this is..." The old minister asked me one step forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen’s answer is a scream that is steep but tears the human diaphragm. While screaming, her petite and weak body rushed toward Jensen’s minister with a disproportionate degree. Her mouth was as open as the snake’s mouth. The joint between the upper and lower jaws was so sharp and sharp. The white fangs are aimed at the old minister of Jensen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this fierce bit did not really fall on the old minister. Next to Rhodes Hart and Bishop Javier's movements are faster than the Queen's. They seem to have already expected the Queen's reaction and at the same time grabbed the Queen's body limbs and pushed her back to the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the name of the Lord, all things are not clean and evil." In the mouth of the bishop of Jiawei, the chain of mourning of the white magic is quickly hidden into the Queen's Majesty. In the body, the queen immediately fell to the bed and could not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old minister of Jensen took a step back and his feet were shaking. He was not because he was scared but an incredible horror. Everyone can see that the action of the Queen's Majesty has not been the slightest taste of the people. It seems that a wolf who has been hungry for hundreds of years has seen a pile of fresh blood. There is also the ‘light bondage’ used by the cardinal, which is the magic that only has a certain binding force on the undead monster. These are all irrefutable evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the faces of the old ministers are all unbelievable and desperate. Both the Bishops of Jawi and Rhodehart have different degrees of pain and intolerance. . But among all of them. Naturally, the look of the prime minister's face is the most complicated. The most painful. Her lower lip has been bitten by her beak. But the expression and vision on his face still persisted without collapse. She first looked at the Queen and then the Cardinal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry." Bishop Jia Wei sighed long and there was no falsification in it. He felt the pain and anger in her eyes and the sorrow, and he even felt that he felt a little bit of pain. But it feels that it will be suppressed in a flash, because it must be done now. He looked at her sincerely and said: "I am sorry that the prime minister is actually not wanting to show things to this point... but some things have been born. I only have to deal with it like this. Please forgive me and I will try my best to deal with it. This thing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more things in the eyes of prime ministers. She slowly opens her mouth but the sound is still calm and calm: "things It’s already at this point and it’s all nonsense. Let’s talk about what you plan to do. Call us here. It’s not just for these reasons...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;“And more important?” The voices of several ministers were several times higher. They really can't imagine what will happen more seriously than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the clues that I and Rhodes Hart have, the Queen’s Majesty is probably the Dark Duke and the Bishop of Ronis, who have been under the control of that person. The wanted man. This time his original plan was to control the imperial court when the emperor and Roland’s head were not in the king’s capital, and Geffenhardt’s majesty was dangerous...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Mins immediately shook his head and said: "There is no problem with the support of the leader of the Holy Knights with the head of Roland, and there is no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Bishop Jia Wei sighed and said: "I hope so too... But Her Majesty the Queen has now become like this. If there is anything wrong with His Majesty and Colonel Roland, then the empire will not have any claims at all. In order to pre-plan, I suggest that you first discuss the countermeasures."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Marquis of Minsk suddenly asked: "The Queen’s Majesty can still treat this. Okay? Can you ask the Pope to condescend to love Enfast? As long as he can heal the Queen, he believes that His Majesty will definitely be on Celeste from now on..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Jia Wei shook his head and said: "Things have arrived. At this point, I think that even the Pope and the three Cardinals of ours may not be able to do anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several ministers have despair on their faces The color. Minister Jensen shook his head and sighed: "If your Majesty knows this. He..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal continues: "According to what I and Rhodes Hart know I am afraid that the wanted criminal has always had a relationship with the Descartes. If he is invited to the Necromancer to deal with His Majesty and the head of Roland, I am afraid it will be worrying. I propose to send a large army immediately to meet the next king."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Marquis of Minsk and several ministers also hurriedly nodded: "There will be no problem if you squat down as soon as possible..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you seem to be a bishop? You must be so sure that you will have an accident?" The prime minister suddenly said: "If you take the troops of Wangdu, what if you have anything to do here?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal said: "I think it is more important to rescue the Majesty. And naturally it is impossible to take all the troops of the Kings to the Guards. The presence of the Paladins and the Lord Rhodes should also be enough to cope with any situation. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime minister is cold and cold: "The Paladin is not like the Guards. The whole king can only be mobilized if you work together. If something happens." At the time, one of the two of you will not pay attention to it or even if you both figure out what to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they are very flustered, the ministers can still hear the prime minister. There is something wrong with the words. They all looked at her in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All that is just what you said in the two populations is not necessarily the truth." The prime minister took a deep breath and first looked at the bed. The Queen of the Earth then looked at the light in the eyes of both Rhodes Hart and Bishop Javey and finally completely dispersed. She raised her voice and looked at the ministers around me and said, "I believe that the head of Roland will have a way to protect his next week. I also believe that there is definitely more hidden hidden behind the Queen's Majesty. You don't have to panic. When Roland’s escort came back, everything was calm.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt frowned at the prime minister’s voice and said, “Now he is very likely to kneel down. At the end of the crisis. How can we wait for the prime minister? We know that the Queen’s Majesty’s work will definitely make you sad. But please accept the reality with state affairs. Do you think that I and Javy Bishop will talk nonsense on this kind of thing? "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small you calm down." Minister Jensen patted the prime minister's shoulder and said softly. He is watching the prime ministers grow up to know that the two sisters have long been emotionally dependent on their feelings before their father died. "I’m afraid it’s the only way now. After all, we can’t take risks in our lives.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime minister has looked helplessly at this grief but the compassionate old minister The old ministers are also the same look with him. She only feels deep helplessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old people have used their entire life to serve the royal family. Even from the perspective of the courtiers, the safety of the emperor is indeed the first. I have been born with such incredible things that they dare not believe. And the benevolent disciple in front of him. Even if you say that all of this is actually the result of the summons they have planned, it just makes people feel that they are out of order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
