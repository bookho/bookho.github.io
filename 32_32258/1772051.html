			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa flies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three cavalry raised their swords toward him and rushed to the mouth to scream and scream as if they were chasing prey. The imperious minister’s tone of enthusiasm has made them eager to make meritorious deeds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After approaching Asayan’s hand, a cavalry in the middle of a fireball fell down and planted the horse. The other two cavalry stunned Asa to seize the opportunity to rush and step on a horseman's horse head directly past them and continue to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front is where the cavalry are slashing the villagers. The grass on the side of the grass has been stained with blood. The screams of the villagers are decreasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa rushed directly into the cavalry and jumped on the horseback and cut two cavalry. The other cavalry suddenly panicked and they wanted to come over and deal with his formation. The Asa machine rushed past the gap in the middle. In front of it is sitting in the right to watch the cavalry killing the imperial minister and the local official. It is impossible to deal with so many cavalry alone. It is natural to find a commander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was almost no time for the two to react and they were rushed by Asa and pulled down the horse. Asa immediately shouted the knife holder on the neck of the imperial minister: "All do not move me." The cavalry immediately stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only a few children left in the pool, still standing in blood and crying as if there is nothing hurt. The villagers have protected the children in the human wall. Only the hunter Levin took the weapon of a cavalry and struggled to fight. He had already smashed a few knives and mixed blood. There are still people in the pool of blood that are constantly embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial minister who was stalked by the knife was not very flustered and still kept his scholarly demeanor and the authority of the officials with a very disdainful tone: "forgive you I don’t dare to hurt me. The soldiers here have seen you. If you dare to hurt the emperor’s imperial messenger, you will become the wanted criminal of the entire empire. And even your family”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly interrupted his speech with a cry that was harder than killing a pig. Asa broke his finger and said coldly: "I have never been interested in hurting someone else's head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few times the imperial minister is struggling I also want to keep his proper tone and say: "You actually dare to hurt a cleric such a crime will be suffered." He immediately felt the tearing of the joints of the other two fingers. The two were originally close. The skeleton suddenly pulled the flesh next to it at an unprecedented angle. The muscles of the whole arm began to twitch because of this severe pain. He made another animal-like call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call them to lay down their weapons. Hurry up." Asa grabbed the three fingers of his other hand this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's put down the weapon and let me put down my weapon!" The imperial minister screamed and screamed and shouted at each other's tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two slight footsteps sounded behind them. Asa jerked around and slashed a knife at the back of the cavalry who wanted to sneak attack. The cavalry screamed and flew out a few steps full of blood on the ground and rolled. A few bloody teeth flew to the side of Dot, and he immediately stopped the handcuffs that were rubbed around his waist and sweated there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa used the knife back to crack the soldier’s face. He did not want to kill the two cavalry who had just been slashed and was not fatally wounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the people have laid down their weapons. I don't want to say it again." Asa grasped the hand of the imperial minister's finger and tightened the imperial minister immediately crying to help him. Repeated the command of the scholars and the generals who had just commanded the fascination, but they did not know what to say: "Let's put down the weapon and he said everything. Do you want to watch him kill me?" The cavalry immediately rushed to the ground. Turned over and dropped the weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked at the rest of the villagers and there were still a few injuries. Now it is just how far they can go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa let go of the imperial minister’s hand and tightened the knife on his neck and said, “Do you have any seals or tokens? Come out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is." The imperial minister shook his hand into his arms and took out a seal more than the most obedient child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa took a seal and threw it to Rodhart. "Go and take a few horses and bring the still-lived and injured people into the city to find a doctor to bandage the first aid. Someone on the road asks for this seal. It is said that it is the meaning of imperial adults. The imperial adults annihilated the pagans in the forest and they have to chase after a few days to recover. These are wounded soldiers. After they have finished, take them away and escape as far as possible."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seal fell at Rod Hart’s feet but he didn’t even look at it. He buried his face in his hands and pulled his fingers on the flesh of the forehead and cheeks as if to smash his facial features. Tears spilled from the fingers and he didn't cry, but the whole person was shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa suddenly flew a kick to his face and said: "Cry yourself and roll back and cry slowly. You have to cry these people." Is it here?" He slashed his body and made a bloody mark on the neck of the imperial minister. The minister screamed like a sheep and the pig was immediately wet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt was kicked by the kick a few times on the ground and squatted on the grass. It seems that he is breathing and he suddenly stands up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His two swords and eyebrows tried their best to get together and put the lower lip in the mouth and bite him with the neat teeth. The blood didn't know if he had bitten it out or just kicked it. The tears on his face and the expression on his face merged into a sad heroic spirit on his face. He picked up the seal and quickly gave the injured villagers a simple wrap up of the horses that brought in several cavalry and helped them all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked at the dozens of horses left by the cavalry and asked the hunter Levin: "Is it too heavy? Can you move?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still no time to die." Hunter Levin slammed the wound and said that his wounds were deep and blood was still flowing out. Fortunately, his physique was strong enough to support live. Asa gestured to him to extend a hand and press on his wounds to do his best to use healing spells. His lack of interest in healing and less practice to practice these are already limits. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said to the hunter Levin: "Come the horses here as far as possible. The farther away from the city, the horses are far away from the city." . As long as the horses are all driven away, even if the situation on their own cannot be controlled, they can win a lot of time for the villagers who have escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunter Levin turned and went to the side of the road, and suddenly he was beaten up until he was slammed on the ground before turning to the horse. Take it away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Rod Hart’s departure from the hunter Levin, the villagers also rushed into the forest. Asa finally breathed a sigh of relief and then the anger that had been suppressed for a long time came out. He reached out and grabbed the fat on the neck of Dot. He pulled him over like a dog and tied him with the imperial minister. Asked on the person's neck: "I decided to slaughter one of you and leave one as a hostage. You two said that you should die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He damn it!" The two said in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is bigger than my official. These are his ideas. He said that he wants to kill these people." Dout's fat All of them are like a pig in the sound. "I am just a small official and they all told me to do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am much more convenient than being thin as a hostage." The imperial minister is worthy of Scholars know to emphasize their strengths. Also raised his own hand that was broken by Asa's finger seems to be showing off a great feat. "You see that I have been made this way. I don't want to die." He snotted his tears together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their pleadings and pity like Asa did not care. I don't know when the red robe who was on the edge of the whispered singer has quietly walked over into the bodies of the villagers and squatted there. The cavalry had long since had no idea of ​​who had not taken care of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dow, who was originally on the ground, did not know where the courage and strength suddenly came up and ran to the red robe. He even climbed to the side of the red robe and said, "This gentleman, I have already done the death row of the city in your place as you said."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red robe stood up and nodded and said, "I have received the good body of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special request: "I know that you are a magician. I have seen you use magical magic. Please save the imperial minister from the mob." He knows that even if he can be rescued now, if the imperial minister is dead, he will also I can't live the same. Just a few dozen people here have heard him shirking responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
