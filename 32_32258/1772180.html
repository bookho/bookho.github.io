			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know which elf’s first air magic effect has disappeared under the cardinal’s purse, and the arrow that shoots the hand immediately shoots into the side. A thief's neck and then a half arrow from the other side. The thieves whispered with eccentric wailing. The bright red liquid from his hands continually poured out from his fingers and he slowly fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were nearly a hundred thieves who took the lead in the middle and immediately became the living targets of the surrounding elves. 3. It’s just a few blinks of martial arts. The thieves all screamed and lay down. Only a few luck is particularly good, but only the other ones are killed by an arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issie is very lucky. The two thieves who held him were almost killed by one arrow at the same time. He also stood up and fell together and was not shot in the first round of arrows in the elves. When there is an elf, the fisherman of this shade net is about to make up an arrow. The cardinal has said: "Please leave me with the collar. I think there must be someone behind them. I will slowly investigate and ask." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, there are only two people who are inextricably linked to Helicika and Talis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika is almost really crazy. He smirked and waved his hands and swords. The giant slasher that weighed hundreds of pounds was as fast as a squirting airflow and even the elves in the distance felt it. There were several elves who had shot at him but the arrow was shot into the hurricane that the giant sword provoked and was immediately blown like a hay. Take away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika’s brains have nowhere to go. Because he knows that he can't win. Even if he won the knight, there are ten templars and a more powerful knight. There are also the Cardinal and the hundreds of thousands of elves on the periphery. He is like a beast that has been locked into a cage. The enemy assigned to him is only because this enemy wants to kill him personally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All reasoning is useless and desperate to become murderous. In addition to the crazy killing in his mind, there is nothing else. He now only wants to kill what he can kill. Can kill ten or ten is even if he can't kill him, he can even kill himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a loss of rational restraint. The ten original human nature has been distorted more like a beastly person who has accumulated so many years of violent madness all over his soul. Go out. The vibrations of every muscle in every ten movements now come directly from the mad soul. That too much crazy killing in his body impact, even this crazy attack has nowhere to vent. He even bite off his lower lip in the battle and chewed it. The violent blast is not only the strength of the body but also the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis's long sword was broken in the first interaction with Hilika's two-handed sword. A templar at the back immediately threw her own gun to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the storm of the two-handed sword. The Knights of the Temple, who had been blessed by the glory of the armor, had been rushing to the ground with the guns and the swords as the rain. In a short while, the steel guns opened three small holes in the muscles of the Heilika barrier. Talis was still unharmed, but she had already fallen into the wind and was shunned. In the face of a fundamental do not care about being hurt or not even winning or losing, I just want to do everything I can to wave your sword. Even biting you a monster like this is no longer a common fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the current Helicika seems to be no longer personal. The highly concentrated spirit and the mad murder catalyze both the ** and the spirit to the extreme swelling of the muscles and the huge body. The blood and the red vindictiveness are mixed together. The whistling in the throat made the frog elves show the look of fear and disgust as they saw a legendary hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning, Archbishop Adra was a little more than a fairy girl in the distance but gradually moved to Helicika. His expression also appeared to be more interested in seeing a very fun thing. He turned to ask the Knights of the Temple left behind: "Is the thief of the Welsh Knights very good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If not sacred The Glorious Warrior's 塔 塔 塔 塔 骑士 骑士 骑士 骑士 塔 ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔. "This person's body and martial arts are called the upper stream. Unfortunately, the red vindictiveness is the result of killing too much blood and too much blood. Those who can control this bloody fight are real violent people. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal screamed and thought about what he thought: "Is it the pride of the Knights of the Megatron? Can't you deal with the collar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yuyou, but what she lacks is the lack of experience. The most needed enlightenment in this life-and-death battle is the soul, so she is lost. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps and movements of Talis in the venue were all messed up with the words of Wellskey. She even looked back and saw that the colleague was almost blinded. Hilika cut.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple slowly raised the golden bow in his hand and reached out with an arrow from the back. This string of strings was overflowing. Jin Guang’s bow is one person tall. Even in the hands of the burly tall Welsh Kay, it seems that the frog is too big. The suit of Wellskey and the other Knights of the Temple are completely different from his body. Glorious Battlegear does not have a part of the right chest and the right shoulder. The bare shoulders and the arms are large and thick. The above-mentioned gluten is as clear as a sculpture. It is even stronger than the mutated muscles of Helicika. The huge arm has been hanging down to the knee and the owner's body is completely uncoordinated. It seems to be cut from a giant and then grafted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arrow is one meter long. The thick steel arrow of the thumb is also engraved with fine Pattern. Although the airflow of the Helicia branded two-handed sword makes the arrows of the fine arrows impossible to penetrate, this arrow will never be. Just now, the approval of Skye once shot this kind of arrow object is a taller and stronger than the Greek card. Three or four times as many as the dead wood guards. The arrows did not smash through and smashed through the wooden body guarded by the dead wood, and the whole dead wood guards were torn apart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" and many more. Knights of Wales. You don't need to shoot. The Cardinal suddenly reached out and stopped the Knights of the Temple. He turned his head and said to him. "Javier will wait for you to take him down." He paused to remind him. "Remember to live, try not to let his body hurt too much." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Shrine had a frog accident, but he did not say anything but just silently closed the bow and put away the arrow.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "The young templar is stepping forward. The face is still a gentle and amiable joke. This person seems to be jealous at all times.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A muffled sound on the ground, and the giant sword of Hilika slashed on the ground and hit a big pit. Talis took a shot and stabbed him on his lower abdomen. The half-length gun tip was all in the rock-like muscles. But this gun is only so far that the muscles on both sides of the rifle can no longer be pulled into Talis and can't be pulled out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika does not have Showing a little bit of pain or a surprised look. This shot made him more excited and more mad. He held the sword with both hands and headed down to Talis.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Talis finally pulled out the gun and pulled out the ground with a blood arrow and a bow. She shot the gun and slammed back and slammed the gun of the pure steel gun in the hands. The sword's slashing was turned into a big u. The female knight's hands and the tiger's mouth were split and the guns were thrown out by the sword.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika opened the mouth that was bitten by himself and dragged the viscera that had spilled out of the body and laughed and chased the horsewoman. Whether it is a gentle word like a wolf like a tiger The demon metaphor is not enough to describe what he is now. Power and fierceness. Even the elves around them are exclaiming.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flying Talis felt a soft and ten-something that had already caught her volley. She was horrified and turned back and saw a sunny, white-eyed joke.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord Talis has worked hard for the bishop to call me to take over. The Templar smiled and gently put her down. Then she flew to meet the rushing Helica.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait for you alone..." Tower Lisi stretched out her hand and tried to stop it, but her hand could not be lifted. Although the combat power of the Templar was already a first-class player compared with the ordinary warrior, it was not only a little worse than the Knights of the Temple with a shining armor. Point. Throw away that amazing protection. It’s just that the 'Tianzhiyou’ that can be moved once a day can already put a lot of combat power away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Even ordinary soldiers who have blessed Tianzhiyou can deal with a dozen opponents whose strengths are similar. Although there is almost no magic that can be directly attacked by White Magic, it can still be seen with other magical elements. The frog's auxiliary effect is amazing. But now the Cardinal has let the Templar hold up for Talis, but does not mean to add any magic to him. And the Javier did not give himself any magic to rush to it. for <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilika didn’t care who he was facing. The only thought he had now was to kill only the war. He roared. The holy sword with both hands ushered in The samurai went straight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Javi Warrior did not retreat but pulled out the sword and greeted the two-handed swords in front of him. His hand was just a plain steel sword. And Helicopter compares the two-handed sword. It is no different from teeth. But now he is using this little toothpick to face the huge monster that is stabbing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis and all the Templars, including the face of Wellskey, have changed under the action of Jarvis. Although they all admire the talent and martial arts of this young warrior, this is the opposite. Hard-to-hard interactions can't be changed by any talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the Cardinal is still the face of the auspicious face. I don’t know if he can’t understand the battle between the fighters or have enough confidence in his arrangement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two swords are sharp and the sharp swords of the long steel sword and the two-handed sword are almost the tip of the semi-spherical ball. A cracked sound steel sword with no suspense was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only Jianwei’s arm is also backed by a huge force. The dull sound is in turn almost simultaneously from his wrist. The elbow joint came from the shoulder joint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just the blink of an eye. The golden giant bow that Willis Kay’s put down has already raised the huge steel arrow that is full of strings. between. All the movements are more than one stream. The cloud only needs one-fifth of the blink of an eye. It is enough to change any situation and the arrow can be irritated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this arrow still didn't go out. Because it is in the blink of an eye. He saw the reversal of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword broke the elbow and shoulder joint dislocation, but the two-handed sword also squatted slightly under the attack. Jia Wei’s body is still rushing to the side and breaking the sword to the left hand. Partially open the double sword from the side of his body. The clothes are broken and the skin is broken. However, the body of the Templar was also intertwined with the body of Helicika and the sword was cut in the elbow joint of his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two-handed swords are still stabbing in the front but they have pulled out of the palm of Hilika and flew for a long distance before they fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika is coming. His head, which was suffocated and madly over-excited, was also clear and clear in this strange. He didn't feel any pain. But the two have completely lost control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade of the broken sword did not cut too deep and absolutely no poetry cut into his barrier-like muscles. But the place where Hu's anal muscle tendon is connected is just a little bit. Javi’s broken sword just cut the tendon that Helicha’s elbows gathered together. The depth and precision are just better than the oldest butcher’s old-fashioned butcher’s blood, so the whole body is already bloody. Did not feel the pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika can feel all the touch of the hands, but no matter how hard he uses, he can’t move. He only feels that the broken muscles are shrunk under the skin. . His legs and knees felt the same when he was caught. The next moment his huge body collapsed and he could no longer stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is a powerful muscle, then the violent vindictiveness and fighting spirits are broken. Just like the exuberant fire, the fuel will be extinguished immediately. The monsters that are just as energetic and violent as the killing machines that will never be tired will fall forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javier Warrior stood in the straight handle and inserted the broken sword back into the scabbard. Use your left hand to reset your dislocated joint and use the upper treatment. The dislocation of the joints was not easy. He had a cold sweat on his forehead, but his face was still a relaxed and easy-going smile. It was only that he looked at the eyes of Helicika on the ground without a slight smile and a kind of cold and firm satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Templar and the Knights of the Templar are only slightly changed in expression, but the elves around them burst into a thrill of excitement. The female patrol who raised the black longbow also let out the bow in his hand. She looked at the knight who also carried a golden giant bow and saw the other side, but she slammed the bow back and waved back and snorted. Today, she shot twice and failed twice, and she was always indignant when she accidentally injured her allies. Seeing this shrine knight who also uses bows and arrows has long had a comparative meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wellskey seems to have also felt the female elf’s eyes turned to look at her and the black elf longbow in the eye and then Indifferently nodded and said: "Good bow is not something you can use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
