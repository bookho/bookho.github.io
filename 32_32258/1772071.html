			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa now feels a little admired by Bolugan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although from the results, he did not expect it to be accurate. The big ear owls did not sell the looted goods or said they could not. These goods are now not part of the big-eared monsters. Other orcs have already confiscated them all. Although the city's main inhabitants are orcs, the core managers are said to be humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As expected, it is indeed the same as the human kingdom that circulates gold and silver currency and there are also dwarves and human merchants trading here. However, none of these merchants came from the empire, all from the wild west of the country and the small country of the southwestern empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Bolugan also said that this place should be a very orderly place. At that time, Asa did not care what the meaning of this 'order' meant until he entered it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed where the beasts of all races gather and live. Almost all buildings are constructed with huge stones that have been stripped from nearby mountains. decoration. But it is not because it is more than ten times more architectural style than Brakada and that the main inhabitants are orcs and show the slightest barbarism, but it seems to be more disciplined and rules than human society. On the periphery of his northern end are a few separate living quarters that are separated and used to feed orcs of various races such as the demon wolf. It is the independent territory of the various orcs who are completely managed by themselves. In the middle of these residential areas is the center of the city-state called ‘Oufu’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge stone monument on the square in the center of the city of Oufu, which is very simple and clearly engraved with the laws of the city. Even the most dwarfs with the most eyesight can see clearly in the distance. The strokes cut by the axe are not deep enough to be beautiful, but the regulations should be neat and meticulous but the performance is in place. The scope of this regulation is not too big, it is just the central town of Oufu. The content is quite similar to the human law. Many places seem to be looser. These terms are used to maintain order. The biggest difference and the amazing thing is that the above wording is very concise. It only writes what kind of behavior is forbidden and does not write what punishment should be imposed. The gallows next to it is the only explanation. There is only one penalty hanging here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the relationship between such a powerful law. Everything in the city of Oufu is well organized. Although there are animals everywhere, there is no violent and barbaric taste. Most of these Asians are busy doing their own things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a real city. In addition to casinos such as pub casinos, there are also almost all human societies here. The most surprising thing is the feeling of civilization here. In addition to the lizards, the orcs actually say simple human languages ​​and some can read. Among the half-orcs, the close relatives of these big-eared monsters have almost no difficulty in contacting them with intelligence and human beings. Many of the affairs in the city are also taking care of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed an amazing order. In the past experience, the beasts were completely synonymous with barbarism and uncivilization. Everything seen here makes people feel that they are more suitable to use the more academic words to call ‘sub-humans’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that all the crimes committed in such a good order are difficult to carry out. It was very unexpected that the old thieves went to contact with the big-eared geeks and learned that the goods had all been collected by the orcs. It is said that it is the right of the big-eared monsters to be separated into a single-family settlement. And the orcs don't seem to be going to sell them to them. The news immediately exploded in the thief group. They are now stuck here for a few days now. The thieves are not willing to empty hands but they don’t know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa himself is not very worried. He is not far from the book now. He wants to come to the orcs and never put those goods in their lives for a lifetime. His current mood is not tense at all or he is not nervous at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;小懿 is the most active and happy of their group. It is because of what she started to play. At the beginning, I was very careful to only inquire about the situation with other businessmen and dwarves in the hotel and then simply took Asa and went around the city. She took a book and a pen from time to time to write down and draw down the strange things I saw. However, because of this, Asa also had a good understanding of the basic situation of this city-state. Asa’s habitual ability has always been strong, and Xiaoyan always pulls him around and stays here for a few days. It feels like it’s the same peace in an exotic tour. It’s just a little troublesome. Even if he always sleeps on the floor or on a chair, he still has to force him to take a bath every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just after coming back from the outside, I was about to go out to eat outside the door and suddenly heard the voice of the old thief. "Get out of the way"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa and Otaru walked out to see that almost all the thieves were running out with Fodo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Asa quickly followed up with the Buddha. In the past few days, Fodoro has been working hard to negotiate with the orcs about the goods, but it seems that nothing has progressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The night when the one-eyed dragon was going to store the goods to steal something, it was caught," said Fodo. The one-eyed dragon is a night thief in their group. It is said that he has been to the palace to steal things. "I have already told him not to act rashly, but the guy didn't know where to know that there was a jewel in the goods, so he sneaked into it at night and prepared to steal it. In the big warehouse, there were two werewolves guarding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wolfman?" Asa was shocked by a cold sweat. I remembered that the life and death of the werewolf in the lizard swamp and the werewolf six years ago was indeed no more powerful than the hunter's facial features, and their combat power was ten times stronger than that of ordinary humans. If you are also stealing and stealing, there is probably nothing to end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the one-eyed dragon"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Changed." Fodor is very easy Say the word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same huge gallows stand next to the three huge stone monuments in the center of the city. The combination of strips of stone and wood, tall and solid, and the stone carvings of the law, stand together to show the majesty of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of orcs are already onlookers. The two werewolves were the ones who were led by the occupant's one-eyed dragon. The eyes of the one-eyed dragon were stuffed with a black cloth in the mouth but it was heard that he was still struggling with the hands and feet that were screaming but was only in vain in the hands of the two werewolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leading human being is an ordinary middle-aged man. Standing in front of the gallows, he began to announce loudly that the Cyclops had attempted to steal and injure the guards last night and said that the fact had been confirmed by the notary and then he turned to read the statutory provisions on the prohibition of theft. After reading it, he signaled the two werewolves to carry the one-eyed dragon to the gallows and put the rope with the thick arms on the neck of the one-eyed dragon. In this process, the Cyclops have been trying to struggle in vain to make a sound in their mouths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader walked to the gallows and pulled a board of the unicorns at the foot of the organ to split the person and immediately fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the rope, a slight squeaking sound came from under the taut. When the two werewolves walked down and untied the one-eyed dragon, he was just a quiet body. The drop was immediately cut off at the end of his cervical spine and he was very clean and neatly opposed to his tweaking struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs around the onlookers have no special reflections and are far less excited than the audience watching the prisoners in human society, but they are arguing and leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa felt his arm twisted and turned his head and looked at him. His face was slightly white and he looked at the body of the one-eyed dragon that was being moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always went back to the hotel room and sat down on the simple bed. He kept his hand on his shoulder. Her face was slightly white and her lower lip was bitten slightly to reveal a few white teeth. The frowning and slender eyes of the brows have always seemed to be violently looking at something but showing confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first time I saw someone killed?" Asa asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Xiaoyan shook his head and shook his head. Asa’s shoulders could feel the stiffness of her movements. "The first person who saw the acquaintance was killed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cyclops are the best thieves in the relationship between them and they often come and chat with the two from time to time. I will say some weird jokes with Asa. When Xiao Xiao is next to him, he will always laugh out loud and very proudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa also felt a little unconsciously slammed his head and leaned his face against her head. Xiao Yan’s body moved but still kept his original body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
