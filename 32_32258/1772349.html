			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is silent, everyone can see how horrible these two are, but the Pope is very understated to raise his hand and say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazingly, Asa. He used to use the amazing momentum of the two Necromancers to distract the people around him, and then wait for the opportunity to move, but he did not move, Lancelot and the three Knights of the Temple did not I looked at it over there and their attention was focused on him. It is already him who is surprised and distracted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not white magic, even if you can really settle the Necromancer, you can’t let the already fast figure lose its inertia and rest completely. Just the Pope. At the same time as the export is low, Asa can feel something moving around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing specific about him, but the keen sense of meditation can be clearly understood, and the power to stop the Necromancer is not From the pope, but something bigger and more ubiquitous around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Asa suddenly saw the Pope’s fingers. On the finger, it is a ring that looks familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plain color and look, there is no extra shape, just a ring that looks very ordinary, there is a small piece of rubbing mark. Asa saw it very clearly. This is indeed the ring that was originally set on the dark star. He has been carrying it. It is said to be the ring left by the last Pope Deken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others may not be aware of it, but the true meditation of a keen sense can make Asa see that the source of the strange feeling around it seems to be in this Above the ring. As the Pope raises his hand and makes a sound, there is a strange feeling that emanate from the ring and then scatters into the surrounding air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the king's ring, the last time Pope Deken used to create something that can compete with the power of the Dark Star, You don't have to expect what kind of tricks you can play." The Pope also saw Asa's gaze at the ring, faintly said. "In this case, it doesn't take much effort to catch you. I see you give me a chance to be part of your elders. I will say it again, and I will surrender."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are elite swordsmen, hundreds of magicians. Asa stood in the middle with such a bare hand, and there seems to be no such extraordinary momentum and deterrent, but every person surrounded here is a master. They all have the instincts of the master, as long as the person in the middle is not surrendering himself. , disarming, shackling, then no matter who wants to kneel down, he will certainly pay a considerable price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa snorted. Say: "Don't use that thing to scare me. I took the ring longer than you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Is that true?" Pope The eyebrows are slightly raised, and it seems a bit unexpected. "It's a pity that the time you bring is no longer useful. It was originally the ring that only the owner of the Glorious Castle can use. The ring of the king is not something that you can understand the word "king"."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like the demonstration, the Pope raised his hand slightly toward Asa. But Asa did not feel that the old man was raising his hand in front of him, but the entire shining castle stood up like a huge giant, and looked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can quietly lurk in, have to say that I am looking down on you. But as long as you are in the Glorious Castle, you can't hide from me. Feeling of the land. I would also like to thank you this time. By the way, let us find out what we have always wanted to find out..." With the voice of the pope. The strange fluctuations around it are getting heavier and heavier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa knew at this time why he was discovered, why he was tracked and ambushed and was completely unaware. Until now, I noticed the ring and noticed the fluctuations in the ring. He discovered that the fluctuation was always filled in the glorious castle, like the air is omnipresent. This fluctuation is very weak, it seems that it is not magical power, and it is so weak that he can hardly feel it. It seems to be only the illusion that occurs after excessive concentration. However, Asa can be sure that this is not just the power that has suddenly stopped the two Necromancers. It is also the power that has just stopped the transmission of Ai Mei's hand, so that he can not detect the surrounding situation at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This power is subtle, but the effect is incredibly powerful. Asa knows that he really can't resist this power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice does not seem to be the voice of the pope, but it seems to be the surrounding buildings, the ground, the sky, all in this big drink, stop. And what followed was the tremendous pressure to fill the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although others can’t feel it, but Asa knows very well that the majesty and momentum of the entire Glorious Castle are suddenly pressing around him, condensing, and then transforming into Unstoppable substantial power. This is the power that has just let the two dead bodies live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A screaming violently opened in this majestic voice, Asa’s vindictiveness suddenly jerked, and he used all his strength to counter this power. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as the Pope said, no matter how big a person is, it’s impossible to accept the admiration and worship of countless believers in the hundreds of years with the Glorious Castle. The mental energy produced is contrary. Asa’s vindictive light was completely extinguished when it was just lit up. Even his anger was drowned in the reverberation of the Pope’s voice. He was as rigid as Rhodehart and Helicika, falling down. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope’s face did not relax at all, but it was stretched like a slate. It was the moment of violent temper, Asa also won a moment of opportunity, just enough for him to throw out the thing that was pulled out of his waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a red crystal, just as it flies out of Asa’s hand, it seems to burn like a fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal does not burn, it is the magic power. An eccentric and majestic grandeur rushes out of the crystal as the magical power burns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people surrounded are all masters. Although the filial piety did not have time to make a sound, but only to see this thing was thrown out to feel this momentum, all the hands-on people immediately started. They all feel that this should be something like a magic scroll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of high-level priests are beginning to mourn white magic at the same time, they are all used to purify the spell. The anger-like white magical power surged, and the burning crystal was wrapped tightly at the same time. At the same time, the Welsh Kay in the Knights of the Temple also mentioned the golden battle in the hand, a broken magic that is also composed of crystal. The arrow spurred out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical flame on the crystal is really extinguished. The purification of hundreds of high-ranking priests, even if it is a curse scroll, can also use this huge white magic to dispel the magic of it used to purify other magic structures. But the exclamation sounded at the same time among the priests. Although the flame was extinguished, the eccentric momentum did not weaken at all. Instead, it passed through the white magic package with a more violent path, covering the entire territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slamming sound, Wellskey’s crystal smashed magic arrow hits the crystal still in the air, breaking the magic arrow Smashed, but the crystal did not have the slightest operation, but was bombarded by the impact of this arrow. The power of this arrow is great, and the crystal is flying high. Everyone’s gaze flew up the sky with the crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bang of the muffled sound, the flame that had just been extinguished was re-burned in a thousand times thousands of times, and it was instantly on the top of the crowd. The sky formed a huge flame of sea, shining the night like a white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than the flame is the kind of momentum, the entire shining castle is enveloped in this momentum, and everyone under this momentum can feel Shock and fear are not fears of magic, but fears of a greater majesty than yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames of the ocean did not fall, but floated in the air. It seems that a figure in the flame is rapidly changing from small to large, and the flame ocean changes shape. When the figure in this flame grows into a huge bird shape that is tens of meters long, the flame is also condensed and covered on it. The flamingo flutters and the burning heat waves blow down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a phoenix!" Countless people are shouting and screaming. This is the only beast that is only seen in myths and legends. The entire sky became a red and yellow flame under the flame of the god bird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to this flaming red sky, the face of the pope and everyone is iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a resounding whistle, and the phoenix flew around the sky with a flame, and then swooped toward the shining castle below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
