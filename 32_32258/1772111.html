			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than half a year ago, the mysterious pagan killed the imperial minister, a felling team at the timber farm in Airy suddenly looked for good wood. There is a strange forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an old tree in the old woods. It is an old tree that needs dozens of people to hold together. The felling squad is most experienced. An old lumberjack immediately went to chop a few axes and looked at the material of these ancient trees. It’s surprisingly good. He’s never seen such a good wood in his decades of dismembering countless trees. He once admire the wood where it is as delicate and aura as human flesh. Such a wood can definitely sell high prices, so the value of a forest that is still unsatisfactory is no less than a huge gold mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this forest is indeed revealing that there are almost no birds, insects and ants in the weirdness. It seems to be unusually silent. If there is no horror atmosphere, let everyone There was a bit of trepidation and they only dared to explore the depths of the silence. However, due to the excitement of such a treasure land, they have left a few people to camp on the edge of the forest to stay behind and report to others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodyard owners saw the wood fragments brought back and immediately excited to leave and see for themselves. They did not see the left-behind workers on the edge of the forest and even the tree that left them with signs of cutting down could not be found. The dark woods no matter how they yelled and no one responded until someone smelled the bloody smell from the feet and took out the fire candle and took care of the traces of these colleagues. They have been crushed by something and flattened and broken. The deformed body is pressed so tightly that it is pressed like a bean dregs. So when people step on it, there will be a solid touch on the ground without feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This horrible scene immediately caused confusion. But after a flustered for a while, it seems that I can't find out what is going on. No one is willing to explore the depths of this forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a horse riding around the woods and the forest was very huge. So some people thought it was incredible: such a huge forest has never seemed to be possible before, and the bodies of the workers are even more scented by the strange and quiet forest. Everyone feels it. But no matter how many countless trees that can be exchanged for gold coins, there is no doubt about it. Temporarily let go of the fear wood owners began to be excited about this huge wood production. The mysterious danger of illusion is immediately insignificant in the immediate control of the interests at hand. What's more, they didn't need to do it themselves, so a large number of workers under the command of the timber farmer came to the edge of this new place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first few days, many high-quality woods were cut down and the high-quality wood was immediately sold on the market. Unexpectedly high prices were sold. The high price of the power allowed the owners to order workers to set up camps and tools in the woods to prepare to cut down trees day and night. But one day the people outside the forest heard a strange noise and screams coming out and waited for the outsiders to gather enough courage and number to go in. Now all the people in the room are now and those who stayed in the past few days. The workers turned into a flat body like a rat that had been crushed by wheels for countless times on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news came out and attracted the local elderly. They said that this previously undiscovered forest really exists. According to ancient legends, there is a forest in this forest. The only person who is offensive to God is to die like this. The eccentric rumors came from the mouth of the old man and it seemed to have a deterrent to match the hundreds of lives. No matter how the timber owners urged and ordered, no workers dared to enter the woods. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if Shenwei can shock civilians, it’s hard to scare away the temptation of wealthy gold coins that have a thirst for gold coins. Few illusory legends can compete. The woodland owners firmly believe that there are strange strange beasts lurking in this forest. So they gathered a team of people with many magicians to enter the depths of the forest to prepare to break these vulgar superstitions with tangible exploration spirit. However, this extraordinary courage did not get the expected effect. Those who entered the depths of the forest did not come back and were quietly swallowed by this mysterious forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strange place has caught the attention of people who are not convinced of the church and are seeking new beliefs. This forest will feel a kind of look at a glance. The trait of convincing is in line with the taste of these mystics. They set up a pagan church called ‘the god of nature’ to imitate the ancient legends of the Druids who want to worship nature and nature. With the mysterious and strange charm of this forest for a while, the number of this group has risen. Even small pagan groups have come to admire their doctrines and turn them into the majesty of this truly stunning forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turning point more than a month ago, the local army and the church assembled nearly a thousand troops to disperse the pagans and stationed on the grass outside the forest to prepare to completely remove the pagan forests and kill the beasts. But the devotees of the ‘natural god’ who rebelled the next day were now left with only a ruined body and dozens of huge stone statues that had never been seen before standing on the grass outside the forest. Each of these stone statues has a semi-circular shape forming a semi-circular fan shape toward the forest every tens of meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strange thing is regarded as a miracle by the 'God of Nature'. The huge stone statues are undoubtedly their gods created by the power of the gods to protect the forest. They use this as a reason to show that the God they believe in does exist and is more powerful than the God of the church. The living facts are always more persuasive than any deep and wise theological and philosophical doctrines. Since then, the number and power of the 'God of Nature' has now surged to almost four or five thousand. Deservedly the most serious pagan disaster in the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Four or fifty thousand?" Asa heard the words of the local official and immediately stunned Rod Hart also ate a small surprise. Although they were not in the right situation when they came, they did not expect it to be like this. It is important to know that even the entire population of the Airy area is only seven or eighty thousand. It can almost be said that the entire area of ​​Airy has become the territory of the ‘natural god’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local officials bitterly screamed: "There is no way, when I sent the emergency to the king, there were not so many, the pagans increased this month. It’s not as fast as the local villagers, but there are still a lot of people coming from outside.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This local official who was succeeded after being killed is a thin man. This is a rare exception among officials. His face-lifted wrinkles have become a bitter gourd. "The two adults have really tried their best. You have also seen this is a cathedral built with huge sums of money. But the people are not convinced of our God. I can also strictly control those differences when I first started. The people who teach the tendency but the number of pagans have been dozens of times more than the strength of the city. They threatened me to let me put those people. Finally, I only used all the troops to defend the pagans. I was only addicted to their own ghosts and did not want to come to the siege. But they first smashed the lumber yard and occupied a lot of villages, threatening me to release the city hall. Now almost the entire production and work of Airy It’s all paused.” Probably thinking that my own journey will probably be because of these misfortunes. His bitter gourd is more and more bitter. "The two adults please think about it. I really have tried my best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is far worse than the imagination. The two people are gloomy and go out. church. The troops are stationed outside the city for the convenience of action because there are some words that cannot be made known to them without any accompanying agents. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This church is the former Asa on the construction of the unlucky local official fat pig road that was turned into a corpse by Vedinina. When I came back, I just finished half of the work behind it and it was done under the hands of the bitter gourd. This is a magnificent and magnificent church that is not much smaller than the Cathedral of the Magic Academy. It is still indispensable, but it is obvious that it will not receive any practical effect. In the current situation, it has been lost to the bitter melon local government officer. Office space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa shook his head and sighed and said: "It’s better to save money for this kind of silver coin than to spend so much money to repair such a useless thing. Raise the god. I believe that the believer of the god of nature will never be much more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhart asked: "Bishop Ronis said that you are against the forest. The situation should be very familiar with why so many pagans are gathered?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what is going on." Asa shook her head. From the words of the local officials, the workers who died in the whispers of Mori looked like the hands of the dead wood guards. But he only sees this. As for the shock of the Sun Well Enchantment, which could have been awesome and dare not face up or even dare to recall, how the inexplicable stone statues are going on. He can't understand these things. I thought about Asa’s decision: “Let’s go find someone who has seen it before and ask.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lumber yard outside the city has been 'natural The gods of God's were split into pieces and the two came to the office of the lumber yard in the city. Several timber owners heard that the imperial minister had drove to meet Rod Hart and asked the timber owners to ask the workers who had witnessed these things at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timber field owners naturally followed suit and said that their big boss behind the scenes just came from Wangdu to ask him to come out and meet with the two imperial ministers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhart replied: "These are just the following small leaders. The wood industry in Airy is almost entirely under the name of the Elni family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the wood The scene of the crowd surrounded the behind-the-scenes figure came out. Asa and Rod Hart suddenly both looked at each other with a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This big boss behind the scenes does not have the wealth and kindness that is unique to the merchant. Leng Jun’s face is as serious as it seems to be with a smothering tall and straight posture, and he is used to the condescending pressure of the condescending. The wood field owners next to him also feel uncomfortable. He looked coldly at the two imperial ministers without showing a little respect and surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Captain Kravis can't think of meeting you here." Rodhart smiled and nodded at him. "I don't know what's going on here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis sat down on the opposite chair and replied coldly: "This is my family's industry." If you look after it, you don't have to worry about it. You can do it if you want to do something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Rodhart still smiled very kindly. A bit. Naturally, I made a slight gesture to Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big industry is definitely not looking after the deputy of the Duke of the Paladin. There is no doubt that Clovis has another purpose here. As for what is the purpose, although it is not clear, it is just that it will not help the two of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timber field owners have brought together a total of more than a dozen people who have experienced the strange things that have been left in the city. They lined up in a row listening to a timber field owner saying, "You have listened to these two imperial adults want to know that your days are in the damn forest. You have to say all the details." Come out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a prominent voice in the "Yes" and "Know" voices. Those who speak loudly are undoubtedly surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone looks at this screaming person. This is a lean little man who can't see a trace of fat but seems to be able to squeeze out the iron-like skin. The black-headed head is wrapped in a weeping scarf with a little goatee. He didn't care about the eyes of everyone, but he looked at the two imperial adults as if they saw the most eccentric animals in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa only thought that this person was very familiar with it and remembered that he was the head hunter of the folks who remained in Rod Hart. . I just couldn't think of him returning to Airy and working as a worker at the Elni family's lumber yard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression on Rodhart’s face must have been amazed, but when Asa turned to look at him, he stood up and walked over and took this. The long-lost fellow countryman said: "This worker's big brother looks familiar. Oh, we are fellows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can you" Hunter Lai The text still squinted and did not slow down. He was even more imaginative than Rod Hart, who would meet them here and the two actually became imperial ministers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have a lot of things to ask you to ask us to tell us." Rodhart held the hunter Levin's hand and tightened his face with no smile. Variety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah. Ah. Oh. Good." The hunter seemed to finally understand Rodhart’s suggestion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis still has a cold face and no expression, just like a flash of light in his eyes. Asa saw it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the workers’ story, Rodhart signaled that Asa was ready to leave. He suddenly said what he wanted to say to the hunter: "This fellow also wants to go back with us. I still have a lot of things to ask you alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "No." Cloves, who had been there as if he hadn’t heard the same statue, suddenly spoke. His voice is even colder than his expression. "He is the person who belongs to our lumber yard during the validity period of the helper agreement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to..." Rodhart still smiles and is very kind. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't think anything, I can't say no." Clovis's attitude is still as cold as a stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
