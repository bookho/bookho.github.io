			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have been from the very beginning..." Master Eden’s face outside the mask is completely blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone from each other has been thinking about each other's life from the very beginning. It's just that your mind is not hot enough." The masked Necromancer played a stiff lark on the hand and it was just taken out of the robe. He looked at the master of Aiden and said, "It’s that you can’t think of the throne of the tower master for so many years. It’s hard to get rid of your feelings. It’s rare that the necromancer actually used the reel to attack the face. I have to admit that I am not as good as you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Lark is not moving and seems to be a specimen but Aiden knows that as long as the other party is willing to It can be the same weapon as the one just killed. Aiden knows that this sparrow is the same as the sparrow that first smashed his thunderous bombs and the birds that sneaked on them three times. But he really couldn’t think of how the other party would prepare so many strange weapons. And he has to admit that this is indeed the most powerful thing to seduce the power of corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was indeed from the beginning or even earlier that the other party made up the idea of ​​this sneak attack. The three birds had already flown to the distant corners of their own three eyes before the three of them noticed him, and they were self-righteous, but they knew that it was just a dangerous and dangerous oriole. . I think that the opportunity to shoot is also the opportunity that the other party has been waiting for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How? Still want to continue to try?" The golden mask is not in a hurry to shoot. It is already him who has the upper hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer who lost a whole arm, although he could barely stand, but the cold sweat on his head has already shown that he has almost no fighting power. Both of them are not good at white magic. Now the broken arm can only temporarily seal the wound with water magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aiden’s master sighed: “Just I really can’t think of your identity and combat power, but I’m thinking about sneak attack at the beginning.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Nonsense. How do you feel that people who have the status of fighting can naturally be graceful? But unfortunately I have never been a man of grace. Have you forgotten?" The golden mask was smashed. A mouthful of water. "Actually, I don't want to kill this fat man. I saw him as if he was not pleasing to the eye 20 years ago. I dare to rob me of a woman... I can't think of it until I almost forget it after twenty years. It’s really weird to think of it. Without the copper-smelling guy, the air of the Descartes Valley will always be much fresher. As for you, I don’t really want to kill you, but if you shoot, you will definitely go all out and you are not dead. It’s your own luck and strength. Let’s roll now.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Aiden picked up the relics of Nopolino. After the delivery reel was just pulled out, the golden skull mask suddenly shouted: "Wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aiden's action. Look at the golden skull mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I actually forgot to ask you this question. How do you think about it to kill the two people below?" The golden mask looks at the two characters. Asked a bit. "Although I believe no one can order you, but I believe that this is not your own meaning to give me an answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry. This is inside the guild. Even if I am willing to answer you know that I can't answer." Aiden replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of eyes under the golden skull mask burst out of the cold but immediately dimmed. "Yeah, I am not a guild. You can't tell me the news in the guild according to the rules. Then... I ask you only need to answer yes or no. You are here and the new one is called Jia. Is the Red Cardinal Cardinal kid concerned?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aiden silently nodded and answered, "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. I told him to stop fighting this kid." The golden mask was cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thanks to a message." Aiden thought of what he said. "Although I can't say it too clearly, I can tell you that this kid is very close to the acting president. Maybe there is something he can say here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Proxy president? Who? I know that Shante is not interested in this... is it after I left with Ai Greiner?" The golden mask was so surprised and thought about it thoughtfully. Suddenly sat up and closed my eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the four shadows of his gestures appearing in the following four directions, he flew here and came to the ground and landed on the back of the eagle. These are the two crows and the two owls staring at each other with a pair of eyes. Some of them lurk in the trees and fly out in the cracks of the ground under the gesture of the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the biggest change in the face of these four little things is the master of Aiden. He was a little angry and chilling: "This guy actually dared to monitor us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 43rd Acting President of Deya Valley did not see the predecessors. Ask a question?" The golden skull mask grabbed a crow and placed it in front of himself to look at the bird's eyes. "I don't think you are the acting guild president who is still willing to waste his magical power to practice the eagle eye..." He turned to look at Aiden. "This guy's heart is sure to be deep and heavy. It seems that you have been played."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Master Eden became a bit weird but didn't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I am no longer a member of the Necromancer. But I still don't allow anyone to come in the whistle valley. I warn you if you put it inside again." It’s your role model to make a smoldering fat man.” The golden 骷髅 mask said that the four swift-headed birds flew forward and began to smash and melt into a burst of black smoke. Did not stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a room in the faraway valley. The four crystal balls placed on the table were extinguished at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that there’s no one in this room. The expression of the golden skull mask in the crystal ball is white. The owner here just saw him. I have already left in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the gaze of the gargoyle, the gaze of the gargoyle escaping from the golden scorpion mask is not full of joy but full of sorrow. He looked at the emperor and Roland on the ground and did not pay attention to them but took out a transfer reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue transmission light continues to shine as the reel unfolds. The Necromancer seems to be somewhat ecstatic. He did not notice that he was in the situation. It’s strange that something is wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transmission of light is generally stable and transparent, but now the light around the Necromancer is a bit opaque. And it is still flashing slightly. This flicker is more intense and more intense as the transmitted light is brighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, some of the fascinating necromancers were unusual in their own weeks. When he noticed the change of the light, he first saw it and then it seemed that the old god had become a horror and panic in the moment of a leisurely expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The idiot..." He screamed abruptly and rushed to the side with his disproportionate reflection and explosiveness. He wants to use his own movement to eliminate the transfer magic that has been activated in the week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is already late. His previous excitement and the movement of this magic is much faster than the ordinary. His body shape has just moved, and this dazzling blue light has exploded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment. The blue light transmitted in the air seemed to be a small sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is by no means the effect of sending magic. The eagle, carrying the Necromancer, also shattered in the blasted blue light to become a dead body. Not only after its blue light, but also a large distance from the blue light, the living corpse suddenly and powerlessly fell to the ground and began to slowly disintegrate in the air as the sky full of blood and turbid rain And next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Impossible... How can Mr. Sandro... What is going on?" The face of Colonel Roland’s face was full of horror And an incredible look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time in the Magic Academy, the room that rotated the magic circle was also flashing a blue light. The eye of the star that is the center of the magical array is gently broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goodbye. Dear Sandron Senior. I will leave your name forever on the walls of the Deya Valley Conference Hall." The Marquis is cold Gazing at the transmission magic array on the ground. The blue light between the magic gems is still flashing intermittently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This transfer magic array is now completely different. The order of the magic stones or the number of stones is completely different from the previous ones. To be precise, this is not even a magical array that sends magical arrays but lets people who are supposed to be delivered here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
