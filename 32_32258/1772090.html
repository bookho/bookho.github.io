			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general went out to distract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day after Asa’s refusal, he temporarily entrusted the affairs of the troops to Asa and said that he would go out and let go. Originally, Asa was worried that he would go out of control and do something messy. He finally breathed a sigh of relief but seemed to feel that something was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because after that night, the expression on the face of the general was calm and there was no trace of the passionate emotions of yesterday, even the usual majesty and suffocation were gone. It reveals that an old man should be flat and steady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strong emotional contrast appears in such an old man. In the face of the murderous anger of the generals, Asa was not afraid but now he looked at the calm and calm face, but he always felt a little creepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who is out of control when he is out of control is not a big deal. The loss of control will only drown out the reason and it is not difficult to deal with. It is the most terrible when all the emotional powers are converged into the heart and all impulses are returned to calm and integrated into reason and personality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the truth is that the situation is indeed stable. Asa has already told the content of the imperial edict that every general in the army, even if it is forced to mobilize troops, is impossible. Perhaps that kind of calm is finally accepting the indifference of reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope so. Asa uneasily waited in Bracada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three days later the general finally came back and he brought more than twenty people. These people seem to be ordinary villagers, some of whom are old and young, and young and strong. After the generals placed them in the city hall, they called the small and medium-sized generals in the army and told them to quietly tell them something. Many of the generals are generals of the generals who have been in the military for decades. They can still mobilize them. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the general has set up a large and abundant banquet. All the pastors in the consolation force are of course included. This banquet is in full compliance with the strict requirements of the church for the diet of the pastors, but also the rich generals. The adults said that they would like to thank the pastors for their long-term guidance to the soldiers. Please enjoy them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the etiquette, it is very troublesome for the priests to eat. They must pray first and then slowly chew them slowly and then pray before they leave the table. Although this cumbersome rule does not necessarily mean that everyone is honestly observing, but in the hundreds of peers, there are also priests and gods who are naturally sloppy. So hundreds of pastors pray together as if they are a great The big sacrifices then start eating again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell are you doing?" The chiefs of the hundreds of pastors did not pray. He sat on the top seat and asked impatiently the general sitting next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general was very calm and smiled like a well-trained master: "Just want to invite you to have a good meal. I can’t help but not The priests' hands and feet are in the food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed a little helplessly and said: "I am asking you to help the elderly, don't do anything more." Quietly waiting here for the Duke of Mulak to come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general did not say anything but just quietly smiled. Asa looked at the back and only felt cold. This face is usually full of a variety of strong expressions. Now suddenly it is very gentle and it looks very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you eat the gods?" The general smiled and pointed to the deliciousness on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa shook his head and sighed and dragged a plate of food to his mouth and said vaguely: "Of course, eat others, why not eat? I have never "There is no hatred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The food is very delicious. The priests are very graceful and gentle in the following. Occasionally, some people look up to see their sir. But there is a sea otter like a bandit, but I dare not imitate it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plate in front of Asa was already empty. He seemed to be satisfied with a full hand and stood up and walked outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General asked: "Where is the official?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streets of Bracada are very deserted or there are no soldiers walking around the street at noon, which seems a bit strangely deserted. Asa walked around and he wanted to see what the general was going to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa heard the voice inside when passing through a hotel. He walked over to the door and quietly looked inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the halls unique to the Brakada Hostel can accommodate such two or three hundred soldiers sitting together. These are very young soldiers of more than ten or twenty years old. It is not obvious that older veterans are deliberately drawn from the troops. They are listening to the old man very carefully around an old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old man is brought back by the generals. One of those people has a very simple face. The ditch is half-slung and his hands are drooping fast to the knee. The typical face is facing the loess. The old farmer who spent his life in the middle of the sky. Now he is talking to the soldiers: "I saw a human skin hanging on the tree without a face but I know who it is. I recognize the scar on my leg. I personally gave this scar to the wound. This time The ogres have already danced my sister to the ogres dressed as a priest on the stone platform, and then cut the stomach of my sister with a knife made of stone. The sister has been calling for a few foods. The demons pressed her. I watched my sister's blood flow all the way to the stone platform. She was always clamoring for the priest to dig her heart out and hold it in her hand and hold the dance that jumped up. Put it on their altar. That is my sister." The tears of the old man came out and the body was not slashing the power of this memory for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young soldiers began to stir up their blood in their bodies has begun to boil and the grief of the enemy is rubbing in their hearts, the younger leaks* The burning is more vigorous. If there is an orc now in their field of vision, it will definitely be torn by the angry people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, this time the people in the village invited a group of mercenaries. I ran out of this chaotic time. But what happened to the scene that I saw with my own eyes? I can’t forget it. Every year in our village, people are caught and eaten by the beasts until the generals lead the troops to come here to kill all those damn beasts. We really thank the generals, General Saunders. The great benefactors of our people are the greatest generals of the empire." The old man continued to scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of these two hundred and three young listeners has completely resonated with this old man. The young heart is always particularly easy to be moved. What happened is that it is impossible for a person who is slightly bloody to be unmoved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I have heard that the general has been dismissed. Although my old man does not understand any national events, I only know that the generals are the benefactors of our people and the warriors of you. The same is true for the people of Limin people to fight. But those who are officials and those nobles just use our hard-earned money to eat, drink and play. Why they can make General Sanders such a good man dismissed." Old farmers use simple logic to express their simple feelings. "I have also heard that the remnants of the orcs have already established a city in the wasteland and they have colluded with the nobles to sign a peace treaty with the empire and to admit their independence. Is there any reason? Is it true that our dead relatives? Didn't I sleep well one night after I heard this news? I only hate that I am too old to wave my sword. Otherwise, even if I am alone, I will kill the orc city even if I am dead. When the beasts are eaten, I have to use a knife to cut them and use my flesh to poison them. "The voice and body of the old man are more excited and more trembling." This is not a pre-prepared speech. There is no practice to let such a simple person say such powerful words. It is the expression of true emotions that shocks the hearts of every listener. These soldiers are very young and very simple. They can fully feel the power of these emotions. The expressions on their faces are covered up by fanatic anger and leaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa could still hear a layer of goose bumps at the door. He probably guessed what the general would do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s time for everyone to go. The general has something to say to us." One of the soldiers’ captains led the soldiers to stand up. Going outside, Asa quickly let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of soldiers began to walk out of the various hotels and were young soldiers. They were all in batches to listen to those who were recruited by the generals. The speech. There are no other generals who come out to interfere with their general's prestige in the subordinates. It is not just a documentary document that can be expelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers did not care about Asa. They walked outside the city under the leadership of some soldiers who had probably accepted the military instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for all the soldiers to gather, the general began to shout at the angry and angry young people with a loud voice: "The great warriors of the men's empire of Ian Fast. Everyone already knows that I am no longer a force. The commander. Because of the conspiracy of the nobles, the trade of dirty political interests, the great war that originally avenged our people, has already died. I tell you that I can go back and take the court’s slogan. I enjoy the old age because I am not a general. But I will not do this. Absolutely not." The general is roaring. "Because I am still a warrior" he seems to be roaring with his life. "I am a warrior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers subconsciously shouted at this majestic scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every truly heartfelt cry will arouse the shock of others. What's more, this shock is as early as the drama of the **, there are already enough stories and performances to be paved before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing on the edge of the soldier array, listening to the scream of anger, Asa felt cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't go back to enjoy my old age. I would rather use all the time that I am old on the sickbed in exchange for the opportunity to make me a warrior. The identity uses a sword to tell the beasts of our human dignity and anger. The general voice of the general is clearly communicated to the ears of every soldier. "I can't order you now. I can't command you anymore. I am just talking to you as a warrior as a warrior." The general slowed down and the voice aggravated the tone to ensure the rolling sound. The fire in the hearts of every young soldier can be completely ignited. "My warrior is here to ask you. Are the soldiers like me, are you willing to follow me? Will you go with me to slaughter those beasts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Willing." The deafening sound burst in the mouth of the soldiers. This is five or six thousand roars from the lungs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, everyone goes back to clean up your clothes as I said." The successful speaker ordered the excited audience below. "We will be out right away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers quickly dispersed in an organized way. Soon there are only two people, Asa and the general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general did not move on the hills. The performance of the leaking point did not leave any traces. He resumed the terrible calm expression and looked down like the same statue. Asa under the hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean by doing this." Asa asked coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general’s tone is as calm as his expression: “Just let them know the details of some things and then let them make their own choices. Everyone has the right to know the truth. It is not a bad thing to tell others the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa snorted and said: "You have put all the pastors Is it necessary to concentrate on this truth?” The role of the priests in the team, in addition to healing and assisting magic, is to grasp the emotions of the soldiers. Warriors who roll on the line of life and death are generally taught by very devout priests and some spiritually-assisted little magic is often helpful to the instigation of the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The faith was originally used to cover up the truth. It is the props of the weak self-deception. The warrior never needs this kind of thing. It only takes a little while to fully ignite. Their morals and the gods are not able to extinguish them." The general looked at Asa and finally showed a curious expression. "Since you understand what I am doing, why are you still standing here? I thought you must go back and arrange to stop me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have already done this, you must have other arrangements." Asa did not run back and went to the hill. "But I still have to ask if you immediately go back and ask the pastors to calm down the soldiers' emotions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As soon as you have this intention, I will immediately Killed you." The general was still so calm. No anger, no murderousness, and even a smile on the lips. But Asa knows that he can definitely do it if he says it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think you must grasp?" Asa stood in front of the general and looked at him coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not sure about it alone." The general admitted honestly that his vision as a martial artist was there. "But 5,000 people must have it. The 5,000 young soldiers who just listened to me just said that you are actually the spies of the aristocrats and orcs in the court and then stun them and they will kill you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a dead eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All his feelings are all dead on a goal, even his own life is just a prop to achieve that purpose. He can do everything with all the wisdom and energy to achieve that goal, even if it is to lose the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five thousand. All young soldiers." Asa slowly shook his head. "Is it you specially selected from the army?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it is young. Young people have a leak* before they have the blood to be impulsive. After a long time, I would like to think about something else that is not so willing to die and kill." The general looked at Asa with the already dead eyes. "So I advise you not to do extra things. I don't want to make any more twists and turns and you don't want to die." He turned and walked toward the city. "Under the circumstances, the pastors are no longer useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general led the 5,000 soldiers out of the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No other generals will stop the generals of their generals from making these past subordinates uncomfortable. The general's persuasion also made them understand that this is nothing but the general's willingness to do anything, even if there is anything to give birth to them will never be affected. They are not really standing out to stop the soldiers who were originally under them, without being tied up and not coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not stop him from letting the pastor to persuade the soldiers who were stunned by anger and fighting spirit. He didn’t want to see the priests of the Bishop of Ronis being The general broke into two halves. A general like a man has done everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is now only sitting in the town hall waiting for the arrival of the Duke of Mulak. Fortunately, the general has left the rest and there will be no more variables. The task given to him by Bishop Ronis is not completely successful but it is finally completed. The general only took away 5,000 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five thousand people. But one-eighth of this unit is nothing. The show has shown his range of abilities and he has tried his best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five thousand people. Asa suddenly remembered the three terrible bodies he saw when he first came here. Five thousand and two thousand times can accumulate as much as a mountain. The screams and wailing of the five thousand people at the same time will be the flesh and blood of the visceral bones. The ear rang again in his ear for more than half a year. The kind of ocean skeleton skeletal body that made his life unforgettable. The strange sound weapon of the deformation tears the concerto composed of the air and the tone of the meat intertwined and undulating and now has to be strengthened dozens of times. He feels that his skin is somewhat tightened and the stomach is somewhat contracted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa slammed up and kicked the table and smashed the chair. I used the swearing and cursing that I had learned from the pub in the pub before the generals, and the swearing and cursing of the sacred priests smashed the general and then went to find a very experienced and qualified priest to explain how to ride the horse to chase the general. The troops are gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" The general saw Asa chasing him up and asking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stunned the arrogant soldier and said, "Come and wait to see you die."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you will not be disappointed." The general said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that you die as soon as possible. You are the first to die at the beginning of the battle. Then I have the opportunity to bring the remaining soldiers back. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you may be disappointed again. I was not so easy to die before the slashing of the beasts was not soft." The general answered faintly. . Since the determination was made, all his feelings have converged into the body and turned into power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked at the burly old man who was taller than himself and the two axe between his waist and said, "If possible If I really want to finish this thing by hand, I don’t have to wait for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I was in the past, I would consider your suggestion." General I looked up and down and turned my head back to stare in front of the direction. "It's impossible now. It's a pity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a pity." The Necromancer is sitting on a velvet comfortable cushion. . "I failed." He just sent it back from the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
