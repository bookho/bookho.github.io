			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army of the night of Oufu finally began to attack the coalition forces outside the hundred miles. This is the first time that Oufu took the initiative but it will definitely let All human soldiers were most impressed with one attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals of the coalition are not the laymen who are ignorant of the war. They have been playing on the battlefield for so many years. Naturally, there will be natural arrangements and defenses. It’s all the experience of fighting between human forces. Oufu has no practical ability to go to the end of the orcs. The marching style of the orcs, the combat power, and so on. And the attack of such a long time is very easy to predict. Unilateral killings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the army is naturally the commander of Gru, who is the great Bolugan. Sedros himself did not stay with him in the empty city hall of Oufu. He and Asa only two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I remember well, I still owe you two months now." Asa lit the oil lamp on the wall, the red light was dazzling but here In the dark space, nothing can be reflected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two months and four days, that is, sixty days. There is no sixty days before the agreement between us is completed." Cedros softly added He lay in his chair with his eyes closed and his hands were slowly licking his own temple. The wrinkles that shine under the light show the tiredness and stagnation of an old man. The leader who was so spiritually so rich and juggling just thousands of people now looks like an empty pocket. It seems that even the loudest effort is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of unprocessed papers scattered on the table. The war will continue to maintain the normal operation of the Oufudi and a certain degree of exhibitions to make all available resources. How can humans arrange in the most reasonable way how to develop a system to operate Asa and clearly Cedros, the city owner is more busy than the ten usual leaders, not to mention things like leisure, even sleep every day. Physique in three or four hours or so Asa often suspects that such an old man has so much energy and so much perseverance to undertake such a huge work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong? Looking forward to hurry up and work well? I thought you and the black elf had a good time." Cedrus whispered I opened his eyes and gave him a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is nothing to do." Asa’s face could not help but be a little red. He was completely uninterested in managing things like the internals of Sedros. And Bolugan will not let him do this. So this time he and the black elf are the most leisurely people in Oufu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros smiled and said: "I will do something right away. You can rest assured that I have never used the habit of wasting things. So I will make good use of you for these 60 days. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to assassination? Or what conspiracy? Still want me to follow the big forces to chase the coalition forces<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sedros smiles: "You said that I am like a big and negative role in the story. And sighed weakly. "But after all. I seem to have been doing these things all the time. I never thought that one day I would personally order to kill tens of thousands of people<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember you also It has been said that war is the most boring means of solving things. It is foolish to use fighting to cultivate hatred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I still think so until now. "Cedros is still a weak smile. "But now, apart from these most boring and stupid methods, I really have no way. I didn't expect things to go so "" You wouldn't have thought of it?" Asa groaned. It may be possible to be born in other things or other people, but it is really impossible for someone like Sedros to spend a lifetime of hard work to build the city of Oufu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedrus sighed: "I should have thought that Ronis would have died in the establishment of Oufu. Sebastian and Deya Valley." Will not allow Oufu to exist. This is certain for a long time, but if there is his restraint in the church and the suppression of the Necromancer. This war is absolutely impossible. Just let Oufu have more than ten years of exhibition space. It’s Sebastian or Diya Valley that may not be enough. “<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Maybe.” Asa nodded and he saw Oufu with his own eyes. Step by step. In less than two years, the city has reached an amazing scale. The efficiency of the orcs under the orderly management of Cedros is really not comparable to human beings, as long as there is enough time for the population to replenish and growing up. Accumulating substances may really not be afraid of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also have eyeliner in Seyster?" Asa was a little surprised. Although he knew that Cedros’s eyeliner was a lot of Oufu’s advantage to the coalition forces, there was a smuggling of Oufu in the coalition, but there was no human spy among the orcs, but he also could not think of the glorious castle at the headquarters of the church. The orcs collect information from people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not surprising. No matter what the situation, people are always the easiest to buy, at least much easier than the orcs." Cedrus snorted softly. . "This is also the reason why I called you. I believe that Magnus will not be able to indiscriminately send someone who can't do anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Want me to kill this new cardinal? What kind of person is he?" Asa asked this question when she felt a little dumbfounded. If this is the case, then the crimes committed against the Church of Light will not be more than unprecedented. It is true that no matter how vicious or evil. They will not specifically seek the church's cardinal to assassinate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros had a strange expression on his face and said: "According to the report, the new cardinal called Javey was just a very young church. The warrior was dismissed for this position because of his outstanding achievements. This is very strange. No matter how good the merits are, he will not let Magnus deliver this heavy task to a young man who has entered the Glorious Castle for less than a year. One of the achievements of this Templar is that the Knights who once rescued the Temple Knight on the battlefield should be the one who saved the Knight of the Temple using the bow and arrow. Do you have an impression?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't see a group of elite swordsmen at the time. We came here to have damage in the previous battles, so I didn't dare to touch it but "Asa hesitated and didn't know why." In his mind, a figure appeared in the forest in Tula. There is no reason to say that the person is the new cardinal is just a strange simple intuition that he has adjusted this image from memory. "But what?" asked Cedrus. "Nothing I remembered wrong." Asa shook his head. After all, intuition could not be used as an inference. "Kill him?" "It’s good to kill nature. But I advise you to be careful. I don’t have any extra thoughts to investigate the things on this person. But this should not be easy to deal with. You better. First lurk back to the School of Magic and then act on the plane. "" Go back to Love Sturt?" Asa thought for a moment. A smile. "I just planned to go back and see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful with yourself, although this matter is important, but I and Gru have no more thoughts at that end. We can't help you with anything. "He paused. Sigh and say. "This may be the last mission I gave you, but as long as you finish the hand of Seyster and Deva Valley, you can't reach the Magic Academy. I'm still able to keep peace with Oufu, then I am here too." There is hope.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know. I am ready to leave now. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden burst of blue light outside the window that was particularly glaring in the dark nights. It was the light that sent the magical array.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical array in the midday flute valley lights up and appears in the valley.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a gorgeous middle-aged man I can see some tired colors, but he gives people the feeling that it is a kind of long-tidy clothes. The tidy clothes are glamorous and bright. The skin is white and delicate, and the wrinkles and hairs of the eyes seem to go through ten. The girl's elaborate dressing and carving.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you Lord Nopolit, it’s time to praise the great Akibad who must have summoned you back. I have to pay my attention to it and I will return to Sai Ster. I am not here alone. "The anxious Bishop of Adela has come from a distance. From his words, he can see his current mood.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Calm down. Dear Cardinal Akibad, you must not like to hear you put him behind the Lord. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Things are such a way that Javey was sent to Loves by Magnus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man was a bit ugly after listening to his face, but he immediately thought about it and said: "But it doesn't seem to be a big bad thing. Since the young man is so confident, he must have his reason. . Although I also think that he is unlikely to cope with Sandru and then bring the Magic Academy to the hand, it is self-protection that Sandru should be enough to respect the fact that he will not make such a fuss about the juniors. We should have confidence in the wisdom and confidence of young people. Jarvis’s mind can definitely deal with any problems in the land. Moreover, it is undoubtedly the safest way to go as a cardinal. Even those who are present will be scrupulous about this identity and not at ease. Do you think that in this subtle relationship, they just dared to let a cardinal appointed by the Pope to act in Lovefest because of doubt? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man shook his head and said: "It's a pity. It's not that you can't be separated. I can't help anyone. We can only rely on ourselves. I want to represent the president. I will think so because we may be right away. There will be more important things to do. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adra looked at the middle-aged man and said: "What do you mean?" "This time I went to Nepal." The harvest of the roots will definitely surprise you. "" Didn't he promise to use Erasia before dealing with Oufu?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not only that. Do you remember what you asked me to investigate? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's that"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't just ask the priest of Tima to find out this one. The most important thing is that the Tima High Priest also wants to join us in the Deva Valley to become a noble and graceful Necromancer. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Adela showed a very strange expression. "I'm afraid it's not suitable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can rest assured that the priest of Tema is either the magical skill of the summit or his The impeccable status in Nigen and his wise mind are impeccable and fully qualified to be accepted as a Necromancer to qualify for the sacred Dark Star. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the high priest should be one"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the Tamar priest joins Deva Valley You should be able to imagine how much influence this great dead guild would have. At that time even Saskatchewan would be under our power. "The light of the shining light in the eyes of middle-aged people is the unique light of a kind of businessman. It is the reflection of the golden gold coins or the great benefits of the sky.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adra frowns and shakes his head gently. Although it can't be said that this is a bad thing, but I feel that kind of vision does not match a necromancer: "Although I don't agree, I still wait for Haha. I am coming back to hold a meeting to decide. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oufu is going north and north. A large piece of endless green is fluttering in the wind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This It was originally a scene that was totally incompatible with the wilderness. In this season, only the toughest and most tenacious plants can grow on the land of the highland ridges. But these are the crops that should have been planted in the warm and humid south and these crops. The growth momentum is ten times more powerful than the bathing in the fertile fields of spring rain and rain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the land here is costly The manure from the lizard swamp is mixed with the native soil and there is also a dozens of artificial ditches that bring the water from the Dono River to irrigate, but this is not the main reason why the crop here is so good. Hundreds of magical arrays in the middle of the hundreds of acres of fertile fields are waving their way to the endless magical powers to walk into the land.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these magical arrays Expensive magic materials It’s top-notch, but the hundreds of accumulated amounts are enough to use copper to cover the 100-acre land. These crops are well-deserved as the most expensive crops on the Big Six. But their efficiency is definitely The most magical array of the Big 6 is the natural magical power produced by the Elf Magicians, which not only allows these crops to grow ten times faster than normal, but also harvests ten times a month.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magical farmland is standing on the edge of two old people who are talking to each other. One is the owner of this field and the other is the creator. These two relationships should be very Good old people and standing on the side of the field for a long time also bargained for a long time. Even the young people behind them have already begun to show an impatient look.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After a half-hour negotiation and a counter-offer, the two men at the same time gave a sigh of relief and announced the end of the battle. One of the old men waved his hand to the back and even said this. The elf girl, who was covered in green and vitality, came over.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May Mafa forgive me" Luya sighed and took out a small The pocket seed was handed to Elder Lloyd.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Lloyd took the small pocket of the seed and smiled a bit, looking at the dumb eyes, although bitter, but more It is pity: "It is none of your business. Marfa understands that your piety and purity are all borne by me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
