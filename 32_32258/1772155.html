			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid of a silver armor with a long sword and a long sword at the door of the mansion rides on a snow-white head and looks down at the two servants. “Is this the residence of Aisisi?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two servants of the gatekeepers are all over the age of 50. The two old men looked at the Santa Croce of the horsewoman and quickly bowed their heads and answered, "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The view of the horsewoman swept over the two old men. Sweeping the slightest head and riding straight into the Ma Chaofu, and went inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adults and you" two old people remember that the master had told them to forbid foreigners to enter and today they also specially found some people to watch around the house but did not dare to block . The Holy Cross pattern on this knight shows that her identity is at least the level of the bishop, and the majesty that is naturally revealed between the every move and the eyebrows is also automatically revered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't want to die, you'd better go home soon." The horsewoman did not return the next sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards in the garden were all surrounded but looked at the heavily armed Knights of the Temple but did not dare to block. In Elazia, perhaps the official residence of this private mansion needs a notification, but a shrine knight will never use it. Don't say that if you sneak into it, there is no one who dares to block the investigation. The guards next to them are mostly employed by the brain. The smart people who saw the situation are wrong and have begun to turn around. And there are a few more guards who just saw the horsewoman from afar and immediately turned to escape the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple did not pay attention to those who drove the horse directly to the door. The door closed and the knight took a sword and waved the iron door bolt from the door of the door. The iron bolt was immediately divided into two. The reins of the white horse and the long horse kicked the front door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the commotional butler immediately ran out and saw the horsewoman who had just ridden into the hall, her face immediately changed her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight’s knife-like gaze immediately stared at the butler. The butler immediately squeezed out a pair of awkward smiles and said, "Is this adult not knowing what is going on with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aisi Where?" The knight asked coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The original you are looking for my owner. Please wait for me to inform me that my master will come out to see you immediately." The housekeeper turned and walked toward the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stand up." The knight gave a cold drink. But the butler not only did not stand still, but ran a few big steps and rushed to a corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white light flashed through the housekeeper’s headless body and continued to run a few steps and turned a half-bend before it fell to the ground with a splash of bleeding in the neck. . The Cavaliers rifle only left a short gun handle inserted in the corner of the wall. The head of the housekeeper's head was covered with walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other servants who saw this scene all screamed and went out to the outside. The horsewoman squinted at the group and was sure that these people didn't understand what was going on and pulled the rifle on the wall and walked toward the inner hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noise of the ground did not reach below. The largest room in the basement. Helicika and Aisisi stood in front of hundreds of hands with seven masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want money? The bright gold coins." The scream of Hilika echoed in the basement. Each note is swaying from the heart of the ** and the wildness more than the beast's howl rather than the human voice. "Answer me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think." The gangsters responded with a response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then follow me to get it. I tell you that after each of these things, each of you can get more than a hundred gold coins. You can feel free to The dry woman’s enjoyment kills people and is respected.” The sound of Hilika’s voice suddenly summed up the loudest and loudest roar. "Because you will have money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gangsters under his command followed a screaming scream, especially the old members of the Shamuthi thieves group. Red and breathless like a bull. Although Helicel is more brutal than anyone else, it is more beneficial to follow him than anyone else. Every time such a party arrangement order is followed by a big action such as robbing the official treasury, it is a lot of gold coins. After seeing Helica for a long time, they seem to be able to feel the wildness and the ** of the gold coins boiling all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Violence fear. This is always the only principle that controls people to push the world. This is the meaning of people living. The Shamuthi thieves group can reach the present level and will take it to the next level because it has mastered the principles of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the seven people behind him were quiet and quietly watching the passionate bandits as if they were enjoying a group of animals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short, unusual sound blended in the screams of the gangsters as if a small wave surged in the waves could not be noticed. All the gangsters were unaware. But the faces of Hilika and a few people behind him changed instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Axis and the old man, the eyes of Helicika and the other six people gathered at the largest stairway. That is the channel that goes straight down from above. They are familiar with the voice just now. It was the sound of the neck that was cut off in half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bandits also noticed from the eyes of the collar that the anomalies looked at the passage. Just now, the atmosphere was so loud that it was so loud that it was going to explode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Pumping’ A ball-shaped thing rolled down the stairs and rolled down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who is close by the fire sees this thing. It’s a horrified look on the head of the individual. It’s still like a living mouth. The second half shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick Knife Jack." The man who knew this head cried. That is the thief who is alert at the entrance of the channel. The agile alertness is a good knife. It is said that once the knife can cut off the heads of two people, but the body does not touch the blood, but I can’t think of who is silent now. The head was cut down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔嚓咔嚓. In the silent silence of everyone's breath, a footstep sounded from the dark passage. Subtle and steady, not slow or slow, do not panic or deliberately want to conceal their own traces, so as to walk in the usual way. Only the subtle metal friction sounds have shown that this is a man in armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breathing in the basement was noticeably rushed. Even some people's faces showed the color of fear. The footsteps seemed to come from hell's evil spirits and stepped on everyone's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A faint white light gradually lit up in the channel as the footsteps approached. As the coming people came down slowly, this person appeared in the eyes of everyone from foot to head. First, a pair of feet on the bright silver steel boots and then a body armor that shows every line of the body just right. One hand, one sword, one hand, a lance, and finally a handsome, beautiful, beautiful face, a golden yellow. The sun shines like a show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is shrouded in a layer of milky white light that illuminates the dim basement. The light of this body matches the appearance and face of the evil spirits that are not just hell. If it is not the blood and the smoldering blood of the body and the long sword in her hand, she is simply a fighting angel who descends to the mortal world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is the Knight of the Temple." There was a robber yelling. More than a hundred bandits suddenly crashed and even a few of them just joined and fled to another passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika stepped forward from the hand of a man and took a two-handed epee and threw a hand that was running away and was immediately penetrated by the nail. On the wall. The epee is a person who penetrates from the abdomen and does not immediately scream and wailing. The wailing immediately made everyone calm down. Others who wanted to escape immediately stood still and sweated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika did not pay attention to his men and turned to the female knight and said: "I heard that you have been a long time. How come this time to deal with us?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It took me a lot of thought to investigate your dens." The Knights of the Temple did not care that they faced hundreds of the most fierce criminals in Erasia. Whether it is the sound or the expression, it is as calm as the ice. It seems like this is just a group of lambs. She put a knight in her right hand and pointed at all the bandits and pointed to the face of Hilika. "All the people here are sinful and bloody hands. No need to judge me in the name of the Lord, here you will let your soul go to Purgatory to punished your sins."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha" Helicika's laughter is like a crazy lion. He looked at the Knights of the Shrine and smiled and shook every muscle on his face. Even if it was a monster, there was no such awkward expression. He almost gasped and said, "Is it by you alone? I tell you the noble Knight of the Temple. The last woman who dared to speak with me in this condescending tone of speech was raped by me all day. All the holes in her body have been tried by me. I also used a knife to open a few. And you "his hand to the female knight handsome beautiful face volley force as if to also open a hole in the other side. Hey, "I want to use you for a week. I want all my men to try your holy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the entire basement has shaken a little like the cardinal body of Hilika. It was actually driven by the gun and flew up and hit the stone wall behind. The pistol pierced his shoulder directly through his arm. The flesh of the bloody violent rifle passed through the wound was not torn but the blood burst immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only a few heads left by a few bandits who have fallen silently. They unfortunately stood in the trajectory of this gun and still did not understand what happened when they gave birth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the thieves are eclipsed and even the seven people with Hilika are almost horrified. They all can see that they can’t stand and hide. Can't make such a blow. Everyone knows that the strength of the Knights of the Temple is absolutely amazing, but I don’t think it will be so amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Goddess is also a look of surprise. This is a full shot. Even the Iron Man can definitely smash and the rogue leader is actually only injured. At the time, with amazement agility and reflection, I hid in the side to avoid the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Slaughter her." Xi Lika screamed like a bear and pulled out a rifle with a flesh and blood. Even he understands that it is almost impossible for such an enemy to give birth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robbers around are madly rushing with this command. Here is the basement, even if it is an escape route, only the narrow and narrow beasts of the beasts completely excite their courage and fighting spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long sword in the hands of the female knight turned into a group of light curtains. The first sneak sneaked into a pile of broken limbs and flew open. It’s not that fighting is a unilateral slaughter, it’s easier than cutting a melon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All retreat." Helicika was another big drink. He now sees the white light that surrounds the Knights of the Temple. It is a mixture of dozens of amazing auxiliary magics and their own vindictiveness. This kind of martial art has been amazingly high. With the help of magic, the combat power is not comparable to that of your own. The female knight occupies the passage of the passage without worrying about the absolute difference in combat power. The number of weak people can't play any role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thieves heard the order and immediately retreated. Hilika turned and looked at the seven people's voices that began to calm down and calmed down with a faint expression: "You are not going to let this blind man kill my men and then go to Tulalon for a few of us." "...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not." The old man coughed and coughed out of his sleeve and took out a strange wand and even a few poultry. feather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other five people are walking towards the horsewoman. They are very careful and cautious. The thieves around were hiding from the side to give these people a place to let them out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight whispered a whisper of the white light on her body, and the long sword in her hand was dazzling. She looked coldly at the faces of the five opponents who were coming like ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old five people who are constantly approaching the back of the old man gently shake the whimsical wand in their mouths with a strange curse and a low-pitched tone. It looks like a dying person is squatting. On the staff, there was a strange light. The old man raised his staff and shouted at the female volley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one saw any magic coming out of the staff but the female knight’s body shook twice and the red blood rolled down her nostrils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sorcerer actually dares to use the soul magic to the believers of God." The female knight suddenly drank a pair of phoenix eyes and shot the blood on the mouth. The blood in the end is standing. Although her snowy face looks awkward because of the blood, but the old man seems to have nothing to do except to make her wolf. The female knight turned to look at the murderous murderousness of the old man. She reached out to the old man in a tone of majesty and anger like a person yelling a mouse that had just bitten himself. "I will judge you in the name of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bright white light shot from the palm of the Knights of the Temple directly across the front of the man on the old man's body . The old man is because the other side has been hard hit by himself and he is still alive and kicking. He is too stunned by the white light and immediately screams like a chicken to scream and smoke down to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Five Arrows?" The five people in front of them can't think of this pretty female white magic. This was originally a mere action against the undead creatures and the ability to produce such a lethal effect on humans, at least the level of magic of a senior priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the subconscious reaction of those who have been soaked in the battle of life and death. A newly-emerging opponent is a perfect target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman wrapped in her black robe throws her robes, her face is still covered with black velvet, a black tights, tightly slender and full. Everywhere, the body is filled with strength and temptation like a black female leopard. She held a dark blue dagger in her hands and saw that she was poisoned. A thin and small man dragged his hand with a sword that was taller than his body and thick and slashed. He could also kill people and hit people who could not crush the dead. The other man’s hands are holding a pair of swords. The three men rushed to the horsewoman in three different directions. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind that swelled by a huge sword with one person and one thicker was directly covering up all the sounds in the basement. The sword shadow is overwhelming. In order to swing such a huge weapon, the skinny man almost used the strength of each muscle of the body. He seems to have become a subsidiary part of this giant sword. With the swing of the sword, the person is jumping and swinging vertically. It’s even worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the more deadly is the two short swords of the masked woman. Her body image is only hidden in the waves of the fish. The waves of the two-handed sword slid into the neck of the horsewoman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who uses the sword is the latest but the fastest. The frontal attack space has been filled with the huge two-handed sword. He jumped to the top of the basement and then turned to borrow the strength of the string of arrows to pounce on the top of the horsewoman. His whole person seems to be a magnified countless More sharply, the countless times of the needles, the two fists of the sword, the screams of the past, even overshadowed the roar of the two-handed sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sinister all the elements that can kill people are in the attack of these three people. Although the three were the first to join forces, they almost took the most reasonable and efficient way of cooperation. The choice and attack method based on this subconscious mind is definitely a top-notch master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this murderous weapon, the white light of the female knight in the waves of the smashing weapon can shine like the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her actions are unusually simple. She jumped up and just escaped the giant sword that was swept away. The black women’s two short swords that had been aimed at the neck of the horsewoman only stabbed the pair of steel shackles with two sparks from the armor. The woman had not yet had time to take the sword and the knight was throwing her. Under the chest. The horsewoman's arm didn't look too thick, but the punch knocked back the black woman who was about the same size as her body. Everyone can clearly hear the sound of broken ribs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as her left hand punched, the sword of the right hand turned into a light curtain to meet the man who sprinted down the volley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volley-stricken man seems to be the most embarrassed and most eager to take such a devastating attack. However, only the most accurate defenses taken by his judgment are most effective. Almost as soon as the Knights of the Temple had just swung a sword, he judged that the sword could be cut into two pieces before his sword stabbed his opponent. Originally, there was no such thing as a sword that the strong man never returned. He immediately took it back and placed it in front of the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this sword is not only fast, but also powerful. The two crossed swords are framed but not supported. The long white sword with white light continued to continually move forward with two swords. Finally, the man was desperate to use the strength of the milk to resist, but did not let the blade break through the limits of his arm. Only the body shape has been swooped from the volley by this sword and turned back. The sword tip finally put his face down from the forehead to the eyebrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the two men were knocked back, the flashing two-handed sword was re-rolled back. The horsewoman stepped on the top of Jianfeng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of sword with hundreds of pounds is hard and it seems that there is absolutely no need to grind very sharply and can't wave too fast so the knight's steel boots When the foot was steady, the local stepped on the top of Jianfeng and bounced to the wall by the force of the wave. Then she again rebounded on the wall and took a step back against the white light on the thin man's sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two-handed swords have been hollowed out. Such bulky weapons cannot be pulled back to defense immediately. But the skinny man was waving with this giant weapon and swinging the strange tacit and rhythm between the man and the sword. This time, the giant sword and the master swayed each other slightly, and the person was completely close to the wide position. After the blade is about the same as the door panel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
