			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;镣铐 Each ring made of special steel is a chain. Strengthening the strength and toughness of the cockroach itself also applies weakness to the bound object. This kind of thing doesn't look like it's an elephant that locks an elephant or a magical one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s body now has three such shackles. The overlap on his body wraps around as if wearing a weird dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here is not the horrible underground jail but the duke's study. Asa is not a mixed blood and blood lying on the ground but sitting on a chair without any injury. It just looks very frustrating. No matter who falls to this point, it is impossible to get up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Mulak looked at Asa through the desk and smiled and said: "The three deputies are actually the former Kusbert priests to help you prepare to hear that it is magic. The college was specially made for a time to bind a Tauren Sacrifice. In fact, I have never thought about catching you before, but you have not let me down. Haha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't let you down? Are you afraid that I won't come?" Asa sat in the chair and looked coldly at the duke's smiling face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. I believe you will come. This is originally in my plan. It’s just that I was going to kill you on the spot, but I ended up with Changed my mind and hoped to catch you as much as possible. You really didn't let me down and didn't kill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you do for me? I thought you would I cut my tongue with my hands and feet and cut my eyes. I also said that Asa’s eyes were half-closed and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak well. In fact, I really should deal with you like this. Hehehehe." The Duke laughed. Like a surprise, a playful joke, laughing, happy, thick and gentle, the eyes are all smiling. Looking at the opponent in front of him and finally falling into his own hands and no struggle to resist the room, he sighed with a deep emotion. "Maybe from a certain point of view, the enemy is the best friend. It not only brings you the joy of fighting spirit and victory, but because you have a clear stand and no scruples, you don't need to cover your intentions more than your friends." Say something in your heart. Everything is straightforward and even a hostile thing is a very happy thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You look like a little happy." Asa said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Wrong.” The Duke’s hand made a negative gesture or smiled so happy. "Not a little happy. It was very happy. I almost never forgot when it was so happy last time. Because I never seem to have spent so much time dealing with a person. And after all, I won." He is very satisfied with the look of the young man who is completely a loser. The look of Asa is actually a bit sad. "When you die, call me to find such an enemy and go find a friend who can talk so quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A footstep approached. The duke shut his mouth and frowned. He had already ordered all other people in the government not to be close to the study. He had to secretly interrogate the prisoners. The dialogue between him and Asa cannot be heard by others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the study was pushed open by Rod Hart and came to the Duke for a ceremony: "Sorry Duke adults. Colonel Roland and an old pastor are working At the gate of the government, he said that he would bring the wanted criminals to ask the emperor to personally interrogate with the great priests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head of Roland? He asked him to send someone When I didn’t send it now, I asked someone to ask for it.” The Duke frowned and thought about waving his hand gently: “Take them temporarily.” He did not say how to use it to drag. He only knows that he said that Rod Hart would naturally do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Rodhart turned and went out. He didn't look at Asa until the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a very smart and capable young man. The key is that he knows the situation and always knows to make the right choice in the situation." Sa. "But your choices are not very correct."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I have never been a smart person." Asa replied faintly. "But even if I am not smart, I know that it is not a good place for the detainee to interrogate people. You should not bring me to me if you bring me here."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Transaction? Don't you let me go." Asa's eyes and tone are still not weak. "I am not so smart but I know that it is impossible for you to let me go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s right." The duke nodded or smiled. So kind. "You know that you have to die since things have reached this point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what do you trade with someone who knows you are going to die? If you don’t even have a life, can you still care about it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I don’t know what you care about. Even if you don’t even have a life, you still care about one. Human. My daughter. Hehe. Don't you just venture here for her? I will take her life to deal with you." The Duke's smile seemed to be compassionate. "As long as you promise me, I won't kill her. You can rest assured that she is not hurting or even better than you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa didn’t answer but the eyes had The fluctuations. For a long time, he said in a strange voice: "You use your daughter's life to force me to a dying person to promise your condition? Others will hear you think you are crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What other people say doesn't matter. The key thing is that I know that you will promise," the Duke said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want me to do?" Asa sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s eyes slammed up and said in a word: “I want you to admit that Sedros and the Necromancer colluded together to instruct you to assassinate Bishop Ronis. As long as you admit this in the emperor and the church, I swear not to hurt the little sister to ensure that she lives as well as before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oath?" Asa squeezed a smile. "Is this thing even if I am a fart, can you still care?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke sighed. There seems to be another father's breath on his face. "Small 懿 is my daughter is so capable. After all, do you think I want to kill her? But she knows that I actually killed Bishop Ronis and she stood with you as a disciple of Cedrus. I am afraid that she will be associated with Cedrus for the sake of your eligibility, so I have to plan to kill her. And if you can identify that Cedros is actually the murderer behind the scenes, then you will die without me. I won’t be bothering her. This time you are riding a two-legged dragon. This is the biggest evidence of the collusion between Cedros and the Necromancer. I also guess that Cedros would say that it was stolen by yourself. Even so, it is enough. I naturally have the way to add fuel to my fire." It seems that I thought of the good situation in the future and the Duke smiled again. He really seems too happy and happy today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed: "It turns out that you are so happy not only because you caught me but also because you can use me directly to deal with Cedros."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The Duke nodded. "Oh, I seem to have thought of the situation in which the church and the empire have joined forces to deal with Oufu. I will personally bring the troops. I really want to thank you for the two-legged dragon that you brought today to remind me of the role of this kind of thing on the battlefield. Before I go to attack, I must persuade the military ministers and emperors to let them buy more griffins first. Hehe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa still said faintly: "Since you Do you know that I have been to Oufu to get in contact with Cedros? Isn't it afraid that we have already agreed on how to deal with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" Duke A smile. "Whatever you have to do. Your murder of the bishop is already fixed. Cedrus can't even send out the orc troops to help you brazenly. He has to leave a path for himself. Maybe you don't come back and stay in Europe. Fu and Sedros together I will be afraid of what you are doing. But I know that you must come back. Oh, are you already in my hands now?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed and nodded. "You think very carefully. I did ask Cedros to help me but he refused. He is as scrupulous as you expected. And I... indeed I have to come back. You really look at people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking at people is the most basic and important point in setting up strategies and traps." The duke smiled happily like a celebrity chef to explain to his diners the good food of his own. He said to Asa that it is necessary to let the other person taste it before fully relishing the charm and meaning of his masterpiece. "As long as you see what kind of reaction the person is facing, you can calculate each step and design the overall situation. Even if you let the other party know your intentions, you can only walk step by step according to your wishes. Come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Hehehehe." The Duke smiled very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look at you so happy now." Asa suddenly whispered. "But I haven't promised to help you plant Cedrus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I believe you will promise." The duke's face seems to be written. A few words 'the world is in my hands'. "Like I believe that you will definitely return."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa still seems to be weak and seemingly dying. The voice that shook his head was also very low: "No. I won't promise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke is stunned. "What?" He was surprised to think he had got it wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I won't promise." Asa's voice was a little bigger. "Because I don't have to agree at all." After saying this, he suddenly stood up from his chair. A series of sounds from the body slid down to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s expression solidified. He is sure that these cockroaches are absolutely well locked and can definitely lock a Tauren who is ten times more powerful than humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have been so relieved. It seems that I believe in the shackles of these bundled cows. Indeed, I admit that I am not a cow earning is absolutely earning." Asa Raised a wooden thorn on his finger. "But I just know something like a trap mechanism. You just let me sit in a chair instead of letting me lie on the ground. It's just that it's not very difficult to open the lock of the cow."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke was only amazed and didn’t panic. He didn't even stand up and just sink his face and voice: "There are no people around the study, but the outside is full of guards. I advise you not to think that you can turn things around with just the luck you just encountered." I also advise you not to waste my chance to give you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Asa does not seem to show any cherish for these opportunities. His original obscured eyes have already Gradually clear and sharp. Same as his voice. "I never thought you were an enemy before. The way we have to go is fundamentally different. So although you have to deal with me several times, I don’t think you are awful and don’t want to deal with you. Because I am also involuntarily. Only then stopped on your way. But then I realized that I was wrong. You even have to kill the bishop of Ronis, there is also Sandru....even even the little sisters are not let go...." Asa's voice and expression Finally, because the excitement is a bit distorted. "Even if I saved a small donkey, but as long as you are still she or someone else, you can't be peaceful." Asa whispered a few words with the voice that had been distorted by anger: "So I want to kill you." His eyes were full of bloodshot words, and the teeth of the mouth were sprayed with the smell of the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was too surprised and too disappointed. I gave up my chance to give you." The Duke's expression was completely cold. He slowly stood up and grabbed the sword on his waist and screamed: "Come on. The prisoner broke free from the shackles and ran away." The duke's face was all murderous and calm but the shouting could Put on the taste of panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the snoring, the Duke still said so quietly to Asa: "I will say that you are too disappointing. I just know that you are not smart." Will benzene reach this point. Do you think this is the vulgar story that is popular in the pub? Can you come to a big reversal of the situation with just a few luck?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;There was a footstep in the hallway immediately but it was not the kind of noise that the guards should have. This is just a person's footsteps. The footsteps came very quickly and it was only a few blinks, and I almost came outside the study. Although it is very urgent, it should be a little flustered, but every step is very precise according to a strange rhythm. This is the voice that talents who have integrated martial arts into every part of their body can make a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa suddenly turned and kicked on the door of the study. A loud bang, two doors ruptured and flew toward the corridor, slamming into a figure that was flying towards it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure and then a glimpse of the white line in the air, looming in the air, two imposing breaks immediately broke down silently A small piece of broken piece of wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wood chips are scattered and set the sword. A gray face full of books and angry faces has a pair of eyes that are as sharp as a sword. He was the head of Roland, who had just been dragged by Rod Hart at the gate of the Dukes. He heard the first rush of the Duke's shouting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Asa turned around and faced the first swordsman of the empire behind the Duke. And the head of Roland seems to have only chopped the two doors and suddenly disappeared and suddenly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke was surprised and looked sideways to see Asa behind him. The head of Roland is still there in the corridor outside the study. It was just that he was standing on his head and seemed to be moving forward and pressing on the hilt. But he kept such a position and did not move as if it had become a stone statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke suddenly noticed a strange breath. This is not a scent that does exist, but a pure feeling that will naturally occur when staring at a giant beast. Although there were no beasts in sight, the Duke could know that the source of this feeling was at the corner of a corridor not far behind Roland’s head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can see what is there and no one hears what is going on, but everyone doesn’t even have to be a person, even if one other animal is here. The difference and danger there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This weird and dangerous feeling is even stronger. The Duke has a feeling of standing in front of the sea where the tsunami is about to blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s body slowly bent down. His head was buried even deeper. It seemed that he still closed his eyes and held the sword. If he is brewing a typhoon behind him, then his sword and his sword are a mountain volcano that can't be shaken at any time but can burst into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An eccentric cracking sound A leader on the corridor behind the head of Roland was broken with a porcelain bottle placed on it. It seems to be squeezed by a pair of invisible big hands, and the fragments are scattered to the middle and are scattered all together in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the head of Roland did not move the corner of the crowd who did not move. There was no sound out of that area, and it seemed that even the air had condensed into a solid. But once the things brewed in the weird silence burst out, the entire ducal palace might burst like a vase under heavy blows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke is already sweating on his head. He didn't even breathe smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The accidental things that come with luck naturally have something that is not luck." Asa’s voice suddenly sounded when this strange and dignified. "Actually, the bondage of my body should be waiting for him to come to me. But it seems that he seems to know that I have no way to do it, so I only have to do it myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The hand of the Duke holding the sword and the blue veins on his forehead are dancing his voice and he has never done the same thing: "Do you really have a plan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"When you see the Wyvern, you will know that I have been to Oufu. So even if I fail to save you, you should be reluctant to let me die. You must use me at least to interrogate me. When you say these things, you will definitely not let others be alone. These are plans for you." Asa squeezed the sound of the skull section and the sound of the sound in this strange silence is very crisp. "What kind of reaction you have to know who the other person is, this is indeed the most important part of the trap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Duke’s eyes are also jumping. "You are gambling. I am surprised that Cedros will make such a dangerous plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right. Cedros will not accompany I bet but other people will. One will help me plan another and promise to help me. Of course, they also let me promise the conditions they have proposed. But whatever conditions are better than yours." Asa said and slowly and Roland The head of the team bent down. The body radiated a light white glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately you lost the gambling." The Duke's slash slowly moved to the front and pointed at Asa. His wrist did not move or move, but the tip of the sword was shaking like a serpent. "You two really have nothing to say. But now you only have one. And there are thousands of soldiers outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know who lost now." Sa coldly answered the light in his eyes more sharp than the Duke's sword. The white light of his whole body has gathered on his fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s sword shook even more like a snake that would fly out at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly a person sighed and said: "If you don't know who is losing now, it must be because his head is full of bowel movements."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
