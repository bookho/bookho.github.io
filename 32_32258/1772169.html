			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your ears are good." The man's smile still looks eccentric, but the sound is a bit sharp like a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ear? Are you coming to touch?" Jessica not only came out but also came over. The smile on her face is like sugar or the kind of sugar added to the aphrodisiac spice. It gives off the taste of the most subtle string that can provoke the deepest and most intimate and sensitive places in the heart. She didn't seem to say anything but this laugh can make people think of everything. She not only came over but also sat directly at the man's side and raised the man's hand on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting is a silky, delicate and smooth feeling. She pulls the man's hand and slides into the silky black to the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man stunned because he didn’t touch anything that should be the ear. There is nothing or only two smooth scars on the ear hole. . The voice of his speech was deliberately controlled very small. Others including the position of the woman. He also knew that even the wolf's ear could not hear his voice, not to mention that she could not even count her ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will read my lips when I see it." The woman's hand was placed on his shoulder and stretched out and sat down on his body. Her voice is very hot and very sweet, and the sand is like a pot of sugar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, that's your eyesight is very good." The man smiled. His hand did not get back but continued to slide back toward the back and the last finger stopped at the first section of the cervical spine behind her head. This is an absolute cause. As long as the effect and beheading are almost as effective as a knife into the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what she hears or sees, it will never be just this sentence. And if those words let others know. Although it is not necessarily a bad thing, it is not a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a good eyesight and there are a lot of good places. You know it right away..." She began to breathe gently and didn't seem to care about her neck at all. The waist sitting on the man's lap twisted and the chest was also posted on the man's chest. The tights are not thick enough to clearly feel that the subtle two places below are firm. She slowly started to rub with a gasp and began to wander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suggest you stop." The man's voice is still very cold. The fingers are slightly tight. "I am not used to let a person I don't know climb up and down on my body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You say that your body is not oh... "The woman's straddle is sitting on the waist of the man." The rounded and sleek buttocks pressed against the next one, and there was a screaming voice that couldn’t tell whether it was a breath or a sigh. Her hand slipped into the man's clothes and stroked and squeezed the delicate muscles and gasped and said, "You can rest assured. Since I dare to tell you these, I have never thought of obstructing you... I don't care what you do... ...I just want you...you are strong..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves are very rare on the Enros 6 and the elves are more alternatives in these elves. It is rare to see almost in the story. According to some ancient legends. This race is a dark underground from the ordinary elves who have abandoned the light and fallen into the darkness. Compared with the darkness of the night vision, the white head of the black-skinned skin, etc., the black elves leave people with the most profound impression, or their enthusiasm for enthusiasm in the old-fashioned population is ** debauchery. This trait makes this race that is more female than male seems to be a pure female tribe in the eyes of many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This eight-story female race is probably a long-standing genius for the continuation of race. The female night elves are eager to make most men crazy for those who are excited about the opposite sex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But how is your head black? The eyes are also..." The man hesitated to look at her silky black. All black elves are silver heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica’s mouth has been plunged into the man’s ear, and the wet, moist, small tongue has penetrated his ear and the teeth are gently biting and ambiguous. Say: "Since your face can be fake, why can't my head be..." Her voice mixed with the moisture she breathed had an intoxicating taste and seemed to be drunk into the pores. The skeleton. Her teeth biting a little on the man's face and slamming a mask has been torn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man slammed her over to the nails pressed against the fingers under her body and had fallen into the flesh of her neck. If she had the slightest sign of murder, her head had long been broken before the body had an action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are playing with fire." Asa looked coldly at the black elf under her body. From a human point of view, she is definitely a rare stunner. "Dare to directly expose my identity and let me know that you know my secret, do you want to die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death is all by myself. Since I dare You haven’t been afraid to say it before you... Do you know... When I saw your wanted order, I knew that it must be a very strong man... Big 6 has the highest and most sinister wanted in history... ...and see you again these two days. I feel that you must be you...except you who have such taste and wildness...you know...just the taste on you makes me excited..." Her hands continued to explore the depths of Asa's clothes and could not help but wrap up his waist. "You want to kill and kill... but please kill me afterwards... I die on such a man... What a pity..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa looked at Jessica's close-knit face and smelled the smell on her body. Feeling the friction of every inch of her body's touch on her body. In fact, his blood has already boiled like a magma. There has always been a huge mad impulse in the impact of all the changes in the Qing Dynasty. He left the back of her neck and slipped into her clothes and murmured the name: "This woman... Why kill..." His last voice also became a gasp and caught her. The clothes are pulled hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female elf under the sound of a loud, smashing sound burst out with excitement and excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cyster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was originally a huge barren hillland that has been a holy place in the center of the church for more than two hundred years. At that time, the unfair king of Erasia presented this land to the church and also funded countless resources and money to build the most magnificent and greatest building to date. The headquarters of the church is a shining castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brilliance of the brilliance of the marble is built in the sun. The majestic size of any imperial palace reflects the supreme majesty of God. The sinuous marble reflects the sun. In the surrounding clouds, a white and gold radiance is reflected in each other. The entire castle is saturated with the holy radiance of white magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred grandeur. Glorious Castle is enough to imprint these three concepts directly into the souls of the believers who pay homage to it. Even the unruly people who are not religious, even the pagans who worship the devil, have to face the fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glorious Castle's transfer magic array is built in the lower center of the square. There is no special arrangement to send the guards of the magic array. Or everyone who is completely unnecessary to walk here is at least a senior magician and dozens of templars and shrine knights of Megatron. It is more sacred and holy than anywhere else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light that sends the magic array lights up. A young warrior appeared in the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior is very young, very handsome, very powerful and very good looking. If you have a long golden inch, you must be as dazzling as the overflowing sun. However, such a short-flow overflow is not a light but a casual temperament. The blue scorpion is pure like a jewel, but a sneak look at it is like a boundless ocean. His mouth is still relaxed and natural and the solemn solemnity around him does not seem to be inconsistent, but seems to add a little vitality to the environment. No matter who is such a young person, it will feel very comfortable and pleasing to the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior walked down the passing magical priest and smiled and nodded to him: "God bless you the Templar. Has your mission been completed?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lord's blessing of those barbaric nomads is vulnerable." The young Templar also smiled and nodded. There is still blood on his body and even the face on his head is not known because of his own natural and temperament, or because the holy atmosphere of this glorious castle is not conspicuous. "I am rushing to return to the Knights of Lancelot. I hope I am the first. Hehe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh Lancelot Knight is working There are also a few bishops in the conference hall with the Pope, you can go to the exhibition in front of the hall and wait for the Knights of Talis to be there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Did Talis Knight come back so soon? I am the first one outside of me." The Templar smiled and scratched his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall next to the hall is in the empty hall. The Pope is holding a meeting with the bishops. Only the goddess Knight Talis is facing the altar and repenting. A footstep sounded her and she turned around and nodded to the coming person: "God is with you. Jiawei Samurai."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to this. Have you cleared the nomads who have harassed the Principality of Castries?" The horsewoman was surprised. "That...but the most difficult task that Lancelot announced. It was originally a mission to promote the Knights of the Temple. You are in such a short time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It is the blessing of the Lord. The body of the pagans is not as strong as the broken paper under the shining sword of the Lord." The Templar's tone was generous but it showed enough humility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis is only amazed in the heart of the earth. Although this young warrior is now only a Templar, it is only because the qualifications are absolutely above himself in terms of his ability. From the time he was admitted to Celeste by Adela, he showed extraordinary strength and talent in just one or two months. It can definitely be regarded as a rare genius warrior in Celeste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just a genius of a warrior but he is so good everywhere. I took the halo that was originally on Talis, the youngest knight of the temple, on my own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Talis himself did not swear or hostile to him. She just admired the admiration. What he exudes is not only the excellent brilliance but also the attractive charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The rest of the settlement work has been handed over to the Principality. I want to come back first and fight for the first place. How do you know..." Templar Laughing and smiling at the white teeth reveals the vitality and vitality of his young man. "I don't think you can take the first step. It is the youngest disciple of the Knights of the Temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...I..." Talis Zhang Jun's face is red. It’s enough to say a word. "I failed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" The Templar seemed extremely surprised. "How come... Are you going to Erasia with Bishop Aschard? The situation there is not dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All are me The fault of this glorious armor on the dust of the honor of the Knights of the Shrine is also dimmed. I came to report the failure of the Lancelot and the Bishop of Ascher." I said it in the voice of remorse. "I was ordered to destroy the thieves of Elazia, but in the end I ran away... No... I even failed to escape. I was caught by the thieves. Fortunately, one of the believers of the Lord took the risk to save me. Otherwise..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Templar frowning asks: "Isn’t there a few top magic scrolls for each knight? Are you not willing to use it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used it. But...the two elements of the giant are just a hit by the opponent..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "A single shot can destroy two elements of the giant?" The Templar was amazed but he immediately said with a smile. "Since the failure of this battle is not your fault, but the opponent is too strong. You can retreat from the whole body. This is God's blessing. You don't have to blame yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the opposite smile that is as bright and warm as the sun. Talis was unconsciously relaxed. Although strictly speaking, she is still higher than his predecessor, but I don’t know why she always feels much smaller in front of him. I always want to ask him for the urge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Templar frowned and thought about Talis: "Can you tell me about the battle? I am very good at such a powerful thief." Curious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things are like this..." Talis rehearsed the battle in the basement that day. Especially the man's move, the strange knife is described in great detail. The Templar heard it very carefully and asked a lot in many places. It seems that the appearance looks quiet and peaceful, but there seem to be countless waves rolling in the blue scorpions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talisi looked at him quietly. This is why she is such a strong man who seems to be much bigger than herself. That's because although he has the energy and vitality of young people, he also has deep things that ordinary young people don't have. For example, wise and restrained. These wealths, which were supposed to have considerable setbacks and pains, can be accumulated in such a young man's age, which naturally makes the gem shine more beautifully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Templar thought about it and said, "I am daring to advise you on the Talis Knight. Your failure this time... actually is also arrogant with you. Personality is related."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
