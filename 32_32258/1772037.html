			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The search for the terrorist prisoner has been in full swing for a month. A team of teams of guards can be seen everywhere on the street. The streets and alleys have been attached to the portraits. People are talking about the prisoners above. Some people say that the spies sent by the enemy country are said to be a new kind of orc and others are said to be the evil spirits of the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa followed the old man of Sandru and a few vegetable vendors around the butcher shop to listen to the boss’s mouth and tell the cultist how to scream in the hand The people in the prison suddenly turned into a river. Several vegetable vendors whispered to go to the church to ask for holy water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The holy water must be sprinkled on the underwear in the close-fitting area is most effective." The old man of Sandru said to several vegetable vendors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team of patrolling guards and Asa passed by and several of them curiously glanced at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is just a glance. Even Asa did not dare to blame himself when he saw the mirror. His current face is like a waxy ugly face that is re-solidified when it is half-fired in the fire. The pits are covered with oil and the sarcoma facial features are twisted into a group and the eyes are dragged. Even a half-orc or a big-eared monster is handsomer than his ten generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course this is just a mask. A mask that is well done can still see that the blood vessels on the pore tumors are as faint as they are, and they are as elastic as real skin. The old man's craftsmanship was very good to wear and didn't feel any discomfort. Asa did not dare to ask him what he was doing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you bend your back and walk from a mat, you can take a look and wear a worn robes that are covered in the whole body. It is very suitable for appearance. Followed by Sandro on the street for two days, a few people on the street are familiar with him and know that he is the hunchback assistant of the old man of Sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru’s old man is actually a man of the School of Magic and the big house full of corpses is also a school of magic, which makes Asa a little surprised. Even in the countryside of his Karundo, those miners and blacksmiths who are addicted to bad wine and prostitutes have to mention the respect of the magic school. That is the most important institution of the church. In the minds of many people, the center of the church is almost the same as the place where the magical cultivation of pastors and magicians is studied. It is not as interesting as the street rumors to tell the lower class civilians about the royal or other military affairs. But once you are injured or have a bad heart, what is wrong with the guilt is from the priests of the Magic Academy to help. Therefore, in the eyes of ordinary people, it is a place of sacred and noble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s like a woman who seems to be holy again is just a person who will go to the bathroom. Since the School of Magic has to study healing magic, it is necessary to study the human body and there is a place to store the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, considering the sacredness of the church, this kind of research is only done in such a way that it is not necessary to do so in the School of Magic. The only living thing in the remote corner of the big house built on the west side of the city is the old man of Asa and Sandru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of Sandro's old man is actually just keeping and classifying various organs and limbs. It is very leisurely and sometimes goes to the market. But in general, I always like to smash the corpse, for example, to re-assemble different parts of several people into a human form. With some inexplicable magic, cut an organ into dozens of small pieces on the corpse and soak in dozens of different medicines, etc. such as. This is a very consuming hobby. So there is a good relationship between Sandru and the city's jailers and guards. As long as an insignificant or unclaimed body is immediately sold to him with a few copper coins. Asa's job is to help to divide the body and chopped organs to the market to buy daily necessities to solve the two people's diet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big house is usually no one close at all. But there will be one guest every two or three days except for the three wild cats nearby. It’s also an old man wearing a black robe and cheeky and thin. It’s like you’ve never eaten a full meal in your life. There’s a circle of black circles that seems to never sleep well. Every time you come to Shandru at night. Whenever this time, Sandru will let Asa enter the hut to read the book himself. The two old men chatted with candles in the big house full of dead bodies and organs until midnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two months ago, I saw from the hills of the wilderness in the west that my troops were completely annihilated and then killed by the orcs in the lizard swamp. The fugitive who went to the head and then came to the king to inexplicably become the most fascinating color of the whole king is now playing with a quirky old man in a big house full of corpses. I think that the experience of this time is even incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
