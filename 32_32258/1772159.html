			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no such thing as a lama before, but usually there was no impression. The only time I saw a lama on the Leshan Niuqiao Bridge was probably a pilgrimage to Lhasa. I took a awning wooden cart, a gas tank sleeping bag and so on. I walked three steps or five steps and then I fell forward. The five bodies are going to the west, and the knees and elbows are equipped with thick protective gears cut from the bottom of the tires. However, the distance from Lhasa to Leshan and the frequency of his worship are estimated to change several sets and go up several times. year. The passers-by around were very spectacle, looking around strangely around, and the children shouting and running around him, the lama was unmoved, still immersed in his lonely and sacred piety and admired again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, the lama has been a loyal and loyal believer in my opinion, preferring a religious symbol rather than treating it as a human being. Even in the backyard of Wuhou Temple in Chengdu, the lama, who is shaking money with a Buddha on the side of the road, does not dare to reconcile it with him. He even dares not to rush to give money, fearing that he has accidentally violated any taboos. After angering him, he was filled with old punches by a group of Tibetans who heard the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time going to Malcolm, although not more than Tibet, it can be regarded as deep into Tibetan areas. It is precisely because it is not Tibet, the religious atmosphere is not so strong, the atmosphere of life is much more, and let me see the various faces of the lamas, which impressed me a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-distance bus from Chengdu to Malcolm takes about ten hours. Before getting on the bus, I saw more than a dozen lamas in the waiting room, so I was very worried. The side is surrounded by an old lama who has only washed three baths in his life. But it was Amitabha. Finally, next to me was a Chengdu youth who was on a business trip to Malcolm. The masters were scattered around me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was boring on the road, I took out the phone and fiddled with it. Suddenly a fascinating Dongfeng broke the bell, I looked around and watched which hero was using the same ringtone as me. Dare to be clearer than mine. At first sight, I was shocked. I saw an old lama next door slightly closed, and a bunch of beads in the left hand smashed a grain of squad, and the right hand touched a Motorola's ultra-thin shape, and opened the 曰: "Hey. What's the matter? Oh, I received the text message..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing has never been familiar with mobile phones, at most only a few brands of symbols, but only look The shape of the fuselage looks at the shiny and shiny degree, I am sure that the hand-made brand in my hand is not worth the price of the shell, and I will not dare to provoke the master to laugh at the bargain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Li Lianjie’s "Huo Yuanjia" was put on the TV, and finally there was something refreshing. I secretly watched the masters around me. In addition to a few older people who are unmoved, the other young lamas are eager to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short while, Li Lianjie and the American wrestler on the TV played in the air, and I also sang with the young Chengdu next to me, talking about those from the Internet. What seems to be something, what is the internal power of the external work, the iron fist, the taijiquan, the knife of the knives, the Chinese people’s body, how the muscle mass is how the mental state is sensible, so how does Chinese Kung Fu develop how to express it in the Olympic Games? The big ball can't be invincible... I suddenly squinted, and the little mage around the old mage who shocked me with my mobile phone was squinting out to listen to my long story. The little lama looks like a twenty-year-old, with a pair of big eyes sparkling on her thin face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first arrived in Malcolm, the state sports meeting that was hitting Aba State was held here. I heard that there is a basketball game, I naturally want to see the technology of seeing Tibetan compatriots. When I went to the Aba County military division, the physical strength of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which we have dwarfed in the past, has disappeared in front of the Tibetan compatriots. Although the basketball level here is not very good, the momentum and physical strength I have completely exceeded CBA. On the field, like a dozen horny bulls, the wild horses are only flesh and blood in the collision. The emotions of the audience are also matched with this impulse. Unlike the Leshan people who can't play a fart with the three sticks, they never applaud gently, but they all scream and dance. The basketball atmosphere seems to be high. very. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am amazed at the fact that there are quite a few lama masters in the audience, and they are also loudly applauded. I haven't had time to recover from this shock. Aba County has already won a point. The audience who support Aba cheered and danced. One of the lamas pulled their robes and waved their heads, which made me stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days, the sports meeting is over. When I go out there again, the masters once again let my eyes open, I saw six robes on the court. Pulling down, it looks like a lama wearing a skirt screams in the wind. Although I can only count half of basketball and the other half is wrestling and rugby, this half of the basketball can't be considered a layman. There are more than a dozen lamas waiting to rotate next to the scene. I have carefully observed that these masters are all brand-name goods on their feet. It is not Adi's Nike, and they don't want to buy parallel imports like me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
