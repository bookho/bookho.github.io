			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death of the Minister of Military Affairs Garcia was not too shocking because two other more earth-shattering accidents were born on the same raft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most horrific birth of a devout royal clan in the Prince of Malcolm was pierced by a branch in his bed. This thing should be the earliest but the last one is present. When the next person took the news that the Count of Garcia was stabbed and went to knock on the door, this was the prince who had already died in bed. The blood has soaked the velvet bedding in this battle-hardened old man. In the battlefield, the savage soldiers have killed countless Tadalia's barbarians and Nigan's evil races are actually struggling and screaming. None of the guards at the door did not be alarmed, so they changed into a dead body. The windows of the bedroom, which open the branches that pierce the throat of the prince, are actually folded from a tree not far from the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there is General Clos. The commander of the border guard who has been responsible for the east front. The most familiar soldiers in the wilderness of Elazia drowned in the pits behind a pub. The pub is the day that the generals patronize every day, whether they are running the church or the boss or the customers inside. The people who have known the general for many years seem unlikely to be deliberate traps and murders. But the general's drink is as famous as his command. Elasia will not be the kind of drunk who will plant himself into the pit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the inspections of the pastor's pastors, the general's blood contained a strange magical fluctuation in addition to a large amount of wine. He was actually taken into action by a strange magic and then pushed into the pit to live in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ela was originally caught in the turmoil of the wind and the wind, and there were three hands holding the real power. The murder of the kingdom of the kingdom was smashed and searched for suspicious people. . The ministers are all inhabited by themselves, and they are surrounded by guardians all the time. Of course, in such a huge storm, those things that don't seem so important are not so conspicuous. For example, a few aristocrats were attacked a few days ago and it seems that they have been stolen from the property. However, these scorpions are vague about who was attacked and robbed. So no one cares. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tense atmosphere in the palace, especially the more heavily guarded soldiers and magicians five times more than usual. And as soon as this night, the guards are all as close as the enemy, and all the nerves are guarding against the assassins who will come out of any shadow at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the heart of defense. There is no guard around Deng’s palace under Queen Katherine’s. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that there is no guardian guard, but the Queen’s Majesty, because of the bad mood in these two days, I suddenly heard this kind of sadness and I was very bored, so I wanted to be quiet. So ordered to remove all the guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such an extraordinary period, such a very command can not be understood by anyone. But no matter how the ministers and the guards persuaded, even the two old commanders who had served the Queen for many years smashed the mouth and cried to dissuade the Queen, Her Majesty the Queen, and resolutely removed the guards around the palace. No one was allowed to approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the Queen’s most central kingdom knight. General Ou Ling did not join the ranks of dissuading the Queen to ask him why he only said a faint sentence: "I only know that Her Majesty's consideration of the problem is definitely more than her reason for her decision."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence seems quite reasonable. It is true that since Catherine’s insistence on this must have its own reasons as to what reason is there, no one will be indifferent to inquire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen's Palace is definitely the most expensive. The most beautiful and most elegant and the most flamboyant and most imaginative place. The room is not too big, but the smallest of the places can be seen in countless opportunities. The millennium agarwood carved marble and crystal-inlaid dressing table The most comfortable table and chairs and even the patterns on the floor walls are carefully crafted with different materials to perfectly combine elegance and luxury. Show it out. A dozen of crystal magic lights on the walls and ceilings that resemble works of art shine like white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the most distinctive place here is not the room itself but the people inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner is naturally the Queen of Catherine. Even if she is unparalleled. She is also enough to let the people admire her in front of her appearance and posture. And her temperament is cultivated. The mind is even more unparalleled. Such a large amount of material is concentrated on a woman like her. She is already a goddess in the eyes of mortals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the picture is seen by others, the shock is absolutely unparalleled. But that must also be the first shock and then shock. Before the surprise, it will be shaken by the perfect harmony of this picture. The man's looks and temperament are matched with the Queen of Catherine. No matter who sees it, they will think that this is the perfect pair of monks in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clothes on this man are not too expensive. Because people like him have long since no need to modify the temperament of every move, it is enough that even his age is the most attractive age of men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If those assassins really want to kill me, they won’t kill the few guys first." Why is it so plain that those people can’t see it? It’s really bothering me to make those people open.” Her Majesty sat down in front of the dressing table and frowned at herself in the mirror. The eyebrows that were originally thin and thick and fluttering were so wrinkled in the middle, and in the spirit of determination, they were like two thin swords. These sharp sharps were heavy in her delicate and beautiful world. It doesn't look awkward but adds a fascinating beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This world was originally a stupid person." The man smiled lightly. His hands were as long as a woman's slender white holding an ivory comb between the queen's under the brown-red scrolls. His movements are smooth and silky, and he enjoys the feeling of his hand walking through this soft and silky natural elastic roll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing in the world that is qualified to enjoy this feeling is that he is one of them. This is another kind of stronger feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen sighed and said: "I have to face so many stupid people all day. I have to find a way to arrange them. Sometimes I really feel very good." Tired."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man smiled and continued to sort out the Queen’s show: “If there are not so many stupid people, why are you high? This is the most in the world. It’s a stupid person. The most important thing is a fool.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s also true. If you are such a person, how do I rule this country. So you are like this. One of the people is enough." The Queen smiled at the man in the mirror. "Unfortunately, I can't keep you in captivity so that you can't go anywhere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man buried his face in the pile of maroon show and took a deep breath. Tone. Put all the fragrances into your body and kiss them and kiss them like a jade neck. "I was very busy this time, didn't you come to see you, are you angry?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. I also know that you are very busy. In fact, who is not busy during this time." Catherine turned her head and kissed the man's forehead and sighed. "Mountain rain is coming..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clyester is urging you again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, His Majesty the Pope has come to order me to send troops with the country within a month. Oufu also probably knows that this battle is unavoidable, so simply send the assassins to the three most pro-church churches." I also killed the most important military ministers in the battle. These people are too courageous to dare to assassinate in Wangcheng." There was a chill in the eyes of Queen Catherine. But then he sighed and leaned back in the man's arms behind him. "I'm really scared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man hugged the Queen and said softly, "Oh? We are the king of the 6th largest kingdom in West Asia. Will the hero of the hero, Catherine, feel scared?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, Lancelot and the Knights of the Temple are guarding the old man of Magnus. Naturally, I can sit in the shining castle in a leisurely manner. Fortunately, the old man of Sedros is not the fool of my ministers. If I die, Elasia must be out of control and desperate to attack Oufu and give the church a full control of Ella. The opportunity of West Asia. So he didn't dare to touch me now." Catherine's face was darker. "But they just don't dare not they can. I asked Ou Ling. Ask him if he has the confidence to deal with Oufu's assassination of me. You know what he said. He said that if the general of Oufu is willing to kill me personally, I am <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing he can guarantee is to show his loyalty to me by life. Know that he is the first swordsman of Erasia." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Being able to say such things honestly shows that his loyalty to you is absolutely unquestionable." The man nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Loyalty is valuable but not necessarily able to solve the problem. On the one hand, the great Pope is on the side of the dangerous assassin. My queen is also doing it." I have a pocket." Catherine's tone is more and more mourning, lying in the man's arms like a supple cat. She does not seem to be a queen but a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who embraced this beautiful woman smiled slightly on her forehead and said faintly; "You feel relieved as a loyal testimony to my Queen's love, whether it is the dead old man of Celeste or the wilderness. Small animals will turn into fly ash in the near future. You won't even see it again in your dreams."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the tone of voice, this sentence is completely incomplete. The power and murder is just to say that nature is very gentle and more like a promise to a lover. But even if Queen Catherine heard this sentence, she showed her incredulous expression and looked up at the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man did not speak but just kissed Catherine’s lips again. He reached out and waved all the lights in the air and went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roaring thunder was introduced into the palace, and there was no more arrogant temperament that was drowned by the spring of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately a mile away from the palace. On a tall tower. A man quietly watched the lights in the distant palace go out and gently coughed a few times and looked up and sipped the spirits in his glass. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is getting bigger and bigger, and the mixture of the thunder and the thunder violently tears the night sky into a two-tower tower and trembles in front of the heaven and earth. The wind filled the space in the entire tower. The man turned his gaze from the sleeping palace hidden in the darkness and whispered to the sky like the ink that had just swallowed the lightning. "It is going to change..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The deafening thunder can't cover the man just whispering casually. The face of a man with a sallow face is wearing a leather armor with a long sword and is the collar of the Knights of the Kingdom. The first swordsman of Erasia, General Oling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a middle-aged figure in the tower that is dressed in the robe of the mage, indicating that he is the court magician of the palace of the Erasia. He also looked down in the direction of the palace and asked: "Is the Queen still entertaining the guest? I don't like the guy very much. The last time I saw this guy, the magical smell on his body made me feel annoyed. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't like it either. But Her Majesty the Queen likes it." Ou Ling faintly replied with a glass of wine in his hand and fell from the tall tower. The sound of the landing is drowned in the growing wind. "I believe that there is a reason to like him. We only need to do our guarding work here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician sighed and put the cup The wine is drunk. "Do you think that we can prevent those assassins by the two of us who are good at drinking here? Actually, killing three military ministers overnight, I doubt whether the killer guild has revived..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The level of an assassin is certainly beyond doubt. But the most critical place should be strategy and planning. Oufu has long been the place where the three adults’ habits haunt the place. I feel very clear that this will kill three adults overnight. The most important thing is that the judgment of the identity of the three adults is extremely accurate. It is exactly the three adults who have the most influence on the combat effectiveness of the Kings. Before the blessing, I have been forbearing and not deliberately showing the enemy to weaken. Although I have been wary, I can’t think of this sudden shot or let us be caught off guard.” General Oling sighed and coughed twice. "If you can. I really don't want Elasia to have such an enemy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it not our enemy that we have the final say... "The magician looked out the window of the Queen's bedroom and was completely invisible. There was only the boundless night and the wind that seemed to blow everything away." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can... I really want to see those assassins now. Unfortunately, I didn’t find a day after searching for a day. I don’t know if they will go tomorrow." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician’s eyes narrowed. "You mean that the assassins are still in the king city? They have already succeeded. Why don't they leave? Is it... Who else do they want to kill?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only hope It’s those who should kill.” Ou Ling lifted the bottle and poured the spirits into his throat and coughed a few sallow faces to illuminate an invisible brilliant red in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s another thunder. The raindrops of the beans finally fell in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About two or three miles away from the palace is St. Peter's Basilica. This is the church's largest church in Elazia and the most important base. The Cardinal Escuel is sitting here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
