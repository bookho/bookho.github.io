			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the biggest good news for me this year." Seeing Asa from the transmission line, Oufu's dwarf staff was greatly relieved. He has been walking alone next to the transmission array, and the original bitterness and anxiety have piled up into a big, round bitter gourd. It was only after seeing that the two blue rays of light were shining from the transmission array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden return from the wind and rain of the city of Erasia to the star-studded highland Asa's mood is also one of the loose. Smiled: "A delivery reel can be exchanged for the greatest good news. It seems to be good news in itself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From my point of view In terms of this, from the perspective of Oufu, it is not a good news. Fortunately, if you can bring you back, it will be really a big loss." Bolugan sighed. "These two reels, but Mr. Cedros spent a lot of energy to adopt very strategic means in an extraordinary period. Because the perennial war Elassia is very strict on the control of the transfer of magic scrolls, they think we will have two people The raid on the king city of Elazia. But now they must be aware that even if they don't turn off the magical array to protect the magic array in the future, it is not so easy now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stunned, then I realized that it was not that simple to let Jessica return to Erasia. In order to save me myself, I wasted a reel that might reverse the situation at a critical moment. He himself has to admit that this is probably a bit of a waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You said that I am the biggest good news of the year. Is it better to kill Isfar than the news that I came back?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The death of the Cardinal is certainly good for us but it is far better than the captain of your secret army."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assal proudly said to him: "Look at you like this, I will tell you a good news by the way. When we came back, we slaughtered a court magician called Seia and then General Ou Ling of the Knights of the Kingdom may have a big problem. They actually want to kill them when they chase me. They are not pleasing to the eyes of the Knights of the Temple..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Polugan carefully listened to Asa telling him about the rescue of the female knight. The spirit of the two bulls was shocked, but then they slowly fell silent and finally became a bitter smile: "In the present situation This is really not a good news..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean? Why? I thought you would be very happy when you heard it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whether you hear this message alone, or hear Ace alone I will be very happy about the death of the dead. But the two news together are different." Bolugan sighed that the big face like a biscuit was even more bitter. "Many times. The same nature of things is not just superimposed but also affects each other, that is, not added but multiplied. Two negative numbers are multiplied. That is not a negative number."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Negative number? What does it mean?" Asa frowned at the dwarf in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it’s just a simple death of Bishop Esshir, Queen Catherine should take this opportunity to weaken the church’s power in Erasia, which could have temporarily eased The blessing of the situation, but now the general murder of the Knights of the Temple, the achievement of the Knights has deteriorated the contradiction between the Queen and the Church to the extreme, to the point where a cusp can not be eased. Celeste can never continue to tolerate this situation. The Pope would rather give up It is impossible for Oufu to tolerate an Erasia who betrayed himself. This is also known to Queen Catherine, so Catherine now has only two choices: one is completely with the church and the other is completely obedient to the church.” Bolugan’s adult The big and godly bulls looked at Asa and asked, "Which one do you want Catherine to choose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out to be." Sa thought about it and smiled. Then he asked: "Is the church going to murder the Knights of the Temple for her murder?" "Don't it? They are all political veterans. Can't you see the trend and the relationship? But you have to waste time on these little things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then I have told the identity of Escher that the female knight to let her bring the news back to Celeste. Isn't this useful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I don't know what's the use. I only know that they can never preach this thing everywhere. So even if it's useful, it's probably useless." The Bolugans spread their hands and sighed. "Let's not have to guess them for a while, we still have our own business."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paladin frowned at the pile of small things in front of him, with a silver skull mask and two transport reels. There are two small purple enamel signs on the two ports of the transfer reel, and the faint silver light on the enamel mask shows that it is actually made of dense silver and the craftsmanship and production methods are precise and detailed to the extreme. The magical fluctuations of the past indicate that it is far from being attached with some kind of magic, whether it is a magical item or a treasure, which is invaluable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course its most valuable place is not in itself but in the meaning it represents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These are all found in the hidden places of the room of the Bishop of Ascher and the room. I have specialized in the scroll and the mask. I have been authenticated...all true. There is also this letter." Talis took out a blank piece of paper from her arms and only a few lines of words were apparently not finished. The Knights of the Temple held the paper as if it was very hard. It seemed that the paper was so heavy that even her strength could not be lifted. Her fingers and voices shivered slightly. “The top of the writing to Nopollynot seems to be talking about reducing the amount of donations to the church this year because it requires a lot of magic items to make gargoyles and flesh. I have found a few specials on the letter. The person who identified the handwriting to identify these... does not seem to be forged. It is indeed the handwriting of the adults of Ascher..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot sighed him The two eyebrows wrinkled together and slowly shook their heads and looked at Talis paper. "You know that you are collecting the relics of a cardinal without knowing that this is already your duty." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis did not expect Lancelot to have such a reaction. She quickly said loudly: "But these things are too..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you tell me about these things?" Lancelot said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis answered: "Nothing. These things are really amazing. Too...not a system. I dare not let other people participate in the identification of the handwriting." They only read the words and they didn't know the content of the letter. Now I only know this one by myself. I don't dare to send these things to the referee or directly to the sire. So I will show you first." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are doing very well. Keep in mind these things and these things will never be known to others." Lancelot put away The mask and scroll looked at the unfinished letter and sighed. The white paper that shakes the finger enough to shake the entire church becomes a dusty fine powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...you..." Talis widened her eyes and looked at the Paladin in an incredible way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot looked at his disciple, and his face and voice were the same calm and whispered: "You should also know if these things are from The injury to the entire church by a knight's mouth is not at all comparable to the pagan rumors. This is what the person told you about these intentions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this...this...does these things have to be squatted? The man said...say...Adela Bishop is the same...and the Bishop of Ascher. If that's the case, then it's not very dangerous..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot said faintly: "Do you think you need to remind you?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He knows?" Talis’s expression was more than unbelievable when she saw a mouse swallowing an elephant. She would look at her slowly. teacher. "That means these are really true? And you... I know it too?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I don't know." Lancelot shook his head. "Just guess it. Now you don't know until you say that I really are them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...how is it possible. How can you allow...the Pope Your Majesty... Necromancer..." Talis is incoherent. She is not unable to express her thoughts in words, but she does not even know what she is doing in her head. She was already shocked by herself. Even if the evidence is indeed unquestionable, she is still unbelievable. It's like a child who is not willing to believe in a murderous murderer in his family, even in the face of solid evidence. But now Lancelot's reaction is not only indifferently acknowledged, but the metaphor of this reaction is even more incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guardian of the Bright Church 6 is recognized as the only man who can afford the title of 'Palace of the Knights' and has almost entered the word 'justice'. number. But he knows that the Necromancer is indifferent to the church. And according to his mouth, it is said that it is not just that he himself knows that even the leader of the Pope, the leader of all the big six, is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot naturally saw that his disciples were confused. He didn't explain it directly, but the ink bottle that put his finger into the desk was covered with ink and a thick ink on the table ran across the desk. Then he pointed to the black scratch and asked Talis: "What color is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s black." Talis looked at Lance Lott’s answer to her that she is at a loss is still distinguishable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Lancelot shook his head and said, "No, this is actually a mixture of all colors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Talis nodded. People who don't have to be a special painter and painter with a little common sense know that if you mix the pigments of various colors, they will become a black ink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ball of light mixed with vindictiveness and white magic power floats on his fingers. He asked his apprentice again: "What color is this light?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White light." Talis answered honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. This is a mixture of light of all colors. I have seen it in dwarf artisans if you use a triangular prism to refract a flash of white light. It will be scattered into the seven colors of light. If you gather the seven colors of light together, it will become white."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis looks at Lancelot in vain She seems to feel the meaning of these words but can't be clearly captured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Like this seemingly simple black and white color, the essence of anything is not so simple and good to distinguish each other." Lancelot fingers The ink on the finger was almost instantly disappeared. The white ground ball also dissipated into the air together. His voice and eyes slowly condensed. “It’s very easy and convenient to put everything into a simple concept. It’s a very convenient thing to have a complicated world. It’s a clear sense of security and direction. It’s a pity. It’s not just that the simple concept of good and evil can be solved clearly.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I...I don’t understand.” Talis looked down. Although she can understand the meaning expressed in Lancelot, she is unacceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know you won't understand that even I have used it for ten years to understand." Lancelot smiled a bit. "I understand that there is no absolute justice and a bright existence. Just like the dark night is actually the shadow of the day. The things in the world are interdependently bright and dark, but from a certain point of view, it may be the same thing. Only the darkness will produce light and only the light will create the shadow of darkness. It is inevitable. What we can do is to keep the light as bright as possible while maintaining a relative balance. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, this is impossible. Although the teacher respects you, I absolutely cannot agree with you." Talis suddenly looked up and stared straight at Lan. Sloan. The confusion and confusion in the eyes of the past have been completely steadfast but replaced with a desperate light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot smiled. Say: "I am not teaching you just to tell you what I think. This should be the opinion of the Majesty and the fact is true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible. "Talis's body is shaking. Even more shocking than when she had just found the mask of the Necromancer from the body of Asgar. Although she could not accept the words of her own teacher, she knew that Lancelot would not lie to herself. That is to say, these incredible things really existed and were acquiesced by His Majesty the Pope. For her who has always clearly defined the truth of light and the evil of darkness, this fact is much better than the fact that it is cracked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot looked at Talis training as compassionate. It seems to be watching myself many years ago. "You left Celeste and stayed away from the church for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis shook her head and said, "Now I’m fighting with Oufu. It’s a touch and... I know how these can’t be spit and how can I leave.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “These things don’t matter, they already exist. It is because you know that you can't accept it, but it will give you trouble. I know that you can't hide these things in your heart, but if you disclose them, you probably know what you are. Most people are still unable to accept these facts like you.” Lancelot shook his head and said, “The war with Oufu is now lost. Your faith has been shaken and it’s useless. Your talent. In fact, it is very good that even those who are under your strength can't beat you. Do you know why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
