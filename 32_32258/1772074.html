			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no wine in the city of Oufu. The food is not enough to be used to make such a luxury item and the magical effect of this drink is too strong for the impulsive orcs, so even foreign businessmen are not allowed to bring the wine into the city. This is a huge regret for the thieves. According to their current high spirits, the result of the must-have wine is to be happy. Only the mushy food is still eaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But tomorrow morning they took the goods back to the empire and there was no shortage of wine. Just imagine the gold coins that are about to get started. This is something that is hard to swallow. It seems that there is also the noble taste of the apple juice stewed lamb chops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa was honored as a great contributor to the success of this operation. After all, it is extraordinary that the super-criminal sects who have seen the big scenes and can seduce a noble lover are indeed extraordinary. If it is not because of his calm words and attitudes at the crucial time of yesterday, let everyone calm down, it goes without saying that the owner of the goods has probably become the feed purchased by the animal farm. And today, in such a tense scene, it is also comfortable. After the goods came back, he went to the officials who had said a lot of words. Many thieves thought that he was negotiating and hoped to be able to divide the goods again. However, it seems that the face after he came back is not very smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa completely ignored the high spirits of the thieves and perfunctored them and returned to the room after a few meals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent an afternoon in the middle of the middle-aged people asking about the entanglement and finally knowing the city of Cedros and Gru The generals lived together in the residence of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the tone of the city of Cedros, he knows what the book is. Nature can't directly reach out to someone who is almost equal to telling others that they are dead guilds. No matter what kind of person is unwelcome to the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his current identity is a professional thief. A professional thief suddenly showed out the appointment of the bishop and the duke. This is the first thing that comes to mind is forgery. If you catch a few thieves to torture, you will know that there is still a token of robbing the imperial minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to think about the result or think that it is most convenient to solve the problem in the way that I am best at it. I will leave tomorrow. Asa felt that maybe she was really a thief. No matter what kind of situation you deal with, you are fighting to kill, not stealing or robbing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is going back tomorrow?" Xiao Yan looked at his notes in front of the bed in the light. The kerosene here is a red flame that burns from the fat of the cattle that are hunted from the lizard swamp. She seems to be very absent-minded, occasionally turning aside the notes and turning to the lights. "Do we really want to go back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Asa sat down in the corner. There was a pile of hay there, where he slept. Now it is necessary to keep the spirits deep in the night and then go to steal books. He has a unique way of sleeping in the wild, as long as he thinks about when he wants to wake up at that time, a spirit can wake up. And as long as you want to sleep, you can fall asleep almost at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there really sleeping?" Xiaoxuan looked at Asa and sat there and asked. The fire that burned the fat of the bull is red and her face is also very red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Asa leaned on the hay and prepared to close his eyes. The night vision of the werewolf is unmatched by humans. Although the law and order here is already very good, there are still werewolves patrolling the streets every night. This is the biggest obstacle to stealing books. It is necessary to wake up to the spirit of twelve points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the lights in Asa’s eyes are flashing. She said: "Although I know that I must go back, I don't really want to go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa closed his eyes and asked, "Why?" It’s good to let the workshop in this city not be closed, but the other beasts have already gone to rest, let the sound of the workshop cover up their own. It is impossible to lurk forward in this city without revealing it in a completely quiet situation. Some werewolves can even hear the breathing sounds of people within a hundred meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After turning to the oil lamp, I took a long breath and seemed to accumulate a lot of strength. Then I said softly: "I will get married soon after I go back." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa’s eyes opened and looked at Xiaoyan. He remembered that she did have a fiancé in Wangdu. Sudden sense of loss suddenly rushed over and washed away everything that was being thought of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is going back to get married. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But think about it, isn’t this something you already know? And it seems that it is not a matter of her own. This is the thing of her princess, she seems to find no reason to insert a foot in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how good the relationship between others and you is actually an occasional fellow traveler on the road of life, they always have their own way to go. This is what the old adventurer of the village once said to him. He always felt very reasonable. And he has already decided what path he wants to take. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing that once owed her to her conscience has also been made up. After this matter has been settled here, I will travel around alone. And she is still the princess, naturally there is something the Duke should do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This truth is very perfect. Even the higher philosophers can't have a higher level of explanation, but Asa still has a feeling of embarrassment. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dry monsoon of the wilderness is blowing in the face and the beat of the ear with the smell of coke and iron is gradually clear. The artisans and the orc apprentices in the streets where the workshops are gathered are working hard. Asa suddenly remembered that his hometown had come to Suizhong. He suddenly missed the food his father prepared for him when he came home occasionally. He felt that the freedom of a person was not so good for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now is not the time to think about it. Crossing the street of this workshop is the city hall. The city of Cedros and the general of Gru live near that afternoon. He has already inquired very clearly. Assad has fixed his mind to remind himself that it is indeed not a cranky occasion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this street, Asa began to be careful. The front is already silent. The air of the wild land is very clean. Even if there is no moon at night, you can see the outline of the tall city hall in front of you with the stars. He crept past the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but since she is already married, why should she run out? It is said to remove the backpack in the swamp but if you think about it, you should know that it is impossible to pick it up. Do you want to come out and play around? Why come to me? I like her, she likes me too,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly a strange smell envelopes the whole body. This is a bit like the mixture of urine and armpits but the impact on the nose is a hundred times more intense. This is a unique smell of carnivores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This odor immediately awakens the bloody feelings and fears of Asa’s deepest memory. In the lizard swamp, when it is closest to death, the nose is full of this smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked up and there were two green and small balls in the low light. The breath of the werewolf's mouth was spitting on his face and he almost slammed into the wolf's arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two legs are completely out of his control and arbitrarily slammed the body's power back. But before he landed, he slammed into a furry body and both hands fell completely into the grip of a pair of huge claws. That scent is even more intense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The werewolf behind him, like a human being, has framed his arms like a child who just walked so that his feet can just land. It can be felt that the hot air exhaled from the wolf population is slowly flowing from the ear to the neck and slipping into the clothes. The fighting spirit of the past has disappeared. He almost felt that he could immediately hear the bones of his hands broken into pieces. The sound tension and fear immediately stiffened every inch of the muscles of the body. He could not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former werewolf approached and buried his face almost together with Asa’s face to smell the stench and food feedback that remained in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The werewolf spoke up because of the mouth shape that made them say that the human language was quite strenuous. It said slowly and awkwardly: "Humans don't go around at night. Here Don't approach in the evening." The faint fangs can be seen in a vague way with the words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s full-armed, stiff neck nodded. Then the two werewolves mentioned him like a child. The street was laid down in the direction of the hotel and turned and disappeared into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa slowly walked toward the hotel in the direction of the hotel, sweating down the cheeks down the big stalks and dripping the vests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
