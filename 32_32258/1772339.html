			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the elf little lover of Akibad, they always seem to believe that the world tree leaves and the sun well are the power to deal with the edge of the end. However, it seems to me that this is not the case. After all, although the essence of power between the two can be regarded as the opposite, the level of power is not the same. To some extent, the power of suppressing the sword should be ok, but to restrain, then It’s absolutely impossible.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long while, Asa took a long breath and stood up and nodded to Moriel and said, “Thank you. Tell me this. I finally know what is going on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This breath is really long, at least for a couple of years. No matter how you adjust your mind, you dare to take responsibility, but it is not easy to be happy when you know that these responsibilities are not at all responsible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially this is easy before the death, it makes people feel relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This happened so much that he was confused and confused, so he made up his mind to ask Moriel to say everything. But when Moriel really said it, Asa regretted it and regretted yelling at the ill-tempered Black Dragon. He regretted the phrase 'dispose of you'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things really can't be known to others. Since she said it, she probably would kill herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not think about running away and resisting, but from the strength of Black Dragon’s performance, he also knew that he had no chance at all. The black dragon that has fully recovered its strength seems that even Akibad is not an opponent. Instead of vain rebellion, it is better to calm down and listen to the news of this life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know what happened to the old man of Sandru if he heard these words? Asa imagined his reaction and some wanted to laugh. Unfortunately, it seems that he is inaudible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aiyi has care for Talis, it should be no problem. Xiao Yan... She is so capable, she doesn't have to worry about herself, Sandron, Ai's mother-in-law... They also don't need people to worry about themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis... This stupid girl, if there is a chance, then apologize to her. It’s true that she didn’t follow me... I thought it was a little uncomfortable in Asa’s heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Asa waited for a while, and Moriel still lingered on the Golden Mountain. There was no sign of standing up and slapping him into a patties or a bit of a dragon to turn him into a fly ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How? Don't you kill me?" Asa couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? Do you want to die?" Morrier replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You tell me these don't kill me... I'm not afraid of telling other Necromancers about these things... I won't be able to finish again from now on. The meditation man comes to me, and your seal is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I decided not to tell you, since I decided to tell you." Long sighed, and the voice was no longer as heavy as ever. "Actually, I probably won't live for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Asa stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A long time I got rid of the life and soul in the blood, in fact, I have already reached the limit. Especially the last battle, almost has let I am really dead. If you have a brand of dark stars on your body, it might be better to get rid of some of the seals, but now... I can still be up to two or three years."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There have been no people in the past five hundred years, and do you expect to appear in two or three years? If these things die with me, no one knows, it is not fair to Akibad... ...especially your later idiots don’t understand him at all...so I won’t kill you.” Moriel smiled at Asa, although the smile on the face of the dragon looked more than the face of most beasts. Oh, but there is some kindness in it, this is a real smile. "That again, you have saved my life. Although it is only two or three years of life, I still want to thank you. You really think that the dragon is without feelings, do not know the grateful Dede guys."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
