			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black elf slowly woke up in the prison. Her whole body has been soaked by her own cold sweat and she is soaked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, she is not so awake because she has always been sober, but all her consciousness has been completely overwhelmed by the unimaginable pain. In addition to the pain in the brain, it is pain. It seems that there are a thousand knives that are immersed in the fire and smashed in the flesh on the bones to scrape the nerves and muscles. However, this has already passed the sensory impact of the nerve and the limit of consciousness, but it can't make her faint. It is like a person who is being opened by the throat and is filled with countless red-hot charcoal. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finger is broken, but the damage is not very serious. Now it is not very painful under the effect of white magic. It was just that under the influence of those magics, this magnified the pain of a hundred times and completely lost her self-control ability. Jessica had to break the confession of torture and know that the bloody means and the high-tech ratio are indeed pediatrics. She can't imagine someone who can't give in without being able to stun in such extreme limits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she can surrender, she has already succumbed. But the purpose of the person who tortured her is not her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man on the ground who has suffered her pain is now lying calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This git. It hurts me badly." Jessica kicked a kick on Asa's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assass on the ground did not reflect that it only trembled with the feet of the Black Elves. Jessica quickly and steadily stretched out the hand that was still intact and pressed it around his neck. But Jessica immediately screamed and shook her hand back. She felt like she had touched a red iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if this is my own illusion or a problem left by the previous magic. Jessica’s clothes on Asa’s body seem to slowly The change cotton clothes actually began to slowly deform the zoom. Then peeled off from his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica still doesn't understand what's going on. The temperature of the cell has gradually risen a lot without knowing it, and the center of this temperature is here. Asa, lying on the ground, seems to have turned into a burning charcoal to bake the entire basement. She carefully reached the end of his nose and felt his breath. Although the airflow he breathed was almost the same as that in the blast furnace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Asa himself didn’t know all about it. He only felt a little bit of warmth now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to get rid of the current dilemma, he knows that the only hope is to use meditation. But when he was fully motivated, he was completely immersed in this unprecedented experience. Because his current mood and state of mind are unprecedented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human heart and human emotions are really wonderful things. Some things you may already have have some truths. You may have already understood them. But you must have enough emotions to enrich your heart before you can truly integrate with what you know. The power of emotional tempering is the source of a mature person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s current mood is still sad and helpless. But these emotions are no longer boiling in the mind and chest as they started. After he completely accepted these things, they slowly cooled down and calmed down. Precipitating into the deepest part of emotions When a person's emotions are deeper, the more things he can carry, the more things he can face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa was able to move meditation to this point for the first time. He can now feel that it is not just ** but also his own spiritual feelings and heart. These are not the separation of the body. It can even be said that this should be a deeper and more basic thing in the body. Every minute is sad and angry. The most subtle emotions are integrated with the muscles and nerves. This is the fusion of heart and **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know whether it’s from the depth of spiritual consciousness or from every cell in the body. Asa can see a warm golden light gradually enveloping himself and slowly re-soaking into the soul of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used to experience this kind of light long ago, knowing that this should be something lurking in his body but has never felt it again until this time seems to be I finally reached an opportunity in the spirit. With the help of meditation, he finally saw it again and was completely captured. He only felt a warmth. This warmth is not soft. It is not the kind of safe and gentle warmth that is soaked in the mother's abdomen. It is a bit hot and dry like the raging sun in the wilderness. Although rough, it is full of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica, who was in the cell, had already retreated to the corner of the cell and was terrified but looked at Asa on the ground with concern. The clothes on her hand had been taken off and the sweat on her body was all screwed to Asa. She even tried to stick to him to dissipate the terrible temperature but almost burned the skin off her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the burning things in Asa’s body have been turned into ashes. The entire basement has been turned into an oven by the temperature that has been released from his body. But he himself seems to be more and more calm, without seemingly uncomfortable face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally his body shines brightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the underground prison of the cathedral, Bishop Javi, who had been closing his eyes and meditation, opened his eyes. His eyes were on the deepest wall of the prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now, the feeling that he has been relying on meditation to suffer and screaming suddenly appeared. The look he looked at the wall was an incredible surprise: "Sure enough here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis in the Cathedral just crossed the guards outside. Forcibly rushed into the cathedral and he rushed to the underground entrance where the god had been removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inham?" Ryan’s great priest saw him in front of the Marquis. "The bishop of the bishop ordered that no one be allowed to enter here. When did you come back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis has no calm and calm face in his face at this time. Being anxiously smashed out of murderousness and smashing his body shape, he must avoid the obstruction of the great priest: "Get out of the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan’s priest also followed him. One. Still stopped in front of him. Although it is the priest of the School of Magic. But even from his own body, Ryan didn't even lose to the captains in the Paladin. He is a recognized magic school, and the first person under the bishop of Ronis will not be designated to temporarily manage the School of Magic. But now he feels amazed because his man has barely been able to stop the guy who seems to have no strength in his usual time. He can use his full strength to stop at the entrance of the tunnel: "What are you doing? Here is the School of Magic. This is the order of the bishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Marquis pushed him away and screamed: "I am following the command of His Majesty the Pope. There are hundreds of thousands of fires. The matter is to tell Bishop Jia Wei that you are going to go out and block others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well? His Majesty the Pope..." Ryan’s sergeant was just a glimpse. The Marquis has already rushed into the tunnel and disappeared. He measured it and sighed and walked quickly to the door of the cathedral. Although the Marquis is somewhat unbelievable, it is not entirely impossible. And during this time he was not sure about the future of the School of Magic. In the event of the fact that Celeste really took back the control of the Magic Academy...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Bishop Jawi in the underground prison is carefully scrutinizing the cold wall of the dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall is full of wet moss, but the expression of Bishop Javey is both amazing and satisfying: "There are so many institutions set up. The illusion-specialist* has arranged a permanent and continuous mirroring magic. No, I didn’t see the clue last time... but this time it was the right place.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He took two steps back and took out the sword. The whispering mourning of the prayer adds to himself all the auxiliary white magic that can be attached. At the same time, there is also a grudge on the body. Although this organ is very clever, it can be destroyed as long as it is destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he raised his sword and condensed his power to sway, there was a broken drink behind him: "Stop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Jia Wei turned his head and saw that the expression in the crowd was very strange. "Is it you? What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Of course it is preventing you from doing stupid things." The Marquis is cold. "Do you know what you are doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course. Is there anything wrong with getting back to something that belongs to the Descartes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s that Vidnina tells you about it. I don’t think she will actually ask you to find this thing. She just uses you, don’t you understand?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is not using who? The teacher taught me to practice complete real meditation and her lifelong knowledge so that my strength can be thousands of miles. I promised to help her do something outside. This is fair."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Jia Wei snorted: "Weird. As a member of the Descartes Valley, the necromancer who inherits the will of the great Akibad. It is a natural book to retrieve this thing for the great Dark Star. Do you want to stop as a proxy president?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who can dare to really understand the prophecy of Lord Aquibad? Everyone is in accordance with The meaning is to understand that you are only driven by your own **." Marquis screamed: "In short, I do not allow you to touch this thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No? It is impossible to disallow the identity of the acting president. You know what this is. As a Necromancer, it is already the upper limit. Do you want to change the rules of the guild that lasted for five hundred years?" Jia Wei The bishop no longer looked at the Marquis, but raised the sword and volleyed a sword and slammed into the wall with a fierce and unparalleled light on the wall of the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bang in the dungeon and the whole dungeon shook a bit. But after the stone chips splashed. There is only a shallow mark on the opposite stone wall. If you don't look at it, you can't see it. When the sword is hitting the stone wall, you can see that there are countless looming magic symbols around the stone wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Jia Wei was surprised to see the shallow traces on the wall. He knows how powerful his sword is, even if it is a granite hill, the sword can be crushed. However, the magic runes that appeared on the stone wall at that moment made him understand that he was in the right place. "It is actually the mixed guardian enchantment of the white magic's top seal and the suppression of the black magic's chaos. And most of the power of this enchantment is to suppress the things inside... This must be the joint efforts of Sandro and Ronis. It’s already possible to make sure that there’s something behind it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’m talking about stopping, can’t you hear?” The Marquis’s voice was cold and cool. Such as the blade. The same cold and sharp, there is the silky smell from his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound and momentum also caused Jawi’s bishop’s movement to stop suddenly. He slowly turned to look at the Marquis’ expression and the voice was also cold: “You rely on What do you want me to stop?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis did not answer just looking at Bishop Javey with that cold look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you rely on? By yours is the guild acting president?" The voice of Bishop Jia Wei became a somewhat mocking tone. "Or say. You are my father?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter which kind you just know that you have to stop." The Marquis replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I don't stop?" Bishop Jia Wei said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will let you stop." The Marquis voice is still cold. Although this sentence seems to be no different from the previous one, the implied accent of individual words still indicates his meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long silence, Bishop Javey smiled very slyly and smiled at the long sword in his hand and said, "Okay. I know this time I stopped. Because I know you." If I really want to let me stop, I really can't stop it. But when I have the opportunity and ability, I will definitely come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I am for your good. Don't you know? I am your father, will I still hurt you?" Marquis frowned. His voice was as fierce as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry to tell the truth, I always think that I don't have a father." Bishop Jia Wei suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis stunned and looked a little bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a long silence, Bishop Jia Wei reversed his body and turned to the Marquis and said slowly: "Do you know? I have been resentful since I started thinking. A father who can do at least a decent. Even my mother is no one who knows. Anyone knows that my father is not knowing how many sons and daughters are in the big 6 but he just took me back. The family announced that I was his only son... I don't know if this is good luck in the eyes of others. But at least for me, I would rather not be quiet than at least I can still live. He threw me a full It’s the world of dreams and **, but only gives me a status that I’ve been spurned and rejected. Since I’m sensible, I’m living in the sneer and disdain of people in the family, so I’m desperately looking for opportunities to climb up. One can overlook everything including the top of this father..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
