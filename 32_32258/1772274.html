			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talisley’s embarrassing wave of excuses: “This is not because there is a very important task to follow this...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't need to explain this to me." The Tamik Knight said that the sound was dry like wood. "I don't want to know what you are doing. Just leave them alone and don't get in the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a mission?" Talis. She understands that the Knights of Tamik and his Templars will generally only be dispatched under the orders of His Majesty the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have to know this. Let's go." Tamik said this to Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to roll? Didn't learn. It's better to show me first." Asa looked at him and sneered. He knows that this should be a person who prefers to kill people with a knife instead of threatening people with words. Now it is already obvious that he is talking to him. It is to explain that he also has scruples and is not sure. Not sure that they can do what they want to do under their own interference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge green hustle in the midair has been swaying. The flashes and roars of the magical bombings continually illuminate the green carapace fragments and juices on its huge body. The hustle and bustle of the hustle and bustle has never stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luya constantly uses the leaves of the world tree to put the restoration magic of the natural system into the body of the cockroach on the back of the cockroach, but the vitality of the cockroach is still in the roar Lapse. The magical power of the elements of dozens of magicians is enough to flatten a mountain. If it wasn't for Master Aiden's warning, they should be careful that the elf above would prevent the magic from blowing up the elf and the leaves of the world tree. Even if it was made of stainless steel, it would have been left without residue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a dispelling or purifying scene in the natural magic, it will not be so embarrassing. Maybe it is the magicians. This huge war is alive and well, and it has been slowed down by countless curses to reduce agility and flexibility before being used as a living target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? Is there a Pegasus Knight?" A magician suddenly saw a winged Pegasus figure in the distance moving closer to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This winged Pegasus does not seem to be afraid of the magic that flies around here. Instead, the person rushed over and waved his hands and shouted: "Everyone is going to stop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lightning strikes from the center of a magician. The Pegasus Pegasus screamed and fell into the middle of the forest. The man who was yelling also fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the elf ghost?" The old magician who took out the lightning glared at the murky eyes and frowned at the man and the horse. Said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the elf is not an individual. There is one there." A magician with a better eye next to him pointed to another winged Pegasus approaching here. I looked at it with my eyes open. "There seems to be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A terrible screaming war, finally struggling to struggle with a huge scythe forefoot to avoid a magician It was made into a mass of meat sauce. At the same time, the abdomen, which had been scarred, was hit by both Aydin Master's two thunderbolts and a water system's ice skate. The wars and sap in the sky were cut off for the two huge bodies to finally fall from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not my opponent." The Tamik Knight looked at Asa. He still looks like a statue like a statue, and he can’t see it. Instead, the long black knife on the hand seems to be struggling with a ghost-like bloodthirsty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not for me. I know." Asa also looked at the Tamik Knight. He admits this, but the gap between the two is not big. The other party knows this too, so he talks to him like this instead of cutting it up in half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two Templars sandwiched him from the back. Although these two are not very high masters, it is enough to assist the Tamik Knight from behind. Talis was somewhat overwhelmed and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will say it again. Or I will kill you. His Majesty the Pope only said to Lancelot that you want to live. But did not tell me. Anyone who is obstructing me from doing things will die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want to do it. He can see that this person is not very good at dealing with it. It’s not just the feeling of getting along with it, but the ability to assassinate Bishop Esshir is enough to make it difficult for him to complete the task of the Pope’s Majesty. So if you are not sure, you can try words or anything else to let him not let him get in the way. . But since suddenly there is a perfect opportunity. Then he will certainly not let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only dead people are the most unreliable dead and most reliable. This reason has already been branded in the mind of the Tamik Knight, so when the opponent's momentum is loose, he almost subconsciously shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his strength to prevail the situation is also his prevail. This slamming blow seems to have no unreasonable reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no earth-shattering momentum in this knife, but the air is filled with a faint scent of death. Even the smell of rotten rot that was mixed with the fire of the Necromancer was completely different from this one. It was not pungent, and it was natural to penetrate into the marrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a loud roar of a big tree. It’s not broken or broken, it’s rotten. Just like the burning scent, even if its shape can not be maintained, it will fall silently into a broken piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is smashed into the end, as well as Asa’s clothes from the chest to the lower abdomen. He can clearly understand how the vindictiveness and magical power of this knife are. The sleek and deep sea and the amazing power of the killing of the singularity of the body from the Paladin's close-fitting soft armor like a piece of rotten paper in this rubbing directly into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s just a brushing of Asa’s side-by-side flashing just to escape the knife of the Tamik Knight. The knife just wiped him around in a millimeter and then smashed a big tree not far behind, but did not hit him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?" The Thamik Knight’s face, which seemed to have been sloppy, was completely occupied by the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this knife is caught, he won’t. Despite the excellent chance of a blow, he also knows that the strength of this opponent is not enough. This is a sudden blow. He wants to directly defeat him. It is a rush between the rush and the initiative to take the lead and take the initiative. Do not let him kill the opportunity to use Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the other party is completely dodging. It is almost unimaginable for a player of such a level to lock the object's blow. It’s not just the knife that is not empty. It’s the imposing skill to judge the killing and the spirit. Only when there is a gap in strength, can it be completely dodged, otherwise it’s only parry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This opponent is not simple, but its own strength can never do this step. The only explanation is that this opportunity is not a real opportunity or an opportunity for his opponent but an opportunity for his opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the knife has actually occupied the full advantage of the momentum, but the Asa has not taken the opportunity to shoot Tamik. I turned and ran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tulis seems to be impossible to play in any way, and it seems impossible to help himself and the other side has two templars. Like Tamek, Asa never thought about playing from the beginning. He didn't want to solve or drive away the other. He wanted to run. Just rush to the elves to help them or let them. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s no different if the person like the Knight of the Tamik is ready to run away and send the neck directly. Therefore, Asa only pretends to be tempted to seduce the other side and prepares to escape. This is the best escape opportunity. The Tamik Knight’s knife has just pulled out and he can’t get into the forest with just two leaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that it’s not enough to escape like this. Asa still has a big sigh: “Talis good wife dragged them to me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s the story, the Tamek Knight and the two Templars are just amazed at the maids who are very wary and look at the female knight’s own I almost jumped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You two stopped me." The Knights of Tamik just chased the back of Asa with a single sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamik rushed out of the two Templars without any precautions, and at the same time slammed the sword in the income sheath and pulled it out to seal Tali. wire. Although they are also very difficult to believe in this matter, but the two are together is the fact that it is also a fact to remind each other and parry each other. They can't help but have this possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
