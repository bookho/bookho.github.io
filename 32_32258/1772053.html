			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of blood in front of the beach, like a few barrels of blood spilling on the ground, some of the middle of the corpse that is not in the shape of a human being The weapons and armor fragments of the ** should be the cavalry that has been following. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bodies are not crushed like the corpses of rats that have been run by countless horses in the downtown road. They are rags and rags. . The blood was squeezed out by the deformed torso and painted a large piece of scarlet on the ground. This strange death has already come out of the experience of Asa. He can't think of how these soldiers died to die like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Careful attention to the situation around it seems that there are no traces left by other animals or people. Only a few dead trees are seen with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of dead tree is very common in this forest. There are a few trees at every other distance and not as tall as other ancient trees. It’s only five or six people. There are no branches and leaves. There are only a lot of vines wrapped around them. The thick and big branches are a bit like human hands and feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of careful look at the Asa only these dead trees are really a bit of a human shape, although the length is not the same, but there are four hands and feet The main branch of the root is covered with blood and stands quietly there. It is very strange and bloody. But this is really just a tree. Asa did not feel the breath of any living things in the silence around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always no tree to move and kill. He frowned and shook his head and squatted down to look at the twisted bodies to see if they could find out more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing sounds Asa just suddenly felt that the air behind it was too late to turn around and look at the ribs and tightened himself. He looked down and saw a few branches with the thickness of his wrist bent over his waist and all the blood was still dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead tree behind him is holding him with the same hand and lifting it up. The other hand-shaped branch is going in an applauding posture. close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa hurriedly pulled the two branches of the waist and smashed the branches and smashed the hands and smashed the hands and forced them to break out of the branches and jumped to the ground. The applause broke out with a muffled sawdust. As long as he moves slowly, he will become a puzzled body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa was frightened to see that this has become a giant of human common sense. This is definitely a tree but it is definitely moving. It is not so much the dead tree of the human form, but the giant body of the dead tree. The bodies of the scattered soldiers are picked up by these huge pieces of wood like the people. The roots of the tree are also full of blood. Asa also understands how the complete bodies can be flattened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa turned back and wanted to run, and now he is surrounded by three such trees. He didn't care that the silent trees actually came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of a sudden bang in the distance completely shattered the silence of the entire forest. The green fire is looming in the shadows of the dark forest. It was still noon, but the sky was unknowingly dim. Like the dusk in the rain, the shadows of the trees covered with blood were scattered and dead and re-solidified into a strange and extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked up and looked at the sun that was shining. Now there is only a golden ring. The black shadow in the middle blocks most of the light. This is rare. A golden eclipse at first sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a more violent explosion. Several tree people don’t know from which part a low-pitched tweet and the roots of the foot are moving in the direction of the sound. Going to ignore the Asa on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked at the tree man’s distance and suddenly turned to think that this might be a good opportunity. The sound of the sound and the green fire should be the masterpiece of the red robe. Maybe he is also against this monster. Although he does not know what the purpose of the red robe is into the forest and the purpose is more or less related to his own goal, perhaps he is also for the 'leaf of the world tree'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This forest is definitely not just daunting, so the one that hides the 'world tree leaf' is definitely not the same as the fruit in the orchard. Can bring it back. It’s better to follow the past than to look around and maybe you can still fish in troubled waters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was taken away by this probably the strangest mount in the world. Asa saw a few people who were burnt into a pile of black carbon and the pieces that were blown up and broken. Broken zombies. Sure enough, it is a masterpiece of the red robe. Around the beginning, I saw the new tree people moving toward the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around the tree gathered more and more and looked as if the entire forest was moving. Not far away, I saw the sawdust in the explosion, and the air was flying around. The green flame suddenly exploded like a grand fireworks in front of it. The silence of the forest’s original silence has long since disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great pace of the tree people crossed the Asa and saw the group of zombies and red robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red robe is undoubtedly the absolute protagonist of this spectacular scene. The whole battle is carried out around him. More than a hundred zombies surrounded him in the middle of protection. He sometimes waved a little green fire and flew to the tree. The whole tree was swallowed into the violent flame and became a pile of coke and sometimes throwing a light. The ball exploded with a deafening explosion that shattered the tree. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall man under the tall man has some white horses and some sharp-eared people attacking the zombies and the red robes. The white horses had a sharp one-corner in the center of their forehead. Asa heard in the mouth of the old adventurer that it should be a beast that the unicorn can only see in the most primitive and pure forest. Those who are sharp-eyed should be the elves. When they are in their hometowns, they often hear that the dwarves have mentioned that the races and humans that only live in the forest are almost the same as humans. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elves, regardless of whether men and women are all physically and mentally jumping in the middle of the tree, holding a longbow to shoot the red robe, and some magical. It’s just that the zombies beside the red robe are rushing to use their bodies to withstand these arrows and magic can be hit on the red robe. Although the red robes seem to want to kill these elves as much as possible, they all jump agilely from one tree to another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unicorn spurs zombies with the horns on the head. Once it was picked up by the sharp corners of white light and thrown away, the zombies were immediately smashed like a broken puppet. The tree people use huge hands and feet to crush and squeeze the zombies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of zombies is decreasing and the reinforcements on the elves are constantly accumulating around. The hands of the red robe kept screaming and the flames were getting denser and denser, but the degree of increase of the tree was still over the number of fallen. The people around the red robe were completely drowned by the tree. It seems that the outcome has been fixed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa suddenly appeared in front of this fierce battle group with a scene that is inconsistent with this atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several rocks with rocks on the ground bulge up and down in a circle in the middle of a circle of clear springs. Three green leaves float on the water and a naked elf girl stands in the middle of the spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl in the water with her hands in her arms and her head closed her eyes and did not move a silvery long hanging down and her beautiful ** scented gloss mixed for a lifetime There is only beauty that does not dare to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then his attention was immediately drawn to the three leaves floating on the water. Beyond this far, he couldn't see what the leaves were. He could only feel the kind of green that shocked the mind like the green of the world's business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be a unique and independent picture. I don’t care about the fierce battle that is going on next to me. I am there to show my quiet beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loud bang almost shocked Asa in the gods. The tree next to the tree was blown by the light ball and the airflow was mixed with wood chips and it was burning on his face. He was only aware that the tree he was in had joined the battle group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just thought of getting sneaked down to the body and tightening the vines of Asa’s tree. I don’t know when I was wrapped around my waist and tied him to my waist. The tree is on the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original uninterrupted explosion and the slamming of the flame suddenly disappeared. Instead, the red robe was like a ghost. The poetry of the poem shouted: "The dragon of darkness sleeping in the crack of time"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa began to stalk the vines on his body but these vines How soft and tough is also pulling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves in the ground suddenly accelerated the attack. The magic and arrows poured into the red robe, but all of them were blocked by the zombies and rotten flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I summon you in the name of darkness and destruction" The red robe continued to sing under the cover of zombies, and a huge shadow, if nothing, began in the air. Condensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vine is still wrapped around the waist as if it is getting tighter and tighter. Asa began to panic. Now the red robe is casting a spell. He doesn't know, but he knows that the caster is inversely proportional to the caster's level and magic intensity. Since even the people in the red robe should slowly sing and sing in order to display them, it will definitely not be the flame that burned the trees. The tree man under his own feet is still trying to get closer to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please show your strength in this world." The roar of the red robe stopped. The shadow gradually became clear in the air. The lizard-shaped huge body was covered with green scales. There was a pair of huge wings on the back. This is the illusion of a cyan dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just an illusion. This huge body does not hinder the tree's offensive tree. People are constantly waving their hands and feet zombies under the illusion. But when the illusory dragon stretched his neck and looked up, the surrounding air was suddenly brought to the place where it should be a void, and the turbulent airflow even pulled the wood chips on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa made a fireball at his waist, and he had to get out of these vines. The elves on the ground have completely given up the offense and all gathered together to prop up a white light curtain. The unicorn began to flee everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fireball hit the Asa body and the vines were finally broken. Asa was surprised to see one thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tree man’s courageous advancement has brought him under the dragon's mouth. He can even feel that the air inside is condensing and rolling with huge magical power. One. It’s too late to escape. He decided to gamble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the dragon reached the highest point and inhaled and stopped the airflow to calm down in the air. The battlefield that was just noisy was suddenly restored to the original silence of the forest. Almost all the movements stopped. Only the trees left were still silently waving their hands to the zombies still standing up for the red robe. The lonely ping-pong sounded off the ominous prelude in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon suddenly slammed his head in a dashing position around the dead green flame of a corpse like a flood that has been gathering for hundreds of years. From the mouth of the dragon squirting out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a moment when everything is drowned in the raging green flames of the ocean. The tall trees are just touching the flames that contain magic like wax The molten iron that was topped with red was just a flash, and it immediately disappeared. It seems that even the residue is reluctant to stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon turns its body and shakes the green and blue waves of the head and neck. It spreads unscrupulously around and sweeps away all the touched things and even the sound. The whole world only has the roar of the dragon mouth spit out the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that for a century, the dark green flame is no longer ejected from the mouth of the dragon. The illusion of the dragon is like a low-pitched sound. The image gradually fades away and slowly dissipates in the air as it slowly condenses. The green flame also faded with the disappearance of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things have disappeared. The zombie tree man, the unicorn, and the grassy ground around the towering old trees, even the traces of their existence have not Leaving a few hundred meters in a square is completely a blackened open space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red robes standing in the middle of this scorched earth are struggling to make a ghostly gasp. This magic almost drains all his mana. However, all obstacles have been eliminated. He looked ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but not far from the front, the spring water is still still so clear and transparent, the leaves are still green, so lifeless, the girls continue to quietly close their heads. The eyes stand there. This scene still seems to have nothing to do with all the changes around it, but stands alone in this deadly scorched earth. The magical flame that destroyed everything just did not hurt the points here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the red robe is not surprised as if this is expected or even expected. He smiled smugly as if several hundred dying wolves were working hard together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
