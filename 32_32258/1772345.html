			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death of Tima's high priest did not cause much of a storm in Oufu. The orc did not have a big priest for the Tauren priest who was about to join. What impression, only Basil led all the people to see the rotted body of the Tema High Priest and the Knights of the Temple, and then everyone almost forgot this little thing. The Tauren and the harpy joined in, preparing for the battle that began with the handover, and the establishment of the stronghold in the Sandefes Mountains. All things were brought together, and the whole Oufu began to work like a huge machine. Run it up. No one has any idlers and kung fu to manage what has happened. Although the total population of Oufu is not large, even the population of a city in Elasia is far better than it, but the orc's ability to be strong can have the most reasonable scheduling, and the efficiency is still amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the day, Bolu adults felt that they were almost scattered. He never felt that his head was so heavy, so big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can’t wait to cut it down on the table to relax my neck and body. He is responsible for the most effective manpower and resources of the entire Oufu team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dispatch, use, so that a very manpower can make 15 points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in a special chair and putting his head on the table, Bolugan’s eyebrows stretched his eyelids and flipped through various reports and books. Kinds of data, human resources, means of use, time, materials, etc. fly and smash in his head, blend, test each other, negation, affirmation... Finally, the combination of each other results in a very efficient result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three oil lamps on the table. The fat of the bulls makes the flame of the oil lamp shine like a torch. The whole house is illuminated. It is already late at night. He does not want to sleep, but he is reluctant to sleep. More calculations are more detailed, planning is more reasonable, and work efficiency can be greater tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new, struggling city in the bottom-up red, with infinite vitality and potential, has no power politics and people s things. The pressure of survival makes it impossible for everyone to be distracted. Even if you are tired, you can see your efforts to achieve results. Feel the enthusiasm of the surrounding beasts, although they have the same enthusiasm. They feel that the city is growing at a rapid speed, and it is like flying around. It feels like flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many reports, suddenly a small report attracted the attention of the adults of Bolugan, let him always feel the thoughts and ideas of flying. This is a report of several weeds near the swamp field that are spreading towards the highlands. The person responsible for the farmland said that the grass had never been found in the swamp, and the fertility was amazing and the vitality was extremely tenacious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mom. Sure enough, it happened. The Bolugan adults licked their own painful temples. In fact, when the seeds of these improved crops were taken, the elders of the elves said that this may have happened. These magical seeds were originally the elf transformation, and they also know the natural way, and naturally know the possible consequences. Elder elders have said that these magically transformed crops are actually a brand new plant. And the negative impact of this kind of thing may far exceed the concept of 'crop crop'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negative impact? What is the most serious situation? Polupan asked this question. His curiosity has always been heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most serious? If I say that the entire continent is a disaster, do you believe it or not? The elf elder asked this question, although he was smiling. But <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crooks on the face criss-crossed like crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not very likely." Bolugan looked at the bag of seeds in his hand, even though his imagination and association were already rich. However, it is still difficult to link the bag of things with the vocabulary of destroying the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the requirements of Sedros, we use the natural magic of the leaves of the world tree to maximize the vitality of these crops and <br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reproductive power, this is naturally a good thing for you to get food, but do you know the hybrid between plants?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Know." Bolugan nodded. The books he has read are almost everything, including agriculture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the pollen of these crops is crossed with other crops, we will not know what kind of offspring will be born, but it will inherit those stubborn <br /> Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a more serious possibility, because the transition of plants is complicated, the nutrients in the land are quickly consumed, the grassland becomes desert, and then it may lead to regional climate change, and then there may be more abnormalities. For example, if the clear marsh is soiled by these grasses, the marsh wetland disappears, and the Dono River is diverted, do you know what will happen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polu The adults immediately replied: "Several cities in the Dono River will be short of water."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Lloyd shakes his head and says: "Not a few cities, but maybe the whole Ian Fass will be dry. Without the moisture of the marshes, the cold current from the northwest will not produce enough rainfall, and even the cold current will be diverted. At that time, the rainfall of the Einfas may drop to even Half of the current is not there. The other chain anti-Qing, which is produced by this, may be more and more serious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So serious? This is just Bag seeds are gone." Bolugan Mouth open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder elders still smile: "Nature is actually a very delicate and huge system. It has its own cycle and has its own way of life and death. The bag seed itself is not a natural thing. Embed this unnatural thing into this system, the impact of the birth of the sky is not only the surrounding things, but will spread farther and farther..." I put my face closer, because Bolugan’s grown-up man’s mouth was wide open, and he listened to the look of the Bible. "Adult, can you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Lloyd nodded: "Of course, there is only this possibility. After all, the power and laws of nature are anyone." It can't be completely <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master, we are only a part of nature. Maybe something will happen, maybe it happens, but naturally it will be yourself<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjustment, but this high-speed process is likely to be a disaster for people and elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "So, if I get a pot now to cook this small bag of seeds and eat it, isn't the Lord equal to saving the mainland? Like the legendary<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The heroes are the same..." The Bolugan adults looked at the bag of seeds in their hands and imagined that they had a big mouth, and it might become the savior of the mainland<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? You want to try? There is indeed this possibility." The elder elder looked at him and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brugan himself immediately and resolutely shook his head: "I don't want to. Can you save the mainland? I don't know, at least I know now<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bag of seeds is used by Oufu for help." I thought about it and asked. "Is there some short-sightedness and what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are not making short-sighted and how to make this thing? But there is no way, the elves will continue." It can only be so." Elf<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders smiled and had more wrinkles on their faces. It looks even older. "Who is not very short-sighted? Seeing that there is a lot of power and a big look, but <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who really has the power to jump out of his own eyes, stand and whole The height of natural equality is alive. I have produced only a part of this natural <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some animals that survive for survival. We do these, but they are all In order to survive, or to survive <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;survive better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rely, say so I can’t figure out what to do, what to do or what to do.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking about this little report, Bolugan’s adult had to take it with him. Lost aside. It’s not the time to do this. It’s a lot of things to do.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps sounded, and the person approached the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General Gru, is there something?" Bolugan raised his head from the table and asked. It’s not just him who works late into the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
