			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magnificent and prime ministerial palace is still there, slightly less traces of wind and frost. This did not make its momentum slightly lower, but it was more desolation and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still is still the residence of the Duke of Mulak, but the Duke of Mulak is not the one who was previously impressed but looks good and can slap you at any time. It is famous for negotiating good and elegant, and is known as the daughter of the youngest and most promising country in the mainland. Asa stood across the street and looked at the long-lost building across the street, and I was completely fascinated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his life of intentionally or unintentionally pursuing a steady freedom, almost all the grandeur of this life comes from this huge and magnificent bureaucracy, including Almost all the darkness in his life. His love, the world, the struggle, the abandonment, the attachment, the pain, the sorrow... All of them are related to this place. The people and things that have been here are all intertwined with the magic of the illusionist in their minds, and the original is deep in the mind. The deep things are constantly being pulled up, and a variety of bubbles are emerging. He remembers every time he enters and exits here, and his mood is completely different every time, but almost every time is enough for him to remember his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing? What are you going to do? Go ahead. Mulke Prime Minister is indeed here. After the emperor’s parade, she is dealing with business. Here." Talis behind pushes Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order not to attract attention, the Knights of the Temple had to listen to Asa’s advice and put away a knight’s costume. She bundled her blond hair into a male warrior's dress, and she was quite feminine and charming. She seemed to be very handsome and handsome, and her height was quite high for men. . Even Asa suddenly saw that she was a woman. Now their pedestrians are at least ordinary travellers of two men and two women. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the discovery of the Red Bishop to intimidate the Queen, and to turn the stupid stone of the Temple Knight into a helper, the rest of the time can not be applied. First of all, Luya and the Elves must be given priority. Otherwise, once the Cardinal and the Queen join forces to make the Kings ups and downs, there may never be a chance. Therefore, Asa quickly led Luya to come here, ready to take her to see the prime minister to discuss the elves' migration to Airy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here, facing the Duke’s House. Asa found that she did not seem to know what mood to use, and what attitude to go in and face that person. He frowned and sighed and wrapped Talis in for the knife two days before his hand and wrapped it up and handed it to Luya. "I won't go in. Go on your own."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Luya took the parcel and looked at him with surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a good opportunity to train you. You just need to bring my knife to the prime minister to see the prime minister, she will naturally let you see her. As for the things of Airy and the whispering of the slang, you should know what to say to her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I, I really don't know what to do... ..." Luya hesitated. When she was dealing with people, it was not long enough. Now it is necessary to negotiate with a country's prime minister to complete a major task. This seems to be difficult for some strong people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa easily patted her on the shoulder. Say: "Don't worry, your elf's request is not too much, she will promise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the comfort and urging of Asa, Luya It was only difficult to bring things to the front of the prime minister's house. After the guards were handed over to Asa’s knife and brought in by the guards, she was led by the person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You guys are really weird. It seems like you used to say that you want to take her in." Why didn't you go here?" Talis strange Looking at Asa. "I see you just groaning across the street. Are you worried that there is a master in the prime minister's office to see your true face?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa laughs without answering, but instead The black elf next to him sneered and said, "Do you think that he just looked at the opposite look is worried about the master? Why is the judgment of the Knights of the Temple so good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Talis took a look at her, but then immediately asked: "What is he worried about? It seems to be less like..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't Seeing that his eyes were as gentle as the little virgins who looked at the first love lover's residence, the poor virgins who were bound by the iron underwear of moral beliefs may not be able to feel this feeling... He used to be here in King Einfast. I have been waiting for a while, the prime minister was a young girl in the same year. He actually let the elf take his own weapons into it, is it a token? Can you guess what is going on? He doesn't know how to face the one that is different from the past. . & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp lovers only "<br <br /> & nbsp />;"The murderer must be the iron-killing killing machine. If you don't agree with the teachings of your god of light, you will not have feelings... The Knights of the Temple seem to have the same mind. The people in your eyes are not human. It’s the symbol that the textbook defines for you. Hey, I still remember Christine...” The expression of the black elf also fell into a shackle, shaking his head and not talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talizi seems to want to retort, but seems to think of something, and thoughtfully did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not speak, he was looking at Jessica with a very surprised look. He naturally did not tell her about her in the kingdom. The key is that he would never think of this black elf who seems to have more physical relationships than the spiritual connection. It can be inferred from one's own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black elf has a white eye. Say: "What's wrong? Why are you looking at me with this strange look? Is it just a sensual symbol in your eyes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course No..." Asa hurriedly shook his head. "Just... I wonder why you said this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you will be a little bit better." Jessica looked into the distance The Duke’s House responded faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked at Jessica for the first time and looked at her again and again. Her now loose nomadic dress completely covered the tempting body that was originally full of wildness, and even a small part of her face was revealed. I don’t know why, Asa felt that her background at this time seemed to be more attractive than when she was naked. Much more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prime Minister's Office. Under the leadership of the guards, Luya finally came to the study room of the prime minister. I saw the prime minister of Ian Fast, famous for being young and capable in the Duke of Mulak, Mullah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have heard about the young and capable of the prime minister, Luya did not think that she would be such a young and beautiful woman, but The majesty and temperament of being a prime minister is not because of her beauty and less. Even myself who has always had a crush on humans has to feel the credit after seeing her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of the prime minister now seems to suppress some impatience and other unrecognizable emotions. After seeing Luya coming in, she retired the guards and the clerk next to him and ordered the guards to leave the people around, without ordering to be near. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After only two of them were in the huge study room, the prime minister took a deep breath and looked at Luya with a calming voice: "Is he asking you to come to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He?" Luya thought for a moment and walked to the chair in front of the desk. nod. "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is he now? In Oufu?" The prime minister seems to be asking casually. She sat at the table, her eyes and fingertips hovering over the knife on the desk. The blade is dark and rough, her fingers and eyes are delicate and soft, and the contrast is sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, he is outside." Luya replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just outside? Why didn't he come in?" The expression of the prime minister's expression completely restored her girl's surprise at this moment. Wrong, but it was only this moment. In the next moment, she re-buried these feelings into the depths of her expression. She just sighed and said: "How is he still, sorry? I must let you come to me." It’s all because it’s a business official? What’s the matter, let’s say it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luya’s stunned, she did not expect it to be as Asa’s This is smooth. I thought about the account of Elder Lloyd. "It is like this... Mulke prime minister, our elves hope to re-migrate back to the whispering of the whisper, and the whispering sorrow is in your country's Airy, so we want to... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The negotiation took place smoothly. The original need for Elder Lloyd’s elders was just a decree of local humans who did not get involved in the whispering of the whispers. Delos's disciple, this time there are more special people to introduce, these powers are naturally not to mention, a large stroke of a command to immediately go to Airy. As for Ernest’s official announcement of the sovereignty of the whispering elf, there is no doubt that it will be slowly negotiated by Elder Lloyd and Luya in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for the help of the prime minister, the elves will always remember your friendship. I will always remember you." Luya stood up and nodded thanks to the prime minister in front of him. Not only because of this simple help, the young prime minister's calm and red-faced feelings are very kind, and she feels that she has learned a lot from her for a short period of time and has benefited a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I have nothing to do with him... How can I relate to such awkward person?" Luya's face showed an unmistakable disgust. "His mistress is an evil slutty black elf. If it is not for this task, I am not willing to walk with him anyway..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh? What's going on?" The prime minister said something wrong. "Can you tell me what is going on? More... How did you know each other? How did he have a black elf... Why don't I know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case, the first time I met him was more than a year ago, when he broke into the slang of our elves, the whisper of the sacred world, stealing the leaves of our sacred world tree... ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime minister’s expression trembled a bit, then listened attentively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the Prime Minister’s Office, in the alley across the street, Asa, who had waited impatiently, suddenly woke up: “Oops. I forgot to ask her not to Nonsense, just come out after the completion of the business. It will not be out for a long time, it must be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You even think about this now? Let An all-innocent idiot helps you to see an old lover who hasn't seen for a long time. Isn't this a natural consequence?" The black elf shrugged in the shadow of the alley. "Reassure, that little white rabbit will not be nonsense, she should only reflect the actual situation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唉..." Asa shakes his head He only felt that his head was at least several times larger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What the hell are you talking about?" The Knights of the Temple, who stood close to the outermost street with the black elves, turned back and asked. She is actually the most impatient person. During this time, there was already no rain on the woman who gave him a burning gaze. Even a duchess stopped the carriage for her and sent someone to ask her to get on the bus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf girl has been away for a while, and Xiao Xiao is still immersed in the conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the boring and heavy instruments and official duties, there has been no such emotional fluctuations for a long time, there are memories, recollections, emotions, accidents and laughter. The elf girl impressed her deeply, and she was surprisingly simple. It seems as if I have already wanted to find someone to talk about these things, and to explain everything she knows in detail. It wasn't until I said everything, I suddenly seemed to think: "The prime minister, the guy said that you are old, are you friends? What kind of friends?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ordinary friends." The prime minister smiled, and the thin eyes were exposed in a sly look. "Right. Little girl. I want to remind you that you should not talk so directly in the future. May think more about what you are talking about, who is listening to it, what will happen to others after listening to these words? You said The person may not like you to say this to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luya looked at her in confusion, revealing a seemingly incomprehensible expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, as for this thing..." The prime minister picked up the knife on the table and smiled. "This thing is here for me. You tell him that if he wants to come to me, he will take it." Her eyebrows picked and raised, and some girls were proud and naughty. "Remember. It is for himself, pro, self, come and take."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will not come. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime minister is playing alone in the study room and holding this long-lost weapon, it seems that the memory of the whole life is slowly in the mind with the touch of the knife. Appeared. The expression on her face was sometimes smiling, sometimes lost...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop Jia Wei arrived. "A voice suddenly pulled Xiaoxiao back into reality, and she hurriedly put the knife into the drawer of the desk.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hello Prime Minister. "The cardinal figure walked with his sunny smile and voice. In fact, he often came here these days. Half talked about magic, and half talked to her.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small does not exclude him. To be honest. Such a perfect man is really hard to be rejected by anyone. To be honest. Such a perfect man does It's hard to be rejected by anyone, especially in a heavy and boring official business. Some people can talk about each other, and it has to be said that it is a very easy thing. And even from a political standpoint, Xiao Yan hopes that he will have more. Some of this kind of leisure, rather than really focusing on how to put the magic school into the hands.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Jia Wei is still such a heroic and upright warrior, and young people like him do not seem to have a big robe and big-sleeved bishop costume. He doesn't seem to be accustomed to taking any entourage, just wherever he is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal just sat down at the table and seemed to find that Xiaoyan’s face was not normal. Frown asked: “What’s wrong? Prime Minister’s mood today. Isn't it good? Or don't you welcome me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, nothing..." Xiaoxiao smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly his face changed slightly. He looked around with a strange color, and then: "Is the queen kneeling down here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, why are you asking?" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Jiawei did not answer, frowned and closed his eyes. It seemed that after a brief meditation or feeling, he suddenly blinked, his eyes fell on the desk, and the drawer was placed in the drawer position, as if he could see the contents through the thick layer of wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong, Bishop?" Xiaoxun tried to restrain his own expression and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Jia Wei smiled, and this smile completely restored his brilliant glory before: "The prime minister, can take out the things you put in the drawer. Have a look?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime minister was silent, and finally opened the drawer and took out the knife. She understands that the dark fluctuations on this weapon may not be felt by others, but they do not blame the clergy of the white magic. She handed the knife to Bishop Jia Wei and said faintly: "This is something that a friend of mine has placed here. In fact, there is nothing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Bishop Jia Wei It didn't seem to listen to her. When he saw the knife, he had a strange expression on his face. He was shocked by the time, then he was puzzled, thinking, feeling, all kinds of strange expressions constantly on his face. The ground is superimposed, and in the end it is a big laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small sly looked at the Cardinal in amazement, she really didn’t understand what it’s worth laughing about the weapon that exudes a touch of darkness, let her Surprisingly, she actually saw something from the red bishop that she had never had before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal is still laughing, his eyes falling on his hand seems to be the most incredible and ridiculous thing to see the world. This majestic, prestigious young bishop has laughed before, of course, he has talked with laughter and whispers, but compared with the current laughter, Xiao Yan has a strange feeling. All the previous ones are not. His own real expression, what he showed is not the real thing in his own heart. Only now, this maddening smile, which has no solemnity and solemnity, and completely disagrees with his status and status, seems to be the real thing in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While feeling a strange fear, there is also a strange feeling of deja vu from the heart of Otaru. This seems to have seen the situation, or people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The prime minister, do you believe in fate?" Jia Wei's laughter suddenly stopped and flew to Xiaoyan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the corner of the mouth is still full of smiles, but you can see the light in the eyes of the Cardinal is unprecedented, just not aimed at yourself, it seems There is no hostility, so Xiao Yan only feels a kind of incomprehension and subtle fear, no fear of shrinking. She tried to answer: "Javier, are you shaking your faith in the Lord? Do you believe in fate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. The Lord just gives us the choice. And the courage to move forward is not to tell us whether there is any fate. Even if there is no fate, we have the courage to face it.” The voice of Bishop Jia Wei is much higher, showing a near-arrogant excitement. "I didn't believe it, but today, I believe it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought that what happened was gone. Never again. I will be back, but today, I find that this seems to be back to the original point. I thank the Lord for giving me this opportunity, I will face the same opponent again, almost the same situation, I will also fight for what I once lost. Something.” The cardinal’s words are like talking to himself. In the end, he smiled at the incomprehensible little sister and said slowly, “You are relieved, this time, I will never Lose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
