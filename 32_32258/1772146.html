Cedrus looked at the window and sighed with wrinkles on his face as if it were three months ago. A lot more time. The shortness of the silver in the setting sun seems to be a bit bleak. "Those are the elites in the army... Clorin is also the patriarch of the family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most central of the highest level of the city hall of Oufu Hongwei One is also the most central room of this city hall. The wide room was neat and clean except for a few large bookshelves filled with books and files. There was no decoration and extra stuff. Sedros' desk was right next to the window. Seen from the window below is the central square. There was a group of orcs standing on the square where the tiredness of the face showed that they were so struggling to stand up like this. It was the troops that had just returned from the Sandefes Mountains. For even more than ten days in the wilderness, there is almost no supply of emergency troops, even the beasts can not afford. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry. It’s my mistake." Asa sighed. In fact, if you honestly follow the detailed plan developed by Gru's map of Cedros, they should not lose anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros also sighed. I looked up and took the original mine and nodded and said, "But the harvest is twenty times what I expected... The purity and quality of the gemstones in these ore mines are definitely the best choice. And the quantity is really letting I was surprised that Oufu, a city that was completely out of touch with magic, could also compete with Deli Valley or Celeste in this respect." He smiled bitterly. "Unfortunately, these are the long-term values ​​that have to go through time to find out. At least, where is the current Oufu to find enough magicians to use these? And the two Bimen..." He sighed again with wrinkles on his face. It’s even more bitter to laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa asked: "Is that the two small Billion have an accident?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cedros shook his head and smiled. "It's all right. Instead, one of the werewolves who brought them back was bitten. The monster of Bimeng can eat meat at birth and has very good digestion ability, so it is easy to raise. I have sent several of the most experienced. The Orc Trainer trains them in a secret place. I will also personally plan the domestication program. As long as the ordinary army can't deal with this kind of monster, it will definitely become the unrivalled combat power of the European. Just..." De Loss's face, hope and helplessness, and so on, left and right, and strangely intertwined into a weird smile. It seems that a poor ghost who is in desperate need of money to save his life has picked up a priceless antique but cannot immediately convert it into money. "This combat force has to wait at least five years later. It is only five years before Bi Meng is barely enough to have enough size and combat strength. The meat they consume in the past five years can be piled up into a hill. Now we are even the most basic. The food supply will immediately have problems. There are so many meats to give them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The results may be huge, but it is the key to not being able to harvest. Ah," Sedros sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it something that happened during this time?" Asa is now a spirited and more vigorous old man who seems to be more engaged and hardworking than any young person today. The sigh is really too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sedros nodded helplessly and said: "Principal Magnus expressed his dissatisfaction with Oufu after a mass three months ago. He said that the barbaric beast actually set up the country and wants to stand on the same height as the people of God. This is simply a blasphemy against God. The beast is the beast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Just this? It should not be a big problem. The church can't force any country to attack Oufu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is Of course, but a caravan of Elazia came here to trade two months ago. When the three werewolves accompanied and escorted them, but they entered Elassia, the three werewolves suddenly took the caravan. Almost all killed a good light. The two escaped businessmen said that it was because some people in the caravan and they had a more serious joke to stimulate them. But according to the patrol orcs who first appeared on the scene of the tragedy, the three werewolves said Not only tearing everyone and the horse but also a Kodo beast . Even himself almost pulled himself into the meat "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Asa thought sighed. "A joke can have such a high mentality effect. The joke is definitely not simple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When this matter has not yet spread The half-orc officials of the kings of Elazia also had a dispute with a highly respected pastor on the issue of religion. After killing the priest, the statue of the church was still covered with urine. These two things have been combined. Elasia fell out of the sky. In addition, an ogre and several half-orcs sneaked into a village on the border of Tetaglia to rape and kill several women. The alarmed villagers and soldiers rushed to kill These orcs are a masterpiece of an ogre in a small town on the border of the Einfast border. The skin of the child was stripped by the ogre and carried with his head. The evidence hanging together on the neck is so solid that I don’t think it’s necessary to send someone to justify it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elascia has temporarily stopped trading with Oufu. It seems that the other places like the Einfast Empire are only a matter of time. Although the situation does not seem to deteriorate until the war is to be provoked, I think it is only sooner or later. Things.” Cedrus looked murmured to the west. "After all, the Pope’s words will not be said to be exported without any reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean..." Asa frowned. "But I think the Pope It should not be possible to be manipulated by the Necromancers.."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top leader of the 6th Patriarchal Church of the Pope’s Spiritual Leaders is definitely the Big 6 The top magician. Regardless of his own cultivation, there are dozens of templars and countless priests and cardinals in countless priests in Celeste. The Necromancer Association is of course unable to use this method to be considered as the most powerful person in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said. The most terrible place in Descartes is not their combat power but the secret influence. If it’s just a dozen Necromancers, I think There is nothing to deal with. But what's more important is that there are more than a dozen people who are more intelligent in their status. They don't need to control it, they only need to influence. What's more..." Cedros indulged in a moment and turned to Asa. wry smile. "Not to mention that the church itself will not allow Oufu to exist. So I said that this is only a matter of time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nodded. For those who do not believe in religion, the church can influence the influence of even the lost lambs after the pagan organization has eliminated the pagans. But the orcs are nowhere to look at the ‘Lamb’. They are more likely than any pagan. The pagans cannot imagine that they will convert to a bosom that does not recognize themselves. In the past, these sub-human beings just lived together in the wilderness as the beasts did not matter. But now it has become a not only pagan and it is natural that the hetero-ethnic countries are the eyes of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as for the position of His Majesty the Pope and later it is obvious that the hands and feet of the Necromancer Association echo each other. Who is using who is the guest? It is the Lord, and no one knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is to say, Oufu is actually facing the church and the Necromancer." Asa sighed. "It’s not an exaggeration to say that it is an enemy of the whole big 6."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Cedrus nodded helplessly to pry the upper body out of the window at the highest The top of the building overlooks the sunset against the sunset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where Oufu’s central room is high enough to capture the majority of Oufu’s. On the street outside the square, humans and orcs of all races mixed together and talked and sipped. Holding the horse yak and Kodo beast came to the goods. Artisan shopkeepers dwarf craftsmen and some orc apprentices waved iron. The half-orc called the goods to humans in front of the stall. Many of the original rough and simple buildings were either expanded or simply rebuilt to rebuild higher and more beautiful houses. The ogre craftsmen moved the stones and logs under the command of the architect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this looks like it’s so full of energy but it’s fragile. The turmoil in the brewing is enough to turn this place into a barren land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden brilliance illuminates Cedrus’s whiskers and every wrinkle clearly. Anyone can see it clearly. This is more than sixty years old. Old man. But it is such an old man who may not be able to use it for a long time to reach the end of his life. In the wilderness, such an unprecedented city is now trying to defend it. Although the difficulties faced are almost unimaginable, the old man's wrinkles are more white and whiter, but his waist still has confidence and vitality in his straight face and eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I rarely admire people very rarely." Asa looked at Sedros suddenly. "But I am very admired by you now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Admire me." Cedros turned his head and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In many legendary stories, someone has reached the extreme and can be invincible in the world. But I think you are more powerful than this kind of person. You are not invincible in the world. The world is a much stronger enemy than you. But it seems that you don't mean to be afraid to surrender. So I admire you a little. The enemy in the world is more admirable than the invincible world."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha...." Cedros looked at Asa with a burst of laughter. "There are enemies in the world... But it should be that you are better than me. The people who want your head in this world are at least one hundred times more than those who want me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
