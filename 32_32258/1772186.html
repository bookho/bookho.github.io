			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken steel arrow is more than one meter longer than the thumb. It can be regarded as a small spear and the engraving of the air resistance and the armor. The three magical arrays are far more advanced than the normal magical weapons and are more suitable for long-range attacks. The key is that the power skills and vindictiveness of this shot may be the strongest of the Big 6. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru took the arrow back and refuted the surprise on Willske’s face. He did not hide behind him and there were several templars. He understood that even if they couldn’t hide, they could not hide. So he bends his bow and puts his arrow on Gru to throw his arrow back and his second arrow is also off the string. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden light once again shines on the Knights of the Temple and the Golden Giant Bow and then passes to the arrow that is shot. Although this arrow was not as arrogant as the first arrow, it was still a mighty arrow. It was filled with the roar of the air immediately. Like the thunder, the whole air is roaring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the only broken magic arrow that Gru has thrown out. It’s just like a quick and undone tangible white light flashing out of the ground under the white light. The ground began to split the mud and splashed with the trajectory of white light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White light quietly meets the magnificent Jin Mang, and the majestic voice and Jin Mang immediately disappeared and disappeared like a majestic The god of the hand holding the golden weapon was suddenly cut off by a knife. The white light seems to continue to shoot at the Knights of the Temple even if there is no obstacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sound at all or because it is too late to make a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wellskai, who barely shot an arrow, has no room to escape. Although he is still wearing a glorious armor, such an arrow does not mean that even the armor of the armor is impossible to stop. In the midst of this millennium, a shadow is in front of him. It is a templar Javier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When seeing Gru’s arrow, he looks at Willske’s vision and his temperamental posture, Jarvis is from behind the church. The samurai hand grabbed a shield and flew up. He seems to know that Wellskey will not hide and can't stop the arrow. While rushing, he shouted at Talis, behind the side of Wellske: "Holy Guardian."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilskai just shot Fragmentation. Jia Wei has already rushed to him. Against the silent lasing, white light erected the shield in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shield used by the Templar is naturally quite advanced enough to defend against the vast majority of attacks. It is a pity that this arrow in front of him will not be included in most of them. In front of the white light, the steel shield is broken into pieces like a piece of paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Jay and the Wellskai behind the shield were not shredded by this arrow. The white light actually shredded the steel shield and also turned slightly and turned to Javi’s arm and flew to Talis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis did not fully understand when she reminded her in front of Jia Weifei. But it also moved a jewel on the sacred guard arm armor of the Glorious Battle Armor. A shield made of pure magic appeared on her arm. At this time, the arrow that changed direction also shot at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred guardian shield requires a powerful piece of high-level magical sapphire to produce the powerful magical power that can be formed under the transformation of the Glorious Battlegear. The sacred guardian shield can only last for a few minutes, and the price of such a whole piece of sapphire is usually enough to equip a team of thousands of people. Except for the Knights of the Temple of Celest, probably no one can use such a luxury. Equipped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the extravagant luxury is the magic shield that relies on the will of the Shrine Knight. The defense is even stronger than the legendary treasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of resistance has been clear that the guardian shield on Talis has been concentrated to the minimum and thickest and strongest. The thick, invisible light curtain of a circle and a square saw the white light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge, unmatched sound came together and came out. It was the sound of Gru's arrow breaking through the air and smashing the arrow of Wellskey to tear the Javey's steel shield and then hitting the sound of Talis's sacred guardian shield. It’s all too fast and too violent. At least in terms of sound, they can't be separated from each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two white lights collided with each other and the huge sound of Talis’s body flew out like a stone thrown by a trebuchet Hit a big tree ten meters away. On the trunk of the sawdust, a small hollow Tarith was knocked out and fell to the ground. The face was white and snowy, and the red blood on his face looked particularly striking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand of Javey’s shield is also bloody. Instead of holding the shield directly, he erected the shield and almost flattened the direction of the shield and the arrow. It was only staggered to the outside with a very small angle. After the arrow was torn and shattered, the arrow was partially dismantled and changed its direction. It’s just that this angle can’t be bigger or even more dare to pull up or down. So only the reversal is probably the only Talis who can take the arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken magic arrow has fallen on the huge steel on the ground where Talis is struck, and there seems to be some slight white light. The luster of the metal has never been so profoundly aware of its lethality. Like a violent monster, it finally consumed the horrible power. Just tame this monster and let the two Knights of the Temple and a Templar do their best. The combination of the strength and skill of the three people just resisted the blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even if this is the best way to resist it, it’s just that the risk is at the extreme, as long as there is a little bit of mistake, whether it’s Jave or a few templars behind Wellske. They will be torn into pieces by this arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other templars next to the sect, including the Adelaide, were shocked by this slamming strike and the smashing of Zhao’s wire. A short time lost. I thought they knew exactly what the consequences would be if the goal of this arrow was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru who throws this arrow is also one of the breaths and movements. This is after all his full blow in his current state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This round is temporarily tied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Gru grabs the arrow and throws the arrow, the three Lancelot know that Welsh Kay faces the danger of this full force and also sees The opportunity. So Lancelot attacked Gru. Christine and Adriek rushed toward Cedros. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they have not been able to succeed. Sedros completely blocked them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A caster wants to block three top fighters at such a distance that is almost equal to melee. A person with a little bit of common sense will think that this mage is not crazy or deliberately looking for death. But instead of being mad and not dead, Cedros did stop the three and even knocked down the two Knights of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dozens of auxiliary magical his reactions and movements, although not comparable to the three Knights of the Temple, but also far more than the average person. He first blocked the Lancelot three and let Gru freely help him pick up an arrow from Wellskey. The tacit understanding between him and Gru and the recognition and grasp of the battlefield are only a moment when he understands how Gru will do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strategy of the Knights of the Temple is very correct. The archer was originally the ruler's nemesis and Cedros was definitely a strong opponent against the weak so that Wellske's first goal was him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the opposite archers are also strong and weak. And under the enemy. The only chance for Sedros and Gru to win is to kill a long-range, lethal opponent. So Gru immediately made a full blow and became a Cedrus, who had to face the two Knights of the Temple alone and blocked Lancelot for Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the three magics of the previous three series are just to surprise the Knights of the Temple, this is almost the same as the mixed magic that immediately made them understand and completely in their common sense. Different art of casting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedrus’s raging fire wall with his hands crossed in front of the three. The white flame rises more than three meters and is more than two meters wide. Even the Hilton three in the distance can feel the heat wave. Even a cow running through the fire wall is enough to burn a layer of skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This instant fire wall technique is very standard and powerful. Even the flame master of the Tooth Tower uses this spell. But the three Knights of the Temple did not hesitate as if the swaying flames were just illusions, and they still flew toward each other's original targets and did not intend to bypass or jump over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fighter is fleeting. No hesitation in the slightest. And this fire spell even if you roast a cow, but before the anti-magic power of the Glorious Battle Armor, it is not a key. The distance of more than two meters is not the right thing for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But just as they rushed into the wall of fire, they were not solid under the wall. The foot is not on the slightest. The following is all quicksand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
