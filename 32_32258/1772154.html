			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many luxury homes in the suburbs of the city of Elazia. These are mostly the residences built by merchants or adventurers after the gold basin washing hands. These rich but unemployed tyrants like to set their home here as if they are as close as possible to Wangcheng in terms of distance and how much they can infect the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axis’s mansion is one of them. It is well known that Mr. Ai Sisi is still a violent but a hard-working fellow in the violent family. He had a thriving industry and family in Ian Fast. He knew that an accident not only made him lose all his family but also changed him into a Ugly disability. Under the sorrow, he left the home with all his property and came to settle here. He relied on the relationship with the old friends of Ian Fast. He started to sell and sell treasures. He often sells a large number of people who are said to be from his friends. Treasures. And it seems that there are also many adventurers who are selling rare items to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And during this time his business must undoubtedly be very good often seen a lot of strangers in and out of his house. From the appearance of dress, it is probably some adventurers. As always, the host does not entertain guests with great fanfare. These people usually don't like the excitement and attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basement of the mansion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the seemingly simple but substantial but absolutely unspeakable background of the owner, this underground is not known for the vast and complex parts of the building on the far side of the ground. The homes of the Minotaurs are comparable. Dozens of differently sized rooms are criss-crossed by hundreds of passages connecting them to the hidden exits of the ground. There are also more than a dozen passages for people to escape when there is a time. Here is the biggest nest of the Shamuthi thieves group. Of course, there are more than one place in other places. This is the biggest one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest room in the basement is now crowded with shoulders. Hundreds of people gathered here under the light of the butter torch. Although the ventilated pipes were very cleverly designed, this too many people made it still very boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a chief of the Knights of the Erassia can see the scene here, it’s absolutely shocking and overjoyed. The robbers killer thief lone thief swindlers All kinds of criminals that can be imagined are as dazzling as opening an exhibition. Hundreds of Elecia's rewards of wanted criminals gathered here to whisper in the torch. Every head here is worth dozens of gold coins. Every hand has more blood on the hands than in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these violent thugs carrying their own heads did not show any incitement. Although there was no crowd in the crowded underground caves, no one was loud and noisy because Helicia did not like someone to make noise. Someone was crushed directly because he spoke loudly when he was in a bad mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also a lot of newcomers who have just joined, but these people are also not stunned. One is because the temper of the leader of Helica has long been heard. The second is that the originally crowded space is carrying out a special ceremony in the Shamuthi thieves group. The four great Hans carried two objects in the crowd and stopped in front of everyone for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accurately speaking, the four big men are not holding anything in their hands but two people who are not elephants. These two people have no hands and feet, no ears, no nose, no eyes, only two big blood holes. The only thing left is a mouth because they must talk now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the newcomer who was temporarily added to the last sneak attack in the Sierra Leone forest. On the way to capture the elf's retreat, the two ghosts couldn't help but move one of the female elves. This is the case that Hilika has been banned and the two must be punished according to the old rules. After cutting off all the things that can be cut off like this, they must also tell each member carefully about the mistakes they made and why they are punished. No one has ever been able to open the door or find a chance to commit suicide. The talents of the thieves and thieves in the torture are absolutely guaranteed to be the guarantee of Elazia. Every member of the group can hear these people's confession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old team members whispered to chat with each other. Obviously this habit has long been used. The newly joined members are quite shocked and embarrassed. This month, the strength of the Shamuthi thieves group has greatly enhanced the number and strength of newcomers to join the culmination of an explosion. The reason for the joining of these newcomers is that the reason why the two leaders have deliberately recruited is that several large thieves in Elazia have been annihilated this month. Those who have escaped have joined the Shamuthi thieves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't have to listen carefully. The shining armor of the female knight and the white magic that swayed out of the hand have already clarified that it was the Knights of the Temple sent by Celeste. The annihilation of each thief group is exactly the same. In a large-scale collective action, the shrine knight smashed the tiger into the flock and took it straight. The few thieves who were also arrogant in Elazia had almost no resistance and immediately fell into disarray and then only unilaterally pursued and fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature has also organized rebellion, but unfortunately, it has no effect on blessing himself with white magic and the martial art itself is the ultimate in the temple. The knights are not the tigers. It’s easier than entering the chicken. Only one-tenth of the people except the one who immediately surrendered and surrendered were able to escape and the rest were all killed on the spot. When the thieves talked about her, they did not have the slightest scorn and scorn of the animal in the past, and even did not even regard her as a ‘human’ in their eyes. If it is not the self-confidence of the god of light, the parable of the gods in the hell of the church is very suitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This knight is a single person coming and going like the wind is not as easy to watch as the brigade officers and soldiers. And the timing of each occurrence is very good and undoubtedly prepared. Moreover, the name of the Knights of the Knights of Celeste is just enough to make most people lose their fighting spirit. It is rumored that the Knights Templar and the Templars of Celest can gather a country if they gather together a small group of less than 100 people. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people are reporting the idea of ​​closing the last vote to temporarily join the Shamuthi thieves group. As long as the person who is recognized to join has received several gold coins, he promises more benefits. There are also many people, especially the old members of the Shamuhi thieves group, who are very confident in their ability and so many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what kind of mind, so many people have been here for quite a while, but Hilika has not seen anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another room, Hilika and Aisi are facing eight people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than a hundred people over there who didn't pay attention to it because if they needed eight people to kill the criminal elites, they would never be ten minutes. These eight talents are the masters they really need. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight old men with different shapes and shapes have a sturdy old boy who also has a whole body wrapped in a black robe and only reveals a pair of charming eyes. woman. The only thing that is the same is that their strength has the help of these people. Helicia even has the urge to compete with the Knights of the Kingdom. These eight people can be said to be the strongest people in the Erasian folk and wandering in the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I need you to pay a price for you." The words of Hilika are simple and straightforward. If the businessman is undoubtedly the favorite customer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The price is usually meaningful to the living talent. I have to know if your plan really has a chance to succeed this time." A wretched and arrogant seemingly An old man who is a dozen-year-old old mouse using a metamorphosis incarnation said. "You are not the first person to play the elf idea. But in the past few hundred years, the forest in the Sierra Leone has almost never lost a grass and a tree. Why do you think we will be able to take advantage of it?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With this." Aisisi carefully took out three scrolls as if the believer showed off his holy things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the old man's eyes squinting like a bull's eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think you know that we caught five elves some time ago. And I honestly told you that it was only the experiment we did for this action. There is very little power. The reason why it succeeds is that this scroll completely breaks the magic enchantment of the elves. And this time we are prepared to have three more reels. You should see the three reels The weight. As long as the layout is reasonable, with the help of all of you, our plan will have a great chance of success."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s finger gently scrolls in the hands of Aisisi The captain sighed incomparably and then reverted to the incomprehensible appearance of saying: "Then I want all the magic items of the elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Impossible." This time Axis' eyes were bigger than the old man. "What do we do for you all?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still have so many elves. So many magical items are too difficult for you to take, don't you dare Sold to the church?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I haven't had much interest in women since I was so old. I don't have to take this to perfuse me." The old man yawned in despair and did not give in. "I want magic items."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The things that have been removed after the transfer of the magic array are all for you. Others we have to keep ourselves." The low sound is like two iron bars rubbing each other. "I only said once. I never bargained with people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the old man who heard the word 'transfer magic array' lit up and swallowed. I looked at the face of Hilika and nodded. "Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika put his eyes on the second person and asked: "What do you want?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thirty female elves." The answer is as concise as the question. This is a 30-something lean man with a s-shaped serrated blade on his back. The huge size and the coldness of the blade are still chilling in this dark basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten." Hilika answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If a large number of elves appear on the market, the price must drop so you can't give you more." Aisi immediately added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man thought about it and nodded. "Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next five people also quickly talked about their strange but absolutely amazing prices. Until the seventh person. This is a very handsome young man. A light and unpretentious dress is only wearing a long sword at the waist. If you just look at it from the outside, it is just a very good looking young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is bound to have enough reasons to stand here. These people are all selected by Ai Sisi and Ai Sisi’s vision has always been good. So Hilika asked: "What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One thousand gold coins." The young man replied. "Pay half first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first person to demand real money. Everyone knows that the huge risks and benefits behind this action are all as difficult to measure as money as the old man. And people like them generally don't have money and at least don't have such a big interest in money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Helicia reveals a somewhat surprised look. Such a humanized expression appears on his face is very rare because he is not The young man saw the fascination with the gold coins. That kind of light, even if he doesn't see it often, he can definitely feel it from his own eyes all the time. So he asked again: "Do you like money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't like it before but I like it now because I am useful." The expression of young people is not hot or cold . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good." Helicia’s face showed a sly expression. "I like people who are so frank and love money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last person is a man who looks plain. A face that disappears immediately after being mixed in a pile of people is not too easy to distinguish. It can only be said to be between twenty and forty. It can only be seen from the high-profile figure on the outside of the clothes without the slightest fat and well-proportioned limbs and a weapon wrapped on the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want." Helican asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First look at what you can get." The voice of this person sounds ordinary but not the slightest murderous or other attention-grabbing thing. The content of the words makes everyone sway. "Then I will be half."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All eyes are on this person and quite hostile. This tone and expression is not just a contempt for Shelikka but also contempt for the other seven people here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Helicia had a burst of laughter like Caracara’s eyes like a knife cut into the bones. A curious look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will value this price. It is more valuable than the seven of them." This person faintly answered the sound without a slight fireworks and a pair of dark scorpions and Heineken The eyes of the card are facing each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you are a person who is fighting a reconnaissance detachment of the Knights of the Kingdom. But I tell you that everyone here can do the same. Even though you are the old friend of Aisi, He didn't say who you are. So you have to prove it yourself." Helicika used the thick fingers to point out the other seven people one by one. "Prove why you can be worth more than seven of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black man with a serrated blade suddenly sighed and said to Helicika "This kind of expensive person, you actually dare to hire it. I killed him so that you can get more. You just have to give me five elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." Helicika smiled as if he wanted to eat. This black man is the most famous and most savage lone thief in the past ten years. In the past, the far-off man who died in his hands has changed the three kingdom elite knights. The meat is very suitable for the touchstone in this case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black man’s hand swayed behind the huge serrated blade already in hand. Several other people are standing next to the old man and Aisisi. They simply retreat to the door. This weird weapon must be used strangely and the lethality will be affected. Only Helicha did not move in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A low-sounding scream of the air in the basement filled with serrated blades for a moment. The black man became a dancing black shadow serrated blade and turned into a bright light group. The shadows and the light groups flew in the air and slid along the strange trajectories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shadow Dance." The woman wrapped in her black robe exclaimed. This martial art, which was originally used only by the legendary night elves, would appear on a human being or a man. And the night elf woman's short sword changed into a strange jagged blade that is undoubtedly a weapon specially created to match the shadow dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black man has completely disappeared and there is only a cloud of shadowy enclave moving around the room. He did not underestimate the enemy and directly attacked him to push the shadow dance to the limit and then shot at the best opportunity. The night elves have transformed the steps from the sacrificial dance to the magical extremes, and the man’s explosive power is far more powerful than the elf woman’s ability to change the position and blur the figure. At the door, Aisisi tried to open her eyes and tried to find a trace of the figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who looks ordinary is not moving. He just stood up and took out the weapon he had been carrying. It turned out to be a plain and casual blacksmith shop. You can create a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted the knife. Each of his movements is very slow and contrasts sharply with the shadows of the flying and falling movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadow moves faster and faster. As if the entire space was filled with his faintly blurred figure, the whistling of the serrated blade began to pierce. The pace of his stature has reached the limit and the rest is a thunder blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knife light just flashed the diffuse figure and whistling in the entire space. There is no collision of gold and iron. Only the clean and sharp blade is inserted into the muscles of the muscles and then the screams of screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika’s pupils shrank violently. From the beginning of the battle, he has been standing in the place where the two men are not far away. The black man dances with a jagged blade. When he flies behind him, he also stays still and keeps his posture. The muscles have not been twitched like a mountain of meat cast. It was not until this time that he had an expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is his spectator's expressions all amazed and his eyes are fixed in the same place to see the black man's feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man in black has restored his figure from the shadow of flying and he suddenly stunned. When the knife in the opponent's hand lasing out, he passed through his sole and set him directly in place. The two-foot-long blade has completely fallen into the sole of the foot and the underlying masonry leaves only a short shank on the sole of the foot. His body was still half a circle around the anchored foot because of inertia. His miserable snoring could not cover the sound of the foot bone being twisted by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your dance is really ugly." The man shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black man roared in his hand with a serrated blade and made a whistling light to throw at the opponent. This man just flew in the direction of a saw blade. I don't know if it is a coincidence that the sawtooth blade that has changed direction has flew directly to the Greek card that is close at hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
