			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tower of the Tooth, the main room in the tower at the top of the Tower of the Earth, Luya is healing the Granddon Tower, who is sitting on a chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves of the world tree are placed on the head of Granden's master. As Luya continually mourns the spell, the green and magical fluctuations of vitality are like water. The leaves overflowed and slowly flowed into the body of the Granden Tower, gradually infiltrating into it. The two huge scars on the Lord's main body that were "stolen by the elves" have been restored at an alarming rate visible to the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid someone disturbing, there is only Adelaide Master and Asa in the room except Luya. Luya’s mantra has been going on for quite some time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you come over?" I don't know if I have to wait for some attention, and I have been frowning at Rude's treatment. Lee suddenly turned his head and looked at Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This distance is enough to appreciate your beauty and style." Asa smiled. From the tower of the tooth with Luya, when he saw the master of Aidelide, he seemed to keep the distance between her three steps and five steps, intentionally or unintentionally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn’t the point closer to see more clearly?" The female mage also smiled, the tiny crow's feet in the corner of her eyes wrinkled, and the crow's feet were on such a woman's face. It doesn't seem to be annoying, but it is a manifestation of the charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm afraid of squinting, I can't see anything else." Asa smiled and shrugged. Within five steps, he has enough confidence to hold any mage. Of course, monsters like Sander are not in this rank, and even if he is hugged, it doesn't make any sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that he is allergic, but he’s unknowingly has this kind of carelessness at all times, just like a habit. This is a habit that has been developed from countless battles, bets and conspiracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Luya took a long sigh of relief and took the leaves of the world tree from the head of Grandmaster. Only her brows were wrinkled, although the two scars on the chest had returned to the point where there was no trace, but the Lord of the Granden was still so stiff and did not change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I have tried my best." Luya wiped the tiny sweat on her forehead, and the cast for a few minutes made her look tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How could this be?" Master Adelide was surprised first, then shook his head in disappointment. "I thought it would be necessary to dispel these curses with natural magic." And toxins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luya shook his head with some embarrassment: "The toxins in his body are really weird. What is even more strange is the curses, it seems It is life. The curse and the toxins are combined with each other, and they are also combined with the vitality of Granden’s body. I forcibly cured one place, but just transferred the power to other places, and the other curses and toxins will be renewed. Sweeping over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not ineffective, but there is no way to completely get rid of it." Adelaide Master thought about it and said, "Maybe you are Luya Elder. The control power is not enough..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am really sorry." Luya looked embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter. Maybe the Granden Tower Lord has already been summoned by the god of the elements, which is not necessarily a bad thing." Adriatic Master smiled slightly. Her original face and her rich expression suddenly became abnormally calm, as if she had really been obsessed. "It's better for me to arrange for you to rest and go tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like me to try?" Asa suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you won't be the natural magic. There is no way to use the leaves of the world tree." Luya said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Try it and you will know. Otherwise you have to give this world tree to Master Adelide." Asa suddenly took it forward. The leaf of the world tree in the hands of Luya, looked at the master of Adelaide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Adelide did not speak, looked at Asa and looked very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike Luya's slow mourning mantra and gentle method of casting, this time the magical fluctuations are not slowly distributed, it is completely erupting and erupting. Luya and Aideli could almost hear the sound of the explosive explosion of magic. The magical atmosphere of a mountain torrent instantly engulfed the body of the Granden Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the green vitality that overflows from the leaves of the world tree, but also the black breath that exudes from Asa’s body, and occasionally The light of white magic flashed in between. These chaotic magical waves are intertwined, entering, traversing, and colliding on the body of the Granden Tower in a near-violent way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luya was surprised to look at Asa with a big mouth. This chaotic magical fluctuations filled with full house is no longer related to the concept of saving people, but it is more like hurting or killing. The magical fluctuations slammed into the unscrupulous madness of Master Grandon. If the unknown person came in, he would never think that the chair was a dying patient, but a prisoner who was being tortured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aidley’s eyes were all surprised, but she did not interfere with the flash, just looked at her face with surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic volatility does not have any substance, but Luya and Aideli both have the illusion of being in the waves, the magic waves in this house There was no sound in the collision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, Asa took a long sigh of relief and took off the leaves of the world tree at the top of the Grandden tower. The magical fluctuations of the full house stopped short. In addition to Asa's snoring sound, there is another very loud snoring, and the body of the fighting tower is also moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luya and Aideli both showed a surprise color on their faces, but Asa did not seem to react, he was kneeling down and looking at the grid carefully. Master Langdon’s fingers, which had no scars on the fingers, had a bit of red blood on their fingers, which was a strange smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tatura's toxins in the tail of the dragonfly, the leaves of the black mist cover of the lizard swamp specialties, the sunset flowers of the Descartes Valley, the underground iris The toxins in the lion's tail are mixed with dark magic and cursed, in addition to the carrion poison in the necromantic magic... even one of the strongest behemoths can't stand it." Asa looks at Glendon The main finger of the tower smiled a bit, and he probably guessed what was going on. "It turned out to be him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used water spells I have seen it. If I don’t have the heart, I can’t even see that there are such violent toxins lurking in the main body of the Granden Tower. According to the truth, my water system can dispel any toxins, but the toxins contain The curse not only hides the effects of the toxins, but also completely invalidates my spells. Although the Necromancer itself is sufficiently sophisticated, the curse that is integrated with the toxins is inevitably too strong."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table on the table is from Remove the Landeng Ta master finger blood that point, in the light like a mass flow around red gem. Although the Granden Tower Lord has been rescued from the toxins and curses, the body is still extremely weak, and even there is no way to say that he is taking a rest. There are still only Adelaide masters accompanying Asa and Luya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The curse is not the most powerful, the most powerful is the means of the guy who started. The Granden Tower is concealed without warning. It may just be a hand." As far as this is concerned, Asa couldn't help but pinch his hand because he was once almost once held by such a hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aidley’s master nodded and said, “Well. If it’s a frontal battle, no one is very easy to hold the Grandmaster. The acquaintance of the group heard that it was a very handsome middle-aged man..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Marquis of Hamm Elni." Asa said faintly, "I will It’s strange that the old man’s whispered singer just happened to migrate, and the Sun’s banned borders just failed. Judging from the words of the Cavaliers who liked the knife behind them, the Marquis may have gone to Celeste. Unfortunately, The old man didn’t know that he was someone else’s tool when he died.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “He’s dead, the tower of the tooth can now be completely quiet, saving me from myself. Looking for an opportunity to start. After the Grandmaster master is awake, we both sit in the town, no matter whether it is Deya Valley or Celeste, don’t want to move me.” Aideli sneered, then looked at Asa, smile on his face. I also replied to the kind of awkward gentleness. "This time, it’s all thanks to you, I don’t know. What can I thank you for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
