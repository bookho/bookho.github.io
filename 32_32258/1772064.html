			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big ear monster is the most common sub-human being and they have their tracks almost everywhere in the Big 6. Their skin, which is almost green and green, is generally more ugly. It is a pair of big ears behind the head. Strictly speaking, they should also be regarded as a kind of orc. Although intelligence is lower than humans, it is also the language of human beings. It seems that they also have their own language and it is said that there was a country of their own for a long time but they did not know why. Because they are the only races that are related to human society, they don't treat them as wild beasts like other orcs only when they are very low races. They usually live in the cracks of human society. Thiefs are good at doing things and doing all kinds of low-level work. Things like this hostage-taking were never unique. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa followed the map left by the big-eared monsters and thought that it would be hidden and guarded against the deep lair but could not think of just outside the city of Bracada. A hill in a dozen miles. The cottage that was blatantly built outside the cave was so visible that it was visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Asa newspaper’s identity and intentions, the big-eared monsters introduced him to the cottage. There are about a hundred big ear monsters inside, and I heard that Asa is redeeming the hostages and is happy to point at him in the distance. Asa noticed that it was not a well-arranged nest that seemed more like a makeshift camp. They are all built with wooden boards and thatched one east. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big ear owls did not tell the person who reported at the beginning of the kidnapping how much ransom is just for the duke to send someone. It seems that I did not expect such an unexpected and valuable harvest to go back and slowly consider how much money I can get. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the person?" Asa always cares about the book. He wants to see Chris first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few big ears discussed it and took him to a cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cave entrance was separated by a wooden fence and became a ready-made prison. There are still a lot of food left in it, and it seems that the big ears do not abuse this precious prisoner. It was just that Criss had been scared enough to look awkward. When I heard the father sent someone to redeem myself, I was so happy that I sat down beside the wooden fence and cried. It was a surprise when she looked carefully at Asa. "Is it you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the book?" Asa asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Book? What book?" Kris's answer made him feel scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the book that I lent you in the library of the School of Magic when you walked and said to be on the road."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was locked up here for so long, I was afraid of dying. When you met, I didn’t ask me how I didn’t care what books I went to ask." Chris cried. It’s up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa tried to calm down and said with the voice of the child as gently as possible: "Don’t worry, since I am here, you will definitely be fine. See you are fine. I am very happy in this spirit. But the book is really important. Where do you remember?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was robbed by these guys in the bag Got."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence made Asa almost jump. But if you think about it, maybe the big ears will not leave the goods without checking them. If they see that the book may be thrown away, maybe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you are here waiting for me to discuss with them, I will save you immediately." Asa reached in and took a picture of Chris's head. She is going. Turned around and said to the big eared monster behind him: "I want to see your collar." The big ear snorted and took him out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of a makeshift wooden house, there is a gorgeous table that is obviously stolen. It looks like the big ear of the collar is sitting at the table. It seems as if the waist is quite majestic and there are several big ear monsters standing behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa wants to open the door to ask questions but thinks that after all, he is here to redeem the person or to handle this thing first, so that he is also at the table. Sit down and ask: "How much do you want in the end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big ear screaming seems to be clearing the throat and the unique nasal sound of the big ear The strong voice said: "You humans have always looked down on us and have been oppressing us to devalue us as a barbaric race. In fact, we also have a long-standing culture. When you see that we have not abused hostages, we try to reduce the number of people." His ugly face seems to be trying to create a serious and self-contained look of a diplomat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big-eared monster seems to be offended and patted the table and said: "The attitude of you is to despise us. Do you think that we are a poor nation? I tell you that the time has come for us to turn over and will not let you humans again. I’m bullying.” The ugly face was hard on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nodded and said, "How much do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;大耳怪领I turned my head and talked with my peers. I turned around and said, "Don’t look down on us. We know that she is the daughter of a duke called Mulak. We also sent people to investigate the power of this duke. And the financial resources are very big." He first extended five fingers and then immediately reduced to one. "We want five thousand gold coins." His narrow eyes narrowly stared at Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good." Asa nodded briefly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big ear screamed and thought it would be so simple. A big eared monster behind him seemed to use his foot to top him. He immediately put another finger up. "It’s not two thousand gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. "Asa is more refreshing. He just wanted to hurry up and negotiate the price to ask the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few big ears behind the collar that are moving a bit. This time, they didn’t wait for them to signal that they stood up and excitedly said: “I’m not wrong, we have five thousand gold coins.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa frown. He can see that these guys are seeing the wind and turning the rudder. But if you just see a few silver coins in front of you, he may clearly distinguish the exact meaning of the money, but once he has a large number of his experience, he is completely dizzy. He felt that one hundred gold coins and ten thousand gold coins were sharing a simple concept of 'a lot'. When I think of the status of the Duke’s adult, I’ll nod my head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Determining that we want 10,000." Asa's refreshment provoked the ambition and fighting spirit of the lion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa took a table and stood up. He was already on fire. The collar immediately made a concession and raised his hands and said: "On this price, we will definitely not add any more." He saw Asa re-sit and went back and said. "Who wouldn't feel bad about his children? You think about any animal, whether you care for your children, if my children have an accident, I will certainly save him at all costs. The Duke will certainly be like this." Compared with the gold coin, of course, the daughter is important. He must return the price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa frowned and said: "Oh, that's the way it is. I will let you go when you bring the money tomorrow." The excitement was so excited that he said with great strength: "Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Right There is one more thing, "Asa began to talk about his true purpose and understatement. "Our lady also has a portable book that I hope you will return the book to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Book? I don't know where it is." The ear grotesque looked at them and shook their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's really worthless for you. It's just a little commemorative value. Just ask us in the bag of our lady." Asa looked carefully at the look of the big-eared monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bag? All the goods have already been disposed of." The big ear seems to be very cautious and vague, but it confirms that the Asa is the most Worried about things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the book now?" Asa hopes to hold the last line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collar suddenly sensibly angered and took a table to stand up and said: "We are not good to deceive you, you don't want to set a message from us." Sa waved. "Well, let's go, remember to bring the money tomorrow. Otherwise, wait for your lady to collect the corpse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is almost rushed out by those big ear monsters On several occasions, he almost wanted to punch a ugly face of the big-eared monster that was pushed behind, and he did not take it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the worst case that the book was indeed sent to the city of the orcs. How do you get it back? Asa’s heart was so upset that he suddenly caught fire. He has never been so overfired, and there is a place where there is fire and no venting, which can make the anger cycle and rise. If it wasn’t for Cliss who was still in their hands, he promised to turn around and kill the squirrels of the green skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
