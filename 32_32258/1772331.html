			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since they can kill Mori, if they kill again, what should we do? There are only two of us here..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They have absolutely no chance to come back." Tima High Priest spit out a sentence. "I will count this account on Celeste's head sooner or later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are holes in it? How can the Knights of the Temple know this? What do you know?” Rayleigh looked at the crack at the top of the cave, where the Knights of the Temple went. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the time being, don't worry about this, Moriel is already dead, those black ghouls must be flustered, cash now we are going to gather the remaining troops, first put They all annihilated and said." The high priest took a long breath, although this curse storm was indeed a huge blow, but how much can be achieved on a psychological balance compared to the long-cherished wish of Uninen Slightly tilt in the direction that is slightly better. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the Tima High Priest and Basil Lei arrived at the Tauren’s Base Camp Corner Demon Temple, the balance immediately collapsed. The great priests of the past dynasties have carefully repaired and maintained, and the white bones accumulated by countless white bones have now become fragments of the land. And this is not to stimulate the high priest of Tema, outside the temple, the largest cowhead colony in the labyrinth, the young Tauren and the female Tauren body in the ground just made him almost crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it’s just a female tauren and a little tauren who can’t get on the battlefield, it’s not easy for ordinary warriors to deal with, let alone thousands of women and children staying here. . Only they face the great magician Caitlin in the Knights of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the team to get out of the single to face the thousands of Tauren women and children here, can be assigned to perform this task. It also explains the profound magic of Caitlin's Master, and the combat power is excellent. What's more, she also carries more than a dozen magic scrolls of the summoning element giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the mighty warriors and priests, no one can deal with more than a dozen earth elements summoned by the wizards. Caitlin's magician is not eager to use great magic. The instant mid-level magic is like a jewel in her hand. The fire wall consisting of a fire wall, the sand-sand piles block the exit channels, and two air elements drift around to patrol the Tauren who are trying to escape. The ice-cold bursting and lightning flashing around smashed the Tauren. Although the Tauren women are escaping toward the labyrinth of their place of residence, under the eyes of the magician of the Master, the killing is not hindered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Tauren troops withdrawn from Othello arrived, they could just see the blue afterglow after the wizard used the delivery reel, the biggest The remaining Tauren women and children in the maze are already less than 100 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tauren’s fertility is originally low, and the tauren’s women and children are the future of race. And this death in Caitlin's hands in the hands of the Archmage is already the majority of the future of the Tauren tribe. In addition to the warriors in Othello and the thousands of adult warriors who have been burned into the ashes in the Purgatory Paradise, the entire Tauren can not be said to have been uprooted, and it is not much worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on the wreckage of the horned demon, I heard the number of women and children killed and reported by the men, and the great priest of Tema was as strong as a stone statue. A blood finally could not help but spray it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cyester... I will definitely count this account with you." The high priest was roaring, and the remaining Tauren warriors were equally jealous. stand up. The roar of the roar is like a thunderous thunder, and the earthquake is regretted by the horned demon temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But their anger has not yet had time to burn completely, and there is a newer battle that has caused the Tema High Priest to vomit almost another blood. The report was sent by a eagle witch under the hands of Basile. She is responsible for monitoring the situation at the Molly Dragon Cave. It is impossible for her fragile body to enter the Dragon Cave with the Tauren Warrior Knights, but she is also one of the few witches in the banshee family,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Although the magic power is not as good as the ordinary human magician, but the practice of the half-hanger magic eye with many years of flexibility and speed, reconnaissance<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mollier is not dead... The remnants of the Black Elves are gathering to kill here." The eagle screamed and gasped against Basile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? You say it again? Make it clearer!" The Tema High Priest no longer had the slightest self-control, grabbed the eagle witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How could she not die? We all heard her screaming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I also heard..." The eagle witch fluttered with wings and hands and feet. The wrinkled face has risen red. Like a chicken that is only pinched in the hands of a human brawny. "I saw it in the eyes of the magic god... After the screams, her vitality was really declining, almost dead... but then a person appeared, her vitality recovered again... Finally Duden The family's mother led the troops into the Dragon Cave. I heard them coming out and shouting to gather troops to attack here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Account. How could this be the case?” The blue ribs on the head of the Tima high priest were all picked up, and the big hand that was holding the eagle witch was also so crazy. The original thick voice has begun to move closer to Basil. "Those knights of the shrines? Marquez priests?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There seems to be dead, but the others seem to have escaped...help... Uh..." As the high priest twitched and tightened, the face of the eagle's witch became more and more red, his hands and feet swayed more and more, and finally a cock crowed like a scream, slammed and stunned. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marquez failed? How could it fail? He has those scrolls..." Tima High Priest said to himself, his huge body <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chicks in the cold wind sifted up. He seems to have forgotten that the body of the eagle witch is still in his hand, and the corpse still has Carrara's bone fracture in his hand and continues to deform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How could this be? How could this be?" The slut screamed insanely, and did not seem to care that the only witches in her family were squeezed. The meat sauce. "What should I do next? What should I do next? Moriel will never let us go. She will have to leave the hole to deal with us as soon as she recovers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"She has recovered, probably can get out of the hole at any time. Otherwise the black elf does not have such high morale, will not take the initiative to attack us." Tema high priest muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground is slightly shaking, that is the formation of the savvy knight running to bring vibration. The troops that all the black elves have assembled are not far from here. The high priest felt that they got it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do? What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All retreat, escape. Moriel no longer Will allow any Tauren and harpy to live." The voice of the high priest has returned to boring, and the original torch-like eyes are no longer bright, and now it is all blood red, that is The blood red that is desperate and angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Escape? Where to escape?" Rayleigh Ray asked. She really can't think of where the whole Nigan can go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ground." The priest of Tema was very difficult to come up with a very simple word from the mouth, and then a low-pitched voice that was either awkward or roaring. It was still huge from his throat, but it was still huge, but it did not match the head of the cow. There was a lot of blood in it. It seemed to come from a carnivorous animal head. "Cyrene, Magnus, you are waiting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mollier is actually Akibad sealed in Nigan five hundred years ago of. Akibad has sealed part of her life and soul into her own blood as the center of the seal. As long as she is far from the seal, her strength and life will continue to weaken, so Moriel has never left for so many years. Nigen. I think whether it is because of the collection of the precious treasures by the dragon itself, or the dissatisfaction with Akibad, it will certainly accept the hilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This jewel is the dragon blood that seals the vitality of Morrill. It is the seal of the master of Akibad. This should be Morrison is well preserved, why is it now in your hands? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must be someone who wants to deal with her, so it destroys the seal, but fortunately, from a gem, Moriel is still alive. You will go straight to Nigan and return the item to her again. She will be grateful to you if she fills the seal for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the words that Aier’s mother told Asa after seeing this black gem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
