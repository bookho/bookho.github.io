			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tamik Knight did not take the opportunity to attack. His voice is still cold and hot, like a piece of wood, but the whimsical fluctuations on the face of the wooden, it may be a small smile, but it is probably too long to laugh, no expression, even a person He should have forgotten how to laugh, so this smile is very weird. Although they did not trap the two together in a trap, the current situation is also what he is happy to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's because you have to let go when you let go." Asa replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had already pulled Luya, but when he found out that the trap had already started, he immediately let go, and he rushed to the ice for the moment. Come out. In any case, the two people are too late, as long as they are completely sealed in the center by such a thick magical ice wall, there is absolutely no way to get out of it with his own vindictiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He let go of more than Luya, and he had to let go even the parcel full of magic scrolls, with both hands holding the knife to break the ice that was about to be frozen. Floor. Now the small parcel is frozen next to Luya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you find it wrong? I believe that you still see this magic trap, just be alert." The Tamik Knight still has not vie Shot. He seems very willing to talk to this opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are a lot of things wrong. For example, I know that you must not be the kind of person who likes to be boring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is boring?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Bored to kill more than one hundred elves, put the body code well. Also put blood flow It’s all over the place.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Not boring.” The Tamik Knight faintly replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled a bit: "Yes, not boring. The blood that has solidified can cover up the weak fluctuations and smells of the magic trap. The body is more like this. Deterrence. Even if I can't lie to me, I can at least lie to her, and when she kills a few of her faces, she will naturally get out of control. Unfortunately, I wake up late."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamik Knight nodded slightly. There was a strange light flashing through my eyes. "In general, I hate talking to people. But now I find it very interesting to hear you. You are really good. Not only are you good at your skills, but your mind is also good. The key is to have enough judgment in such a situation. Look at these excellent places before you die, it will make me feel as much as possible." His voice like a wood spoiled. It seems to be something like emotion. "You know, I haven't had the urge to kill people for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then kill it." Asa glanced at the ground intentionally or unintentionally. . The thick blood on the ground was half-condensed, as if he had already smeared his feet on it. He did not move any more after he broke the ice from the ice. He continued to look at the Tamik Knight and asked: "Since you want to kill me like this. Why don't you start? You are still a talker, and you can't even catch an attack. I know what you did. Everything just wants me to die. Do you want me to step on two more traps? I said, I know that you are not the kind of boring person who likes nonsense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamik Knight laughed, this time he finally really laughed. But this smile appeared on his face that seemed to be insulated from the concept of laughter. It looked more awkward than a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's hard to meet someone who knows me like this. I like you." The Knights of Tamik changed their voices. This sentence is no longer His wood sounds like a sound, but when the beasts chew their prey, they are sticky and full of blood and swallowing desires. From the thickness of desire and killing in this voice, you can feel that this is the killing that has been hidden for ten years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The range of blood staining is very large. The trap should also be more than that ice trap. Just watching the Tamek Knight stand still in the same place, Asa knows that he won't want to move, and he won't want to take a chance to kill himself with the opportunity he just broke. Because of your own side, there may be several or dozens of magic traps in less than an inch next to your feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The understanding between friends is never straightforward than the understanding between the enemy. It is the easiest to see the human nature nakedly in a hostile state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not dare to jump wildly. If there is no run-up, it must jump very high in the in-situ jump. It must be very far and very hard. The flaws that are exposed must be great. The Tamek Knight will never miss such an opportunity. He knows that in such a situation, it is difficult to resist the opponent's full-powered blow. This is simply a trap designed to deal with him, perhaps the most professional and hottest killing machine set on the mainland. All of my own reactions must have been in the expectation of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tamik Knight is not in a hurry to shoot. Instead, I asked, "I have asked a few elves. The strange thing is yours? Where is it now? Is it on you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Asa smiled: "Why do you think I will answer you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamilk Knight kicked a foot, a piece of thorns flew to a pile Next to the elf. As before, a raging flame instantly swallowed the faint elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the flames, dozens of elves have only one black mane and a heavy burnt smell. But Asa’s eyes didn’t blink, and she didn’t even look at it, as if it’s just a child burning a pile of dry wood. The eye was stunned by the Tamik Knight. He nodded and said, "I also know that these should not threaten you... but this may be better." He raised his voice and said: "Bring her out. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the voice of the Knights of Tamik, three people turned from behind the tree in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the appearance of these three people, Asa stunned. To be precise, two people dragged one person out, and a Templar and Abin, who left and left, dragged Talis out. A blonde female knight is now tied up in a solid state, her mouth is covered with a bunch of leaves and weeds, and there is a deep wound on the shoulders and arms. Half of the body has been stained with blood. It is. Her pair of phoenix eyes does not seem to be just a fire, but also to bleed the bleeding, full of bloody look at the Knights of Tamik and the next Abin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hand over the thing, or tell me where to take it." The Knight of Tamik raised the long knife in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You threaten me with your own companions? Do you think it works? I just think it's funny." Asa smiled, but he didn't even look at it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. It’s not funny." The voice of the Knights of Tamik regained the woody wood, and the fangs in his hand slashed straight. Head to Talis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the strange smell in the forest suddenly disappeared and disappeared, the sacred warrior who was half-dead by the breath of the breath struggled to recover, and then carefully reluctantly Looking at the magical eyes, I found that the two men and the leaves of the world tree disappeared together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to determine whether the disappearance of the two people and the leaves of the world tree is related to that strange atmosphere, the Tamik Knight did not hesitate, but directly It was decided to sneak into the whispering forest. That opponent has been temporarily absent, and no one in this huge forest has the ability to hinder him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sneak, hold, assassinate these aspects, he is indeed an expert in the expert, the master of the master. No matter how great the prey is, he can use the most subtle and perfect method to disintegrate and cut it in the shortest time, and turn it into a dish that can be enjoyed by him. From the beginning to the whispering of the forest, to the complete control of the situation, the tens of thousands of elves are controlled in the palm of the hand, the Tamik Knight did not spend more than an hour, it is absolutely fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead wood guards were consumed more than half of the day's wars, and the elves who had been tossed by the wars had no energy to guard. The magical eyes of the Templars easily distinguish the arrangement in the whispering forest. Tamik took Talis to the four people. The magical eye can distinguish the elder elders from the ordinary elves, so it doesn't take long for all elf elders to fall into the grasp of the Knights of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves are not unguarded lambs to be slaughtered. If you really want to touch them hard, the Tamik Knights will be stronger and harder. The opponents of tens of thousands of elves. But when all the elders of the elves have fallen into the hands of the other, the elves have no way. They are kind and peaceful, and they are no different from rabbits in front of the Tamik Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves didn’t know how to resist, but the Tamik Knights began to signal the Templar to give them a demonstration of enough vibrancy. The flames rising from the sky in a magic trap turned dozens of elves into coke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
