			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of former King Brown and Prime Minister Rosker was not transported and piled up on the wall like two piles of rags. The meeting started again. Other tribal leaders other than the five major tribes were also invited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lizard patriarch came in with the Prince of Taze and sat at the conference table with other tribal leaders. The unconscious Hari leader was taken away and took over from his meeting with the cousin of his son, King Brown. When the cousin of the king was arrested and told that the throne had been replaced, he still roared: "This is a throne." But as soon as he saw the bodies of Brown and Roske, he immediately calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribes who came in later saw the two bodies and were shocked. But they are not afraid of the two bodies but think of the shadow sage behind the two bodies. However, Gru's explanation immediately turned their panic into horror and fear. The token that the shadow sage hangs on the head and neck in his hand faintly throws a sentence to everyone: "Reassured. I promise that he will never appear in front of you again." A back look out of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tai Ze also changed from a prince to a king. Because it is a very special period plus he is also the only male legal successor of the royal family now, even if there is no formal ritual style, the traditional Taitari tribe leaders did not feel anything wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why they don’t have any opinions may not be just because of these. The conviction of the two bodies in the corner of the wall is indeed very plentiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe someone will think that I am letting outsiders interfere with Taitalia’s affairs is a traitor. I know this is the most of all Tatlial people. I hate things that hate hatred. But I think everyone knows what it means to Tatulia if I have been sitting in this position. I can’t do this.” Taize is facing the tribes of the tribes. Although his looks look really ugly and even ridiculous, but the gestures are calm and easy to accept, and there is a vague taste that people can't refuse. This temperament and temperament are indeed necessary for being a leader. "And General Gru was only invited by me to help me. He will leave immediately and Oufu will not interfere with any of Tatalia in the future. So please accept my more extreme practice." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the Hari, all the leaders nodded slightly and accepted that many people had faces on their faces and smiles and the tears on the faces of the Harrys’ sons were contrasting. The status of the Hari, who has always been in the position of the King, has naturally followed the interests of those who had been monopolized by them. Even if it is indeed an extreme practice, it is immediately peaceful and friendly under such specific measures. And in fact, the King of Taize is indeed more capable than ten times his brother can do more suitable for this position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new king Taize went on to say: "Now I am convening this meeting to discuss something with you. I am going to make Tatalia and Oufu join. Alliance. Regardless of whether you want to link this decision with the help of General Gru to me, please think about the benefits that Oufu brings to our Tadalia."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A tribal leader immediately said: "It’s only during the period after the establishment of Oufu that the income of our family has doubled because of the active trade."<br /><br />&nbsp Another tribal leader also nodded and said: "The sales of ore have also improved. Because of the convenient transportation to Oufu, we can directly supply the goods to merchants in other countries. Less intermediate links. There are more gold coins earned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With Oufu as a transit, you don’t have to sneak into Elazia to smuggle and earn Ella. The gold coins of the bitch of the bitch in West Asia."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And we are . Euphorion recent exhibition of the country Euphorion damn fast faster than those weeds in my yard "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; tribes who have brought nodded. Talking about gold coins is always easy to be happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But now Elecia has also stopped trading with Oufu." The oldest old man in the middle of the collar opened his mouth and talked slowly. Unclear but obviously the mind is clear. His words speak of the scruples in everyone's heart. "Everyone knows that Oufu's situation is not good now. Although I have to admit that we have gotten a lot of benefits in Oufu, but will there be such a benefit in the future? Further, we need to offend others for it. Is it a religious country?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Taize slowly nodded to the old man and said, "You are also very good at the Trossa chief. But according to my eyes, the situation of Oufu is not bad but very bad. It can be serious even if it is serious. It is called danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone must remember that Pope Magnus once expressed dissatisfaction with Oufu. Now it is said that some people deliberately planted it. The relationship between Oufu and the surrounding religious countries has been very tense. Even though Mr. Sedros has no intention of war and tries his best to mediate mediation, the war may be only a matter of time.” King Taize looked at the tribal leaders’ voices more and more. heavy. "The latest news came that the Pope of Seyster had called several cardinals a few days ago. Although the contents of the meeting did not know, but heard a cardinal said after the incident that the Pope is now on the big 6 The beasts of the gods and the pagan countries were very dissatisfied. Then dozens of Templars and several Templars who were stationed in the Glorious Castle almost scattered into the various faithful countries."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a commotion in the collar. The smell of smoke and blood in this news seems to echo in the hall. Some tribes said to Taize: "You know that this is the case now, why should you form an alliance with them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The pope’s words may just be targeted Oufu only. Although we and Erasia have always had some minor conflicts, have they not really attacked us a lot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of Taize sighs A heavy tone of expression, even after the ugly and funny five senses, can make the leaders feel clear and clear. "Even if he is only targeting Oufu. I don't think you are a fool who has no doubts. I think if Oufu is really trapped under the siege of the surrounding religious countries, then what is it?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What will happen next?" The leaders whispered. Only the elders of the Trosars thought about an old face and shook a few times. "Do you mean that they will deal with us next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of Taize nodded. "Yes. The existence value of the central city of Oufu, a wild land, has been confirmed. And Cedrus led the orcs to establish Oufu so well. And the buildings there are almost all built by rocks. No matter what kind of battle. It is also impossible to completely destroy Oufu as a ruin. Therefore, after they win, they will definitely take Oufu as their own. And when the wild highland becomes the sphere of influence of the church, how will they deal with the only territory on the high ground and still leave? What about Oufu’s recent Tatalia?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “We are not afraid of those church pigs who are coming to let them come.” A barbarian tribe’s collar Immediately roared. "I want to strip the white robe pigs and live them on the stakes as I did last time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just this is enough to be war with us." The reason." King Taize looked at this courageous collar and shook his head and sighed. The Tatulia folk style is simple and brave. "I never doubt the courage and strength of our soldiers in Tatalia. But I have been confronted with Erasia for so many years. I don't have to explain in detail. Everyone knows the difference in strength between the two countries. It is only because of the swamps. The terrain makes the army of Elazia extremely unsuitable and the land and resources of Tetalia are not rare for them. It is not worthy of letting them fight with many of our warriors who can sacrifice themselves to defend their homeland. So we can still Sitting here. And if they need to eradicate us and then join other faithful countries to attack from the heights of the highlands... that may be the time for our country to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of His Majesty the King just screamed out of the mouth of the collars: "Let those church pigs do his daydreams. I want to dare to step into Tataglia." Church pigs taste my axe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The warriors in the swamp land cannot be destroyed. We will use the last drop of blood to protect our home. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to prick the crucifixes into their assholes and then force them to clean." The tribal leaders are screaming and screaming at the conference table. I can imagine the most vicious words cursing Erasia and all the believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of Taize did not care about these brave warriors, but quietly looked at the four major tribes who were not so excited. People who can sit in this position are obviously more so-headed than others. King Taize once again said to them with a heavy tone: "So I said that we have no choice but to form an alliance with Oufu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But even if the alliance is How about? Is it possible for us and Oufu to resist Erasia and so many religious countries?” Trossa leaned slowly and said the old-fashioned tone and thoughts. "Think about other options."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible." The roar in the hall was ten times louder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Absolutely impossible. Want us to surrender to the church pigs who are stupid than the lizards and more disgusting than the dragon flies?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I prayed with the pigs to pray in front of the wood? No, I swear in the name of my ancestors that this kind of thing will never be born in the country of the swamp." Those tribal collars that were easily excited They were stimulated by this method to jump. For a time, the hall was full of angry screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lizard patriarch who has never spoken suddenly said: "If Tatalia is to return to the church, then I will lead my people out of Tatalia." Join Oufu." His voice and expression are still the indifference of the lizard's unique lack of temperature and change, but anyone can see that he can definitely do it. Since His Majesty the Pope has already stated that he will deal with all the sub-humans of God, then even if Tatalia surrenders him and his people, it is probably a dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This method is really not working...." The Chief of the Trosars tried to cough and cough as much as possible to raise their voices without being overwhelmed by the roar around them. Although his own lucid and sleek mind feels that it does not matter on the surface, he does not care, but he also knows that other patriarchs and their own people will never agree. He stood up and waved his hand to calm the others. He asked the King Taize again slowly and forcefully: "Even if we form an alliance with Oufu, can we be better than this result?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaders are quiet and look at the king waiting for this answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of Taize also silenced and looked at the corner intently or unconsciously and said, "I think it is still possible to have confidence in them." The human eye followed again to observe the two bodies again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excitable leaders are a little excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this meeting has almost always been carried out in a strange atmosphere. The two bodies reminded everyone who was there that the person who was there had shaken the back of the card that had thrown the shadow of the shadow that had made them fearful. This is especially true for those who advocate the use of force and fear and fear of the shadow sage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shadow Sage rarely appears in front of people. He will not show any goodwill to anyone except those he thinks are necessary. However, once someone angered him, the end must be miserable. So apart from the royal family of the King of Brown, the people in the royal family regarded it as a god to worship and worship everyone who was far from a mysterious and magical fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this fear of the strong has been passed on to the person who killed him, especially when he knows that he is likely to stand on the same line with himself. When. Although everyone is considered as a patriarch, but as a soldier, who is not willing to fight alongside such a man? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't forget that the five thousand soldiers of the Einfast Empire rushed to the result. Ou Fu even injured an orc and let the five elites die. This is not just a manifestation of combat effectiveness, but also a description of their strategies and means." King Taize appropriately mentioned this allusion. "The Einfast Empire has signed a peace covenant with Oufu. The dwarves in the Karundo Basin have always had a good relationship with them. Their situation is not a mess. After all, the fighting beasts on the wild highlands can occupy absolute The advantage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And everyone knows that church pigs are not all fanatics. Their timid and weak guys see too much The blood will also be too soft to see too many bodies but can't change the benefits they deserve. Those devout politicians will immediately forget their God's change to economic rational thinking. Because their God is not It will really come to give them soldiers gold coins. Then they will reconsider whether such a war is necessary or not. Does Erasia really dare to lose the national strength to the wild land? They dare not guard Nigan? Isn’t that Catherine’s mother want her bedroom to be used by the hens to make a nest, hoping that the Minotaurs rushed into her boudoir to rape her?” King Taize gradually improved his voice. Vision gradually fell to the cadence of those excitable collar face. His ugly and funny face has also become vibrant. Every facial features and tone are combined to drive the emotions of those who listen to his words. "And the church? What can the church do on its own? There is not so much support from the religious state. Celeste is not an idiot where even the gold coins don't know how to make a bread and don't know how to do it? The pastor in the Glorious Castle Can you pray for bread and gold coins by prayer? So in the end, Magnus’s old man is not only recovering his words because of dementia, he admits that Oufu recognizes us Tadalia.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
