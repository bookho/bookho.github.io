			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Garcia, the Earl of Garcia. Earl Garcia has bathed in a satin pajamas and walked into the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bathing he invited is the most famous massage therapist in Elazia carefully massaged the whole body with a blend of fifty gold coins and a bottle of essential oil. He now feels that every inch of his skin is soft and elastic so that he can feel his body hair being swayed in the silk underwear like a girl's skin with the blood running. Every muscle under the clothes that was covered by heavy fat was once again restored. The power was full of violence and restored the state that was still fighting on the battlefield 30 years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just ** He can still feel that his spirit seems to have completely returned to the year. Every drop of blood in every nerve in the body is in a state of vitality. He hasn't felt this for many years. As a military minister of the kingdom, he has enjoyed so much. And if you enjoy too many people, you will be paralyzed. But the prelude to this huge enjoyment is so powerful that the nerves that were already anesthetized are once again excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having been soaked in the officialdom for so many years, his body has been blessed for so many years. But now he feels like a striding walk in the hallway just like a young man who is 18 years old and full of energy and muscle. He suddenly remembered the feeling that he felt the first time he murdered at the age of fifteen and then rushed to the blood when he slammed the robbed girl into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count opened the door and saw the female elf of the plain makeup on the bed. The kind of rush in his body immediately began to boil to explode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale gold long shop is scattered on the snowy white nightdress. The most exquisite workmanship is the most exquisite sculpture. A pair of red lips and a pointed ear. The most important thing is the pure beauty of the female elf without the slightest fireworks. It is as natural as the beautiful fruit taken from the same forest. Can't find a little deliberately carved. That is the woman who grew up in the dusty world, no matter what the beautiful and then moving can't. The horrified and helpless expression on the face of the female elf makes the count feel that his soul is swaying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current day when Count Earl saw this female elf at first sight, he immediately agreed to the request of the gifted Viscount. Although he knows better than anyone else that the acquisition of military needs before the battle of Oufu is a big fat deficiency, at least two or three thousand gold coins in the oil and water kingdom in the position of confrontation, there are no thousand and eight hundred. There are still many people who he is not good to refuse, but he immediately gave this position to the Viscount of the gift without hesitation. He can't refuse such a gift. Although he is a devout believer, but the believers also need to be entertained and need to relax. Otherwise, where does the spirit come to contribute to the great gods? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In time for this wonderful time he spent a day. Also deliberately opened the two sons and wives. He has made up his mind to concentrate on all the energy and time to enjoy this gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl walked to the bed and grabbed the end of the rope of the female elf who had bundled the rope well and untied it. The horror of the elf's face was even more screaming and raised her hand to the count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl grabbed the elf's wrist and effortlessly pushed her down. The female elf has already been immersed in a kind of medicine that is so powerful that it is just right. It just happens to keep her in a form of struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling the delicate and weak struggle of the wrist uploading at such a close distance, watching the beautiful face in full of fear and despair count I heard the low sorrow from my throat. He felt that he was exhaling the fire that the air was burnt by his own blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even he himself feels that reason has been burned under the flame of ** and is smashed into ashes, but when he hears the opening of the door, he is still fierce. The ground jumped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the voice of the count, he heard that the door was not pushed open but kicked off. Anyone who dares to kick in the door in this situation will not be the servant who comes to tea for water anyway. He immediately prepared a perfect set of words ready to deal with the countess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he turned around, he even wondered if his eyes had an illusion and kicked the door. It’s not the expected yellow face. . Actually still a female elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kelene." The female elf on the bed saw the compatriots immediately screamed and the joy in the voice shook the count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full-length black man also walked out of the hallway and hugged his hands in a casual position next to the female elf. The man's height is probably as tall as the female elf, and the face is a mask that seems to be carved out of wood. The lower half of the section covers a black and black pair of eyes and looks at the count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no murderousness or even a smile in those eyes, but the count felt that the skin that had been applied to his essential oil was wrinkling a goose bump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on." The count's voice was distorted, and the sweat rolled down the fat face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To others." The man waved his hand and immediately three people flew in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count clearly sees the three guards who are responsible for protecting him personally. His program today is well arranged in the bedroom, no one around the bedroom, only these three guards are still there. These three are the positions of the captains of the Knights of the Kingdom. They are definitely a first-class loyalty and there is no problem. So the count will let them be their own personal guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they are so quick to appear so quickly that they have nothing to do with their loyalty and skill because they are thrown in and thrown in and fall on the ground. Moved. One of the eyes was so angry that the boss looked at him with amazement and he should never have seen the back of his back and his body with only one half left. There is also a wound on the larynx. But not too much blood flowing out, but it is a kind of blue like oil paint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge Werewolf woman in black and a knives with a slap in the face also came in. The muscles and fats of the count's body were shaking together. He suddenly turned and rushed toward the female elf on the bed. The female elf has been struggling to get up. But the limbs that were sore by the drug could not support herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A green glow flashed past the count and then a large block of muffled bedroom walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't want to die, don't move." The female elf put down the long black bow in her hand and looked at the frigid count coldly. "Although the elders let me try not to kill people, I don't mind killing people like you who are humble. You should be glad that you came outside early. You haven't been to my compatriots, otherwise I will not let you go." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count did not move and he did not want to die. There was a small piece of oil on his nose that was left by the green mans. Of course, he wouldn't think that it was his luck or the prospect of the female elf. A good bluestone wall in the bedroom. Even the strongest warrior can't break open with a big mountain axe. If the green light is aimed at his head. Then his brain has definitely splashed onto the ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl still didn’t move and didn’t seem to be confused but spoke in a steady tone: “I know I won’t move you to save her. Please take her away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female elf suddenly looked at the brain full of fat and despicable humans. In her imagination, this animal should be Hey or the mouse shouldn’t have such calmness and style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count turned slowly with a very reassuring degree. Although his head is still full of cold sweat. But the look is very calm and calm. It’s not just calm, but also honest and humility. I’m honest with an old farmer who has been facing the loess for a lifetime. “She took some medicine that made her muscles weak, but these didn’t hurt her. It’s been a while. As you can see, I did not touch her. She was bought by some robbers and then sent to me. She has been here very well these days. You will know her. I admit to me. Wrong, I am indeed shameless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. This time can still maintain such calm and temperament is the Minister of Military Affairs of Erasia, Count Garcia The black man came over and gently drummed and applauded the count's shoulder. There was more smile in the eyes above the wooden mask. "It's a smart person to see the situation so quickly and make the most sensible and correct choices and attitudes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the place?" Earl honestly Respectfully nodded. “There is a small parcel under the third floor below the bed with a pile of gems worth two thousand gold coins. You can take it if you need it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
