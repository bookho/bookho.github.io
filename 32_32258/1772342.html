			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tauren’s large force is still on the way to Oufu. Although there is a way for the swamp army to open, it is necessary to cross the vast swampy wasteland of Tatalia. Arriving at Oufu is not a short circuit, but the eagle owl has arrived in the air for only a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There weren’t many eagle hens who lost a lot in Othello’s battle, except for the chieftain’s basil, only dozens of fighters escaped. In the purgatory paradise, fortunately, there were still some old, weak, sick and hundreds of eggs in the nest, all of whom arrived at Oufu under the leadership of the Basile Chief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Loire Leigh, how do you think we are in this place? Is it okay to arrange for you?" Bolugan’s proudly pointed at the cliff in front . This is the shady face of a rock mountain outside the city of Orford. The top of the platform is cut out of the material used for the nest, so that the eagle is going to arrange it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, thank you." The eagle demon chief nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloogan adults opened their mouths and smiled, and shot the waist of Luo Leilei very affectionately and said: "Don't thank me. It is the city of Sedros who gives you Arrange, the lizard man will help you. I am just a leader."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five short, thick fingers slid over the skin around the waist Basile's body couldn't help but stiffen, but she resisted, and did not take out the two knives from the waist to cut it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are other places where humans dare to make this move, the only end is to be broken into pieces, but here is Oufu, this dwarf Although the head can be smashed down with a knife, the knife in the hands of the two werewolves guards will not be slower than her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the huge flying beast of the Wyvern, the whole Oufu also shocked the birds who rarely walked out of the ground, especially those who were well equipped. The system is in an orderly manner and does not lose to the orcs of the church swordsmen. This has always been arrogant and unconcerned, and this creature has been hated by human beings. In the bones, the eagle demon chief has to suppress his disgust in the face of this dwarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have heard that you have been copied from the church in the home of Nigan, and you have been burned with a cursed scroll. Is it?” Bolugan asked with a smile and a very affectionate expression and voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roller’s face was black and didn’t speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloogan adults seem to be laughing very nervously: "But don't worry, living here is guaranteed to be much more comfortable than Nien. I listen." Say your prince, Tima High Priest seems to be a genius that the Tauren has rarely seen in a hundred years. Not only the genius of earth magic, but also the mind is super smart..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Roller couldn’t help but turn back and say: "Tima is the leader of the Tauren, and has nothing to do with us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the banshee not the vassal of the Tauren? "Polugan is surprised." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No." Basler screamed. "Oh, no difference." Bolugan said with a silly smile. "In any case, you are together now. You must be right with the Tima priest..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not following him, how can it fall like this? To the point? Are you looking for a dead dwarf? Basile had used a lot of strength to scream and then grabbed the wicked dwarf, but the teeth were already biting. The hens and banshees have never had the habit of screaming at the city. It is very rare to be able to endure such a situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polugan is still laughing, the smile on the big pie-like face seems to be very honest and very nerveless, even the two bulls look so ridiculous . "Let's talk about it again. In the future, everyone will have more time to cooperate. You need to know about it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should learn to be forbearing, the city, Do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When night. When the basil priest and the priest of Tima gathered together, the high priest said to her solemnly. He could see that Basile's expression was different from usual, and he was very angry and strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you mean that I want to learn from those who believe in treacherousness?" Basile looked at Tima's high priest's eyes very strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now is not in Niegen now. Now the environment is different, you must adapt to the environment and learn to adapt to the new environment. I know that you have always looked down The hypocrisy and snobbery of mankind, but I want to tell you that this is not despicable and not desirable. It is a power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tima High Priest is very Shaohe said so many words, and never taught anyone like this. The nature of the Tauren does not like to share his own things with people, but he now wants a patient teacher to teach students. Although the banshee genie is not much left now, it is also his only true ally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In order to get the ultimate long-term goal, restraining the impulse to give up should give up and control your emotions. This is a kind of ability. It is far more than the physical ability." A stronger and more useful ability is the ability that can be done in a big event. What despises such despicable hypocrisy and prides itself on what pure blood is, that is the reason why the weak are excusing themselves and self-righteous. Distorted a bit, looked at the Tauren Chieftain, a long-time partner with a very strange look, and immediately sighed and nodded and said, "I understand. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tima priest couldn’t help but slowly nodded and breathed a sigh of relief. He now has few cards in his hands, and every card needs to be well grasped. , use it well. "The current situation is that Sedros needs us, so we can settle in Oufu. In their eyes we are just tools, because we are outsiders after all, so we must be more united. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sedros is certainly not at ease with us, and I am even more skeptical that he still wants to completely annex our two people, so we both are special leaders of the tribe. Be careful, always be together as much as possible in any situation. "The priest of Tima sighed heavily, and stretched out the wide palm to pat the thin, shoulder-shouldered eagle chief. "I know that we will blame me when we fall to the present, please forgive me." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Basile's expression was very strange, probably because she had never seen such a gentle and modest expression and wording of this ally. The strength of the demon and the Tauren are not in contrast. Although it is said that the two races are allies, the dictatorship is always the priest of Tima.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The situation is very difficult. We should be more united and help each other. "The Tema Grand Priest is very satisfied, which shows that her heart is very touched.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The strength of our two communities cannot be independent, we must rely on Europe blessing. In this case, the spiritual beliefs and cohesiveness of our two communities are the most important conditions for guaranteeing that they are not annexed by Oufu, so the identity of both of us is very important. Sedros will naturally understand this, so I am somewhat worried that he will start with us both. Fortunately, the church and Oufu are fighting, and he is not too risky to let go. But in any case, we must be careful, we must not reveal the slightest attempt, nor leave them with any handle. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What we need is time, to become familiar with the city, let the orcs here completely accept us and slowly establish our status and prestige." Yes. We have a chance, you have to know that humans and orcs are not very long-lived, and that Sedros is old........."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tima The high priest patiently explained to Basile, induced, and slowly instilled something that she did not understand and was not good at. The eagle patriarch chief listened carefully, from time to time thinking about the confused expression. Tima High Priest Not worried, he knows that Basile is not stupid. Regarding the mentality and the powers, the previous disrespect is not a big problem. As long as she induces her to have this habit and way, she will slowly become herself. Familiarity, habits, and sophistication. This is actually like a young man and a girl who are unaccompanied. As long as they are induced to experience the rest, they don’t have to worry about it. Their own desires will guide them.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, two monks brought the words of Sedros, and today the adults of the city invited them to visit the farmland on the edge of the swamp.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;On the Wyvern, the two soon came to the swamp The edge, a large piece of orderly innocent leaning against the swamp forest, but some strangely did not see the orcs busy in the field, Sedros alone waiting.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; After a brief greeting, Sedros smiled and said to the two: "In fact, the main purpose of today is to invite you to see someone. please follow me. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
