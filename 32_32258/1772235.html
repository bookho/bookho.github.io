			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the great priest walked into the dungeon, he saw the Cardinal and the Marquis came out. The calmness of the two faces seems to have nothing to do. The great priest was relieved. He had just faintly heard the muffled sound from the dungeon. He could still feel the mixture of silk magic and vindictiveness. He thought that the following battle had been born and he hurriedly rushed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing. The Marquis came to give me the words of the Pope." Bishop Jia Wei gestured to the great priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan’s eyes were turned around in the Cardinal and the Marquis. He could not see the complexity of the Bishop’s adult. What is wrong with it. Although he is puzzled by the eccentric expression of the young bishop who has been a deep city, he understands that what he has in life does not want to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javier Bishop’s eyes flashed on his face and seemed to be more fluctuating than before. After a moment of silence, he finally decided to make up his mind and said, "You brought the Marquis to see the prisoner... just remember to bring the Marquis into it and then you don't care..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Although it is still very puzzled, it feels that something seems to be a little bit right, but the reaction of Ryan's great priest is clearer. Old people like him who have no blood and fighting spirits understand that the more they are in this unpredictable period, the more likely they are to have a hidden background. The more you don't want to go deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are all the monsters in the area that have been restored to the original state. I have already been executed. Without my permission, others will not go any longer. I will go to Rhodes first. There are some things for the extraordinary people..." Although the voice of the cardinal is somewhat exhausted, the tone is imperative. It seems that he has accepted the School of Magic in a logical way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priest thought about it and seemed to be thinking about what attitude he should take, but he finally nodded and answered: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;After closing the tunnel entrance. Ryan’s great priest led the Marquis to the dungeon where the prisoners were held. On the way, he asked like a slap in the face: "Because Hamm had already done something for His Majesty the Pope in Celeste? The principal of the prisoner said that he had to be sent to Celest to hand over to His Majesty..." The prince smiled and replied: "No, I am not in Leicester. It is also our privilege to just worry about the Pope’s occasion. It’s a pity for the prisoner. He is frustrated, so I will come and deal with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well..." The Great God official can't find any exact clues from these words. Continue to be a steady and steady look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School of Magic is not a small one from the cathedral to the prisoner's dungeon for more than ten minutes. When Ryan's great priest saw the open dungeon door and several pastors and guards on the ground, he was so steady that he almost jumped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone hijacked." The great priest immediately rushed over. The look of the Marquis also dipped in an instant and went up to see what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few guards on the ground were stunned by heavy methods. Two of them were also stripped of only underwear. Here, it was just a remote mantle. There were no people around at all, so no one actually reported the police. And these guards and pastors are obviously not getting the chance to shout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priest raised a priest’s hand and the white magic flashed continuously, and the priest slowly opened his eyes. The great sergeant asked: "What's wrong? How many people attacked you? What kind of person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor struggled to answer and almost let the big god official jump Get up: "I'm sorry. I was stunned when I didn't know anything..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis did not care about the priests who were stunned. He took a look. The iron gate of the cellar was intact and was not violently knocked open but the lock on the top was broken. The cross-section of the lock surface is not very neat. It can be seen that there is still some strange sag on the cross section of the cut-off weapon. If it is someone else, you may not see what is going on. But the Marquis can see it at a glance. This is the melting effect of the fire system or the dark magical force that can be concentrated in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards are facing the floor. This method of unlocking the lock with magic can be silent. It would be possible if the person's movements were quicker to open the door and then stun them all before these completely unsuspecting guards did not respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the dungeon is a strange heat wave. The steel bar of the cage was not damaged by the slightest damage, or the lock on the top was dissolved by magic. On the ground in the center of the cage is a cracked ground. That is the special trace left behind by high temperature baking. It seems that someone has set up a stove here and burned it for three days and three nights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this? This...there is a big magician in the fire department? But the magical magic squad around it is still intact. What is going on...” Ryan’s great priest also saw these strange traces screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis looked at the crack on the ground and showed a thoughtful expression. He took a deep breath and sighed in the cellar. What is implied in the heat means that his face is getting ugly and slowly, and finally there is some horror and anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. You are going to inform Bishop Jiawei that I am going to call the man to start the hunt..." The great official turned to the Marquis but when he turned his head The time when the Marquis was actually gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Asa and Jessica are being guarded and brought into the Prime Minister’s Office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They both wore clothes that were stripped from the stunned pastor. The mask that has been worn has been baked into ashes. He now has to smear some temporary dust on his face. Although it seems a little weird, the lie of sending the letter from the magic school's clothes and the adult master is brought in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards brought them into the study room of the Prime Minister’s office. The little sergeant in an official uniform is leaning on the desk and looking at the documents absently. It can be seen from her expression and eyes that her mood does not seem to be good these days. Hearing that the person is already, she just asked her head. "What happened? What happened to Bishop Jiawei? He was here for me in the past two days. I was looking for someone to ask him not to come..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The matter of the prime minister, what I have reported is very confidential, please let others evade it?" Asa bowed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small and awkward. She heard the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the priest is secretive, I will report that you will retreat for the time being. Bring the door and remember that there is no order from me. No one is allowed to come in to know." What?” Xiao Yan took a deep breath and said to the guards and the two registrars and secretaries next to him in as quiet a tone as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has stepped out of the study door and closed it. Asa used a hand to wipe all the camouflage on his face and turned it into powder. He looked up and smiled at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is acidity and bitterness in this smile. There is no longer any concern about shame in the past. The spring breeze in the wilderness gives all the emotions in my heart to the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;小懿 is also a smile. Neither of them spoke. This time the language is already superfluous. Discourse is a tool for conveying emotions. But the real emotions are not what the statement can carry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa strode to the face of Xiao Yan. Stretched her hand and put her in her arms. Whispered: "I'm sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small sneak peek at his different actions from the past but then melted in this once in countless times in memories and dreams The hinter in the middle of the earth said softly: "Is nothing sorry for fools."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the arms is so soft and warm, like all the warmth and softness of this private It is here at the moment. Every inch of the body's skin feels this gentle. It feels straight to the deepest part of the mind. The nose again smelled her smell again. I used to think that I had forgotten this shame, but it was not until this time I relived that the fragrance was actually imprinted in the deepest part of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already tears in the corner of the eye. It is not sadness or too much joy, but it suppresses the comfort of accumulated emotions. He put his mouth on her dry lips and felt the gentleness of her silky water and said softly: "I'm sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid." She There are tears in the corners of the eyes. Just smiling and clenching him to repeat that sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of the room, the black elf looks at the two people who are together. Her eyes and expressions are very strange and complicated but they can distinguish the most important one. It is lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed softly and said, "You absolutely can't think of who the guy is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the person we met before?" asked Xiao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just a matter of knowing." Asa smiled. "In fact, even if I feel it now, it is really hard to believe the true identity of the guy... I can’t think of that guy actually still hasn’t died yet. I’ll use this identity to come back here... I don’t think you’re relieved, there’s me in me. Will protect you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you talking about?" Xiao Yan asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time the door of the study was suddenly opened. One person pushed the door and smiled and said with a polite and apologetic voice: "I'm sorry to disturb."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;小懿 and Asa are reflectively separated It is. And Asa immediately remembered that his face is now without any cover. He hurriedly wanted to turn and bow his head while vindictive and magical power condensed in his hand. But just as he turned back, he saw this coming in person suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiao Xiao also saw this time when people came to be surprised: "Marquis adults?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Hey? How are you here?" The Marquis looked at Asa’s face with a surprise expression. He walked over and smiled and reached out to the shoulders of Asa. "I haven't seen you in such a day. Are you okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis's expression is indeed very friendly and it is natural to see a acquaintance that has not been seen for a long time. The reaction of the time even Asa’s brain subconsciously rushed up the friendly memory of this old acquaintance. He felt that he felt like a good feeling and couldn’t talk about any wariness. But Asa looked at the hand that showed closeness and friendliness without the slightest fireworks, but knew that it would be best not to let him touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not an intuition. Intuitively, he even has a good impression on this person. The idea is that his wariness and thinking are judged in a few short blinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he said that he would not be wary of this person. But now that I know the true identity of Bishop Jia Wei, the identity of this person has to be cast a strange shadow. Although the hands are really soft and powerless. Without the slightest vindictiveness and magical fluctuations, I was willing to squeeze it into the sauce in a tenth of a second, but the strange appearance of this person in this strange environment made him have to be wary. So Asa stretched out his hand and bypassed the friendly palm to catch his wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palm is still so soft and weak, but it is still very slow and friendly. It was shot to Asa to catch the wrist of his wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa’s hand is stretched. This time, he has already brought the vindictiveness and the sound of wind and thunder. As long as he is caught by him, even a whole piece of marble will be crushed into pieces. And he made a lot of effort to grab the arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Marquis’s hand slowly changed his direction slightly and greeted Asa’s palm. Not only did the hand not have the slightest vindictiveness, but the muscles were not very good. It seemed that there was no good end when it touched the bulging hand. But even the Marquis seemed to want to shoot at any cost. Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the other party wants to shoot. Then you must not let him shoot. For this strange thought and thought, Asa had to close again. And this time because he was overpowered when he shot. Therefore, this closing actually had to take a step back. The floor under the foot made an unpleasant scream. His foot actually stepped on the floor and fell half an inch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis also retired. However, he did not have Asa retreat from Mars. His movements are still so casual and a big step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance between Asa and Otaru is very close to the Marquis. This step seems to be directly or unintentionally retreated to Otaru. Asa’s face changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the Marquis adults came in, did the outside people stop you?" Although Xiao Xiao saw the strange movement between the two hands, she still did not Understand what is going on. She suddenly arrived that she had ordered that no one should be approached. She has always had a good impression on the Marquis and has always had a friendly and friendly smile on the Marquis' face, so that she has no precautions. Just feel very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
