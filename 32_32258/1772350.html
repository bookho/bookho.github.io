			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phoenix mouth in the dive, the overwhelming flame spurts out from below, transforming the area of ​​a glorious castle into a sea of ​​fire. The screams are afraid to ring in the sea of ​​fire. Many priests have become coke in this flame. This is not an ordinary magical flame, but a spit similar to a dragon. The elemental protection of a magician can hardly play any role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of lions flew from the outer edge of the Glorious Castle, the gryphon knights above, or the bows or the magic, all shot toward the phoenix The magician below also tried to send magic to the sky, but neither the fireball nor the ice arrow seemed to have any effect on this huge firebird, which is said to be immortal. The phoenix, with a dazzling flame, rushed toward the birds that were much smaller than the gryphon several times faster, but with a huge body and a flap, these can be <br /> Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raptor who tore the beasts fell like a group of fired flies from above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient elf empire once contend with this magical creature and the dragon, this is not any of the existing creatures can fight. Even the two-legged dragon is as fragile as a bat in front of the phoenix, not to mention other flying beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone don't panic, all go with me to the bright hall." Looking up at the behemoth, the pope's face is ugly, but there is no panic. He turned and ran in the direction of the Great Hall of Light. Throw it to Lancelot, "Catch this kid. If you need to cut your hands and feet if necessary, you can do it as long as he is alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glory Castle Almost half of it has been submerged in the sea of ​​fire. The huge body of the phoenix phoenix slammed into the prominent spire on the spire of the towering sky. The entire glorious castle trembled. The tall tower broke from it and fell down into a house. Have to smash. The place where the fire phoenix directly hit the middle ground was scattered into a full moon of masonry, which was scattered with the fire and rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire Glorious Castle is already hot like a desert where eggs can be cooked, and the place where the phoenix flies past can burn. For the priests of Shining Castle, this legendary god bird is now like the demon summoned in purgatory. Continue this way, no flames, but this high temperature can kill everyone in Celeste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ten-way lightning and the icy ice flew out of the ground, and there were two high-order magics like thunderous bombs. All these magics were hit. On the body of the phoenix, the ice of the phoenix dissipated some of the flames on the surface of the phoenix, and then the lightning and thunder bombs all blew up on the body of the phoenix. The huge body surrounding the flame in the roar was shaken, and the thunderous bomb blasted under the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the attack by the more than a dozen mages did not cause much damage to the phoenix. After an angry whistle, the phoenix swooped to the ground, overwhelming The flames spurted out of the mouth, and the dozens of magicians were burnt to ashes even if they were too screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, there was a hint of chill in the hot air. Numerous condensed water elements forcibly aired a snowflake, which, although almost impossible to form, was re-evaporated in an instant, but it cooled the air a lot. Gradually, the more water elements in the air condense, the condensed snow does not evaporate into steam instantly, but becomes a raindrop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground was originally a little hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests and magicians have gathered in the square before the shining hall. Several high-order water masters waved their arms and mourned that the mantra was all casting the magic of the ice storm. The low-level magic has little effect on this amazing elemental creature, and the battle mage in the church is the best, and the most powerful fire magic hits the phoenix's body just to add vitality to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white magic of the pastors is not of much use to the strange creatures constructed by this element, but all the priests in the square are concentrating on mourning the prayers. Text, but the light of Bethune magic shines on their bodies. Instead, the Great Hall of Light seems to resonate with the priests around, a faint white light shining on the main hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solitary dome of the Glorious Hall stands alone, a pope. There wasn't a guard around him, just looking up and rolling over the phoenix, and the hall at the foot glowed in the prayers of the pastors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prepare, put." Sylvia in the mage array loudly ordered. With his voice, hundreds of magicians who have gathered together have all released magic to the Phoenix. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splitary attacks seem to have no effect on this monster. This is an attack on hundreds of magical episodes. Although the elemental magicians in the Glorious Castle are mostly dominated by the most destructive fire spells, the Masters of the Glory are still not to be underestimated. There are also a few high-level Masters among the hundreds of Masters. The mage also took out the reel that he carried with him, and the boulder in this wave of magical waves slammed, and high-order spells such as thunder bombs were not in the minority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phoenix also noticed the power of this attack. The air was overwhelmed with incredible dexterity and speed. Most of the spells were smothered, but its body is actually It is too large, the scope of magic coverage is too wide, and there are still a small half magic hitting it on the body. The flames flutter in the violent explosion, the huge feathers fly through the sky, and immediately become pure fire elements by the ice storm. Neutralized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scream of the phoenix just sounded, and the golden bow of the hands of Wileske made a huge humming sound, and the glory of the martial arts took off. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now he also tried his usual industrial steel to break the magic arrow, but no matter how fast the speed and destructive power of the devil arrow, as soon as it touches the fire phoenix The flames around him were immediately accepted as iron. This arrow was purely made with all his own vindictiveness. The arrow-like vindictiveness shot on the phoenix at a speed several times higher than the magic, and the screaming noise, then the phoenix gave a louder scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This arrow is more harmful to the phoenix than the high-order magic such as the thunderstorm, and the phoenix’s body is slightly skewed, and the fire feathers are scattered. Brought a lava-like golden blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bang of the bang, the flame of the Phoenix body is like an oil-filled explosion, and it has already flourished under the violent snow. The cold air instantly became hot and hot. The phoenix is ​​still calling, but it is not a scream, but the scream of this pain that provokes fury. As soon as the huge body turned, he swooped toward the Guangming Hall with the flame that was violently raging thousands of times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Masters who can use the water magic in the Great Hall Square have all their mana being poured out, even the few magicians who used the ice storm stopped. The method of casting, desperately using the water system to neutralize the heat wave that is going to burn people. The raging phoenix is ​​not a flame, but a sea of ​​fire. Its momentum is no longer the same as that of the previous one. It is to use its own body to crush this piece into a crushed scorched earth. Everything is burned to ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this huge body with a swoop of fire, hundreds of priests in the square did not dodge or panic, they are still mourning from The prayers that have been mourning just now, and the white light on the Great Hall of Light is getting stronger and stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the name of the Lord, broken." A magnificent voice came from the mouth of the Pope on the top of the Great Hall of Light. With this sound, the white light that surrounds the entire bright hall instantly dissipates, and the pope's body shines brightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope’s body has been completely submerged in this concentrated light, which is as bright as the essence. In the next moment, this substantial ray of light made a huge white light sword, and the face spurred the fire phoenix that swooped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightsaber emerged from the change and condensed and spurted out of the air, and it was just the phoenix swooping, and this is not just the Pope. The power, but the power of the hundreds of high-ranking pastors together with him through the bright hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white lightsaber silently passed through the chest of the phoenix, almost dividing the huge flamingo into two. The sky full of fire clouds disappeared in an instant, and the phoenix's imposing body swooped away and flew away to the side like a kite that had only broken the line. The lava-like blood spewed out of its body. However, it has evaporated in the air without dissipating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a thousand winds." "Long live your majesty." The phoenix was dying and sorrowful, and it was the cheer of the shining castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s already a mess, there are many dead and injured people, but they all see how such a mythical legendary horror behemoth falls down. This is the manifestation of the Pope’s supreme majesty and ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
