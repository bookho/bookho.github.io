			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To break a piece of paper, a palm and a finger are all possible, but the strength of the finger is more concentrated, but the scope of the broken is small. This clip of Asa's hands made the Tamik Knight's knife a finger that could break himself and a finger that only penetrated himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big blood rushes out of Asa’s mouth. Even if this resistance to concession has been very successful, but after all his chest has been penetrated. This blood is directly sprayed to the Tamek Knight holding the knife in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long knife has penetrated the other body, as long as you swipe or stir it, you can completely kill this opponent, but the Tamik Knight only Flying back, the blood that sprayed on his face was not red, but black as ink and smelly like a hand washing water in the fish stall for more than a year. The curse magic in this knife has been all in this blood, and it is also mixed with his own dead spirit, and it may be worse than being sprayed on the face with such a blood. So the Tamik Knight had to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the retreat of the Tamik Knights, the two men’s physiques finally separated. But one is standing and the other is stumbling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." The Tamek Knight first opened. He did not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I never praised people, but I have to praise you. I have set up a trap and used a full blow, you are still not dead. , so I have to say, you are good. Ai line is not dead, you can have such skills and mental judgment at such age, you can definitely be above me and Lancelot. You are I was the first to want to kill, but some were reluctant to kill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa did not speak, he could not speak. It is a miracle that all the lungs are worn to reveal a large fist hole. He is now busy coughing up blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now you tell me where the strange smell can be, take me to find it. I won't kill you, take you back to see you." "Tamik Knight looked at Asa, who was kneeling on the ground." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you want to kill me?" Asa used the white magic to suppress the injury that could not be injured. I can barely speak. With each of his words there will be a small mouthful of blood coughing out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have lost now, I can kill you at any time. I have completely won, killing you is not just a formal problem." Tamik The knight's expression returned to the kind of plain and faint. Looking at Asa’s eyes is no longer murderous. Such an enemy who is so strong that he can raise his killings is finally falling under his own traps and knives. He has a strange sense of satisfaction, just as a man who has been abstinent for many years suddenly has a relaxed and enjoyable encounter. He even got a little more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thamik Knight can see that the bloody white hole in the bloody hole of Asa’s chest is a rebirth of the bishop’s level, for this high-level recovery. He was slightly surprised. This magic can really save his life in such a fatal injury, and even recover slowly. However, this is a serious injury. Even the white magic of the Pope's majesty is impossible to restore to the point where you can do it yourself. So in the eyes of the Takmi Knight. This person is no different from a dead body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is still squatting. But it has not coughed up blood. He did not answer the words of the Tamik Knight, but slowly asked: "I just had this accident,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know that Abin good boy will betray you?"姆 /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamik Knight shook his head and said: "Not a betrayal, he was not my own. I know that he will definitely shoot in that situation, just don't know He wouldn’t even want to stab me a sword and even his arms and life.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They were already bright in your heart." Asa looked at the Knights of Tamik. The woody face shook his head and sighed. This pair of mop faces and minds<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; completely disproportionate. The purpose of his leaving Abin was actually to make himself think that he had a chance, and this was a big move. If it wasn't for Abin, he would stab him a sword, and he wouldn't be able to pick up the knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tamik Knight raised his knife and said coldly, "Don’t use nonsense to delay the time. You know you have no chance. Answer me, where is that thing? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tamik Knight was slightly surprised. This is actually a level of white magic, god grace. This made him a little more amazed, two consecutive high-level white magic, he believes that even the magical power of a real cardinal will not be much. What's more, this is similar to the dead. It just makes him recover some of his ability to act. There is still no room for him to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The thing you want is inside, the breath is sealed by the spell on the pocket, and you can see it as soon as you unlock it." Sa got a pocket from the waist and threw it to the Tamik Knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamik Knight looked coldly at the bulging pocket on the ground, he did not reach out and squat, but also for a moment, suddenly one foot I kicked my pocket in front of Asa and said, "You untied me and took it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? You suspect that I am a ghost?" Asa Hey, then smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You open it for me, take it out." The Knight of Tamik stood on the ground and repeated, and he didn't even want to approach Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiles. "The smell of good stuff Since you have already felt the ground, you should imagine what the body is. I don't have the slightest temper now, how dare I take it with empty hands?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it turns out to be like this." The Knights of Tamik nodded and paused again. "Then you unbutton your pocket and let me see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa only smiled a little bit, slowly changed his waist and picked it up. Pocket, to solve the rope tied to the pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamik Knight still stood still, just watching Asa slowly untied the rope of the bag. He did not relax at all, and the knife in his hand was still tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bag was finally untied in the hands of Asa. Asa opened his pocket in the direction of the Tamik Knight. The darkness of the sea surged out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already dawn, and the dawn has made everything in this forest clear and clear, but the Tamik Knight still feels the blackness of the head. He clearly saw everything, but he felt black. He knew that the pocket was indeed what he had seen outside the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, it is this..." The Tamik Knight nodded. However, he turned around and found that the black was suddenly increasing at a speed of thousands of times, approaching, and even appearing in shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out to be a small cylindrical thing, suddenly protruding the pocket and flying quickly toward the Tamik Knight. The darkness of this little thing is as thick and unfathomable as the ocean. And this dark sea is being pressed against the real sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although knowing that this is just an imposing, just breath, there may not be any actual damage, but the Tamik Knight is still slamming toward the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of this small object is not too fast, the Tamik Knight is easy to flash, and then it hits a plant not far away The big tree, like a piece of soft mud, fell into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamik Knight stood still, the surprise in his heart was no longer added, he was not surprised that Asa actually shot the thing out of the pocket, but surprised himself Actually will go to dodge. At that moment, he was completely out of control. A long-lost instinct completely controlled him. Let him not even think about it and escape the things he had always wanted. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the thirteen winds slowly slashed his father in training, his nerves were already as tough as steel wires. All instinct, feelings, and impulses can be controlled like a top-of-the-line magical couple, even thinking can be as precise as metal mechanics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just facing the momentum of the flying little things, he actually felt a totally uncontrollable impulse rushing out of his body . The original wire-like nerve melted instantly in this ferocious hot, magma-like impulse, and the body itself shed the most instinctive melon, dodging. The smell and connotation in this breath are the most essential. In the face of this breath, all the will, perseverance and feelings trained by the day after tomorrow can be completely fragile. Any life in front of it has only a tight instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
