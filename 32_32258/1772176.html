			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa felt the strong sense of the dead spirit in front of him. He knew that this must have been the one used by Helikus. It was made by him and Cedros, and in order to achieve this seemingly impressive effect, he spent two days meditation and injecting his not-so-dead necromantic magic and used a lot of preciousness. The magic items of the extreme include a small piece of magic jade. But it seems that such a cost seems to be worth the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is... Necromancer?" Bill's old man on the shoulder of the werewolf also felt the front of the magical fluctuations, or if the werewolf helped him, he almost fell. Fall and fall. The Druid who became a werewolf also screamed and didn't know that he felt the same magical fluctuations with his nature or because the old man of Bill had caught him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika still stood up with his hands and swords and looked at the few people who should have played with the elves and killed you. They are together with other elves. This scene even caused a short gap in his mind. Although the face was completely different from the previous one, he was not surprised by the fact that after revealing this face, he could bring the other four people to run in the elves. Although there were elves looking at his face with horror, but the elders who were running alongside the other side did not block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the air still has a strange stickyness, people can’t run fast, but when Helicia is awkward, Asa rushes into the black magical area. It is. As he rushed into the magical area, the white smothered light flashed and Helicia’s surprise continued. Druid only stepped in and immediately screamed and hurriedly withdrew. Only Hilton and Jessica, though two steps slower, rushed in with Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Hicika’s incredible look and expression, he didn’t wait for him to open Asa. Very powerful. A very rhythmic and deliberate voice spits out one word at a time. Let the surrounding elves listen very clearly: "Sorry, I am undercover. I am actually lurking in you. I am a friend of the elves to help them deal with you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color of surprise on the face of Helica slowly turned into anger, and the anger gradually accumulated and finally became a smile, and he laughed. Laughter sounds like a hippo in the sticky air. "Undercover? Friends? You play me? Good...* you..." He laughed and slammed on the belly of the wizard's belly. The sound of the rupture of the abdominal cavity and the screams of the elf Master's screaming in the air and his laughter mixed together like a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this horror laughter comparable to the horror laughter, the red temperament of the whole body of Helicika shines. He rushed forward. The two-handed sword with the air set off and smashed into the ground and screamed toward Asa. At the same time, the red vindictive light is also redder, like a bloody armor on the body. The huge muscles that accumulate on the huge body and the murderous face that has been distorted by murderousness and anger seem to be no longer personal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sword long knife short. And this sword is awkward. But it is more effective and more lethal than any big and big. In any case, the dodge will be touched by the sword under the power of this sword. He did not forget that even a sword that was smothered by this smug might not be completely defended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing to do. Asa only has a knife crossing. The blade and the sword end collide in the air of this variability and the impact of the explosion is the same. The elves can feel the waves caused by the collision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s body flew back like a stone. If it weren’t for this sticky air, I’m afraid he would fly out of this black magical area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muscles and bones of both hands are almost exploding like Asa’s heart. This is actually his own initiative to retreat, but even then there is no way to completely eliminate the power of this sword. It is true that the gap is too big from the strength of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silika again snarls like a beast and steps back to the same sword. This sword brought out a thunderous thunderous sound to seal Asa's shelter. Even in terms of skill, the thief’s experience of immersing himself in decades of killing and fighting is not Asaby’s. The timing and power of this sword are first class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s another hard hit. Asa retreats. He is almost unsettled by the people. Although he may have the upper hand in degree and agility, it is useless in the area where the air has been mutated by magic. In the case of hundreds of elves around, the Necromancer is best not to make a mess, so there is no way he can only block. He is the one who is more than an animal and an animal than a beast and a beast. This is a beast of fighting and killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, aren't you always playing me? Don't you want me to stop? You run, what do you run, how do I stop?" Helica stepped over to Asa and walked on one foot and stepped on one while still trying to climb outside. Female elf archer on the head. The female elf's face, which is absolutely rare as a human being, was trampled with the head and the show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hilton and Jessica who followed up saw the situation not happening and immediately rushed to Helicia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha... Are you undercover? I don’t think there are so many undercovers." The smile and voice on Sirika’s face are like a freshly eaten. The same as the madman of human flesh. The giant swords of both hands swept away with the bang of the wind. Only his great strength in this air can offset the air adhesion. Only this two-handed sword can maintain this level of peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hilton and Jessica both dare not resist them knowing they can't resist them only flash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in such an air, the two people were dizzy because of the surrounding magical magic. At least the flash is not complete. Hilton had to put two punches on his arm. I want to unload force obliquely. To be honest, his skills and judgments are indeed first-class, but this force is still unloading because it is too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two steel swords are not considered thin. Hilton used them to cut countless arms and thighs and heads. But now under the rubbing of the two-handed sword, it seems that two pieces of glass are all plunged into Hilton's arm. The screams that Hilton should have been the same as killing pigs sounded like pigs were killed in the quilt, but it wasn't because the pieces were because the bones in him were similar to the pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica had a Hilton block and was just rubbed by the giant sword on his shoulder. The sharp Jianfeng brought a flesh and blood because of the tremendous power. But at the same time, the two blue daggers were also thrown out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the distance is so close in the environment that specifically prevents the arrow, these two shorts are enough to hit the target. But the two short swords only left two thin blood marks on the chest and abdomen of Helicika. Under the bloody red temper, the muscles like the granite fortress can leave these two blood marks. These two short swords are sharp and abnormal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood oozing from the blood marks is blue. Hilika smashed. Then he slammed and screamed at the bloody red scent of the two blue blood arrows that immediately spewed out of the wound and then gradually turned red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica didn’t take this opportunity to attack and even the idea seemed to be turned and fled. She knows best that even an elephant can't last long under that toxin. And Hilika can actually force the poison out. This is enough to show that he is at least much stronger than an elephant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hilton has also been able to escape the role of both of them. At this time, Asa had already returned to the scope of the giant sword that had penetrated into Helicia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika returned to the sword in time. Asa was so embarrassed that he couldn't help but draw a hole in Helicika's arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika is as terrible as a cow. This mouth is much smaller than the two poisonous wounds just now. Even the blood didn't flow out, but the wound was a bit gray. But Hilika’s reaction was much more intense, and even the red vindictive light seemed to be faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two immediately re-bounced together after a minute, but this time there was no such huge collision. Assassin's two-handed swords range Asa no longer occludes, just hides a little and only removes the key points, but the knife in his hand is desperate to stab and slash. Helica became cautious and even though he had a chance to unload his opponent's shirt, but he was not willing to be stabbed on himself by the knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heads on both sides are dazzled and others are not free. Hilton and Jessica, who escaped from the black area, were immediately better at the treatment of several Elven Masters. The wizard's healing spells were no worse than White Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Sisi uses a scroll to support the black magical area and can't make use of magic. Bill's old man is now the only person who has the ability to attack outside. He had already waved the eccentric wand like a feather duster and sipped it to Hilika several times, but Hilika did not wave his sword to the wind. Instead, the elves around watched and danced and danced and cast a strange look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill's old man immediately shifted his target to the next thief, and after a wave of screaming, another thief blew and fell to the ground. The sorcerer's partial magic is not effective for the strong willpower, especially for those who are deeply rooted in the soul, but ordinary people cannot defend against it. Like ordinary thieves, people who have a heartless mind and no faith and no will are just the opposite. But there are more than two hundred thieves. Even if the old man of Bill was slowly waving and killing there, he was enough to kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the thieves are obviously not like this. No one knows if the next goal of the chicken feather wand will be himself. The thieves who bundled the elves' captives did not dare to step out of the black area to deal with the old man. Then there were several hand-picked handcuffs. Asahi and Hilika went to battle with Asa. The elves have just provided evidence for them. In such an air, long-distance weapons cannot be far away, but it is not a problem to shoot a few meters away. And it doesn't require much lethality as long as it can have some effect on that opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea is of course very good. But when the thieves rushed forward, they were screaming at Helicia. He yelled at the thieves who wanted to help: "All of them will be rolled out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the thieves haven't had time to roll Asa and at the same time, they slammed out of the circle and shouted: "It's good." It smashed into a thief's body with a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief’s body smashed and smashed. The other thieves did not even turn around and ran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika roared and rushed up. However, Asa did not care that he left the body that was no different from the pocket and turned to catch up with a thief who had already condensed a blood knife and stabbed the thief's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the body of the second thief is deformed faster. The knife seemed to have a strong sucking ‘吱吱’ sound. Xilika stood still and did not pursue it again. He remembers how the knife in the basement cut off two huge magical elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood from the Asa knife is directly condensed into a huge knife. The vindictive light on the body of Hirschka is redder because it is fresh and seems to beat blood and life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika stood in the eyes of the man who glared at the knife and the knife as if he were going to bleed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surprise of the elves outside the black area is the biggest. Almost all of them exclaimed. The sticky air was filled with this thick bloody smell. It seems that everyone is breathing blood in a huge blood pool. Many elves have vomited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a lot of evil. Everyone is letting go." A sound that was still clear in this heavy air came. The elves who had been sturdy outside had immediately opened a gap. In the center of the Elf city, two outstanding female elves are running under the leadership of other elves. They all have something shining on their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s Elder Luya and Karin Patrol." A lot of elves cheered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one of the two female elves who wears long robes is Luya. Her looks and posture are beautiful even in the contrast of many elves. Unparalleled and held in her hand is the leaf of the world tree that spreads endless greenness and vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other female elf next to Luya is taller and stronger than Lulu and other elves, even the elves’ original slender faces are resolute. And British. On her hand, a black bow with a dark black bow and arrow is a touch of black light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two saw the situation in the venue. The black dead spirit magical area is terrible, and the two corpses are still facing the two. They all exclaimed in unison. In particular, the female elf, known as Karin, was even more eager to crack her and set the black bow on her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves' bows are usually very simple and mostly wooden and have no decoration. But this bow, which is significantly larger than the other bows, is not like a woody black bow with a strange brilliance and many finely arranged magic runes. Both ends of the bow merge toward the center with a straight slope and then are recessed at the hand grip. The bowstring does not seem to be tied up but is integrated with the bow. The whole bow has a slight magical scent but it seems to be quite different from ordinary magical equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
