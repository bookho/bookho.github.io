			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of ​​rescuing Asa was only swayed in the mind of the Sedro period and was completely vetoed before it came out completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s true that if you want to save a person, the Oufu Orc elite is the best candidate, but the person to be saved is not worth saving. People go to adventure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Sedros had to admit that Asa had helped him a lot and was very important, he also liked this young man from his own but There are more emotional reasons that need only be objectively unworthy and can be completely denied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if he saves him, maybe because of this kindness, he can permanently join Oufu, but Asa’s effect on Oufu will not be greater than Gru. . And the danger of organizing to save people’s words is never one-half. All the possibilities of value are converted into various kinds of data. Addition and subtraction have come to a conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm sorry I can't help the kid...and our contract has expired...you ask for more blessings."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sedros sighed for a long time and folded the reports to ignite on the oil lamp. The red-yellow fire slammed into a smog. I don't know why he is a little confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not even intend to inform the group against this news. Although he is also very confident about the rationality of the female prime minister, in order to prevent a woman from being a woman after all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the superiors are not cold and ruthless, they also have feelings. Even because the work usually has a lot of considerations, it is too rational. They even cherish the feelings more than the average person. They only choose the time when they choose not. Their people have become part of their careers and feelings are just a luxury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is a possible choice for Oufu to have a little damage, Sedros will never choose. It is certainly that he devoted all his hard work and spiritual career. But from a certain point of view, Sedros even thinks that Oufu is much more important than his own life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of this city is an unprecedented feat in any way. Perhaps it will be an unprecedented turning point in the history of the Big Six. It is not only the history of mankind but also a larger, broader and more diverse history. Once I think of these Sedros, I can't help but feel excited and no longer excited about the rest of the world. I will jump more vigorously and more vigorously.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the blood is not for his sake. ** is for Oufu. As long as it is for a great cause, he can not hesitate to dedicate everything to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sedros went to the window. Now the stars that are already in the middle of the night are constantly flashing, and the crescent moon is bright and dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are all weak and weak, so they like to hang themselves in some greatness. Eternal things are used to give yourself a great illusion of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden feeling that there would be such a feeling that Sedros smiled a little bit strange. The mind that was already as objective as a hugely complex machine did not know why there was some strange feeling at this time today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of two birds in the distance fluttered and disappeared into the darkness. The eyebrows of Sedros Rose wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild land is not a place where many birds are infested and the two birds seem to be crows that never appear here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it..." Sedros thought about it but shook his head. Turned back to the table and sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eagle eye is a special sorcerer who can be practiced by the sorcerer of the Descartes, and it’s not that any necromancer is willing to spend so much energy and Time is wasted on the spell. Except for Nimbas, it seems that only the magical and timeless geek monsters like Vinina practice such spells, and it is obvious that these two people can no longer use this spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Should not be..." Sedros screamed that he had just reached out to get a document on the table but immediately caught it. Looking at the opposite wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
