			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daylight comes in from a vent in the prison. Xiao Xiao knows that it is time. She sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s already morning." The voice of Clavis came. "It's today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." Xiao Xiao replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while of silence, the voice of Clauvis suddenly sounded again. "Let me see you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small sneaked into the corner and saw the angle of the Clause cell. Through the sun shining through, you can see that a person in the opposite steel fence is sitting there. That person is already too thin to be *humanoid. It is as bright as the sun. The gold that has been dazzling is like a bird's nest. The face that the king has been fascinated by the king is no longer able to find any past. Mark of. If it wasn't for the time being, he would always talk to him and he wouldn't recognize the opposite person who was once the mighty and imposing kingdom of the kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis’s eyes that have been murderous and deterrent at any time are already full of bloodshot eyes but the eyes are surprisingly calm. He looked at Xiao Yan carefully and actually got a smile: "You have been so clean for so long, and your look is like a bride."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Bride?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least it’s more like when I am married." Although Crovey seems to be more than awkward, Eyes and voice are very calm. "Now I think about it. We seem to be husband and wife."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it? Unfortunately, I can’t even think of it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dungeon came out with a neat and powerful step and then the sound of opening the door. A team of heavy swordsmen walked into the dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know. Until now I realized that I actually liked you a little." The voice of Clovis was not deliberately depressed but louder in the swordsmen. The footsteps are weak and unpleasant. "Because I like you a little, I hate you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Xiaoyan thought that he would not be surprised to hear anything, but this sentence made her unexpected. It's even awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsmen opened the fence of Otaru and brought her out. Clavis was sitting on the fence and watching all the strange calm in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Goodbye. Bride. Never say goodbye." When Xiaoyu was taken out of the dungeon, he heard the voice of Clovis in it alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The firearms are located in the central square of Wangdu. On the side of the square, a high-level Duke was temporarily set up to supervise the execution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke carefully revisited the arrangement around the square and nodded. Then he raised his eyes and carefully recalled the setting of each ambush in every street of the king in his mind and then nodded with satisfaction. He determined that no matter what method the person used to sneak into the mix, he would never run as soon as he appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The square is full of guarded kings of the Guards and Magicians of the School of Magic. The Duke has ordered the general public to be near the square to avoid having the target in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church has not yet appointed a new bishop. Now the School of Magic is temporarily hosted by two great priests. The Duke has sent them a magician with little effort and tongue. Plus 10,000 people from the Guardian Army. This is definitely an elite force that can easily capture a city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of person can stand out in such a tight wait? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is a valuable love price. The Duke now likes this sentence very much. He is hoping that the goal is love and that thousands of people are going. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You said that he is hiding in the window of which house is now in a state of confusion. I know that I am coming out to die but I am reluctant to leave." "The Duke smiled and asked Rod Hart behind him." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably," Rodhart replied. Although his posture is still so handsome and straight, it looks so full of temperament but looks a bit funny. Because his eyes are blue, his nose is swollen and his hands are still bandaged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhart flew to the Caloundo Basin with an overnight order. According to the inquisition of the figure, as the Duke had expected, it was verified that the home of this wanted man was in a village in the basin. There is indeed a blacksmith's old father but the father has already died and no other relatives or friends. According to the Duke’s instructions, Rodhart carefully asked the villagers to find the best neighbors who were closest to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the investigation, Rodhart found an old adventurer behind the village ready to arrest her. It is a pity that the old woman is like a little chicken. She just put the leader of the Paladin of the Holy Knights on the ground and asked him what the order was. Several of the officers who went with them had to take out the weapons, but the old woman just moved the officers who had passed through the battlefield and all fell to the ground and called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt is not only smart, but the situation is more clearly analyzed. He did not attempt to resist. He replied that this man and the Necromancer Association colluded with the assassination of Bishop Ronis, so they came here to investigate...when they knew that they had not finished talking, they were broken by the old woman. The old woman only told him coldly that if he had a word nonsense, he would not have the chance to lie again in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you say?" asked the Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't say anything. I just stated what happened to Wang Duo at that time." Rodhart is still calm and dull despite his nose and bruises. . I can imagine that he didn't panic even when he twisted his arm like a dog on the ground. "Then the old woman didn't say anything but just sneered and let me go." His voice was very calm and even politely as if it was indeed a respectable old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke nodded and asked: "Why didn't you go to the local officials to mobilize the army to arrest this person afterwards?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I don't want to die." Rodhart replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other people who went with Rod Hart were carrying them back and the better they were, the more serious they were, the more they were completely disabled. Rodhart is able to stand not because he is the worst, but because he is the smartest and most knowledgeable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke did not care too much about this matter. It’s just a person, even if it’s amazing, it’s not enough to have any impact on the big picture. That Necromancer is a perfect example. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prisoner has been taken to the stake and tied up. She was neatly dressed and white seemed to be a bride. She looked around quietly and indifferently and closed her eyes. I didn’t look at the high platform from beginning to end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers around the squad are silent. Everyone is alerting to attacks that don’t know where they will come from. From the notice of the Duke and the cleverness of such a large array of guards, it can be guessed that this is prepared to deal with the criminal who assassinated the bishop of Ronis. Some soldiers are full of anger and fighting spirit is fear. The battle of the Paladin and the Necromancer a month ago was so fierce that even the listeners were frightened. Only deal with a Necromancer and even the most elite Paladins will lose dozens of people. The ordinary soldiers may be as weak as a caterpillar under the necromancer. Now the squares of these thousands of people do not have the slightest voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have pre-feeled on the roof around the big meal that will appear here. I don’t know when I gathered a lot of crows. They seem to be infected with this somewhat strange atmosphere. Watching the crowd on the square without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timber of the soldiers finally piled up. Just wait for the Duke's adult to ignite immediately. But no one dared to ask the Duke adults. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The square full of people under the broad daylight is so quiet. It’s so quiet and quiet that it’s like a stupid smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of the High Platform stood up and raised his hand for the last time around the square. But looking at the daughter who was calm and watery on the stake, he actually hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the Duke realized that thousands of people’s eyes were gathered in their hands. He took a deep breath and the slender eyes suddenly screamed sharply. The hand waved down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All eyes were transferred to a pastor next to the stake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The torch was slowly handed over to the woodpile, and the priest's hand was shaking. He was concentrating on the whole body or waiting for the big drink and the hidden weapon....<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stop your hand." A scream suddenly came on the occasion of this millennium. The priest dropped the torch with the degree and explosiveness of the warrior and rolled it away. The heartstrings of everyone tightened suddenly exploded. The sound of thousands of long swords at the same time suddenly turned the silent square into a murderous jinma iron horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are no magic bows coming. At the end of the long street, a fast horse rushed over and the man waving a long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The target has already appeared in the ambush around the bow and the hand is all out and the magicians are beginning to recite the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stop." This scream was made by the Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The command of the battle was made by the duke who had already arranged it, and immediately dozens of captains also called the men to stop. But even so, there are several magicians who throw fireballs out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Boom’. Although several fireballs did not directly hit the target, they all exploded next to them, and even the people who took the horses were shaken to the ground. The man seemed to be unharmed and stood up and waved his sword in his hand and rushed over here and shouted: "Sister, don't be afraid that I will save you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Stop all the hands to stop me." The Duke has been thundering on the high platform. Fortunately, those who had heard the order in time did not turn the future emperor into a hedgehog on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cliss waved the weapon in his hand and rushed to the square. The soldiers all heard the command of the Duke, who dared not to start and did not dare to wave around the weapon, actually rushed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sly face of the fire on the column has collapsed and watched his sister burst into tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You go and take the idiot to me and take it back." The Duke ordered Rodriguet to swear. From the arrest of the eldest daughter, she will soon become the emperor’s little daughter. She will cry and make trouble every day and say that she will let the emperor order the pardon or not, and she will not marry the Duke’s headache. So ordered to put her under house arrest. I can't think of her running out of this section. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt jumped off the high platform and ran to the past and grabbed Chris's sword and hugged her back. Chris was still crying and struggling with Rod Hart to stun her on her neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this half-way killer was taken away, not only the Duke sighed, but the tight nerves of the soldiers also slowed down. After such a trouble, the atmosphere of tension has disappeared. The ignited priest climbed up from the ground and was a little embarrassed to pick up the torch on the ground and throw it into the wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no magic in the air. The priest breathed a sigh of relief and looked carefully and saw that nothing was born. Although there was sporadic rain on the sky. But the wood piled up very well and the dry fire burned quickly. The priest turned and retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it took a few steps to get past the pastor. Because it seems that there is a kind of faint grotesque smell. I don’t know where it came from. It seems that there is still a familiar taste. He looked around and saw that the rain that had fallen from the sky was actually a black grotesque smell that was scattered from the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A drop of raindrops fell on the hands of the priest. The priest smashed his hand and the rain was a bit like the mud inside the gutter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up in the sky with a strange look. The sun is shining, there is no cloud, only a big bird hovering above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stinking black rain happened to fall in his mouth. He quickly bowed his head and sipped his tongue to cover the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘呸’. He spit out the spit. But with the spit, there are half of the tongue and a few teeth and even half of the lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor thought it was his own eyes. He reached out and touched his own mouth and didn't feel anything. Then he immediately saw that the two fingers that had just passed the rain had fallen to the ground and were already black as if they had been soaked in ink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This full of smell is as stinking as if I had just eaten a bucket of boiled manure. It seems that there is still something that rushes into the mouth with fullness. He then vomits and sees a small piece of internal organs. Then he didn't know anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The others on the square are beginning to notice this strange rain. Some people still drip into a relatively large shape. The strange raindrops seem to be human fingers and ears. They are all black and soft and smelly like mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a Necromancer!" Finally someone started screaming hysterically. The screaming people are a few priests and magicians. They all participated in the magical school siege of the Necromancer who have seen this black porridge-like liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the effect of this black sap and the death of the Necromancer are still a lot worse, but the scope of this time is big. Almost the entire square was enveloped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a more intense rain. This time someone finally saw where the black dead rain came from. First, two small black spots fell from the back of the bird. When I was close to the ground, I saw that it was two people. Then the two people suddenly exploded and turned into strange. The black rain fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When someone looked up, they were dripped into their eyes and screamed and quickly reached out and grabbed their hands. The loose eyes and the beads fell with their hands. Many people quickly and hurriedly took the hand to wipe the place where it was black and rain, but the force of a large piece of flesh was directly taken down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear of injury caused by this black rain has a greater impact on the soldiers. Looking at the people around me, they wiped their faces and wiped half of their faces. No matter whether they were trained soldiers, they couldn’t stand it. What's more, there are not a few people who have been drunk by the black rain on the square. The scene suddenly became a pot of porridge. Many people have fallen down on the ground and rolled more people. The escaping priests have desperately used the screams and pains of the decontamination of the decontamination and the painful screams. The officers who were completely concealed and able to give orders were not even halfway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bird that fell black rain uttered a sound that rang through the sky and began to dive downward. A few pastors who have been to the front of the West have already screamed: "It is the orc's Wyvern!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Duke of the Duke...Does Oufu and Necromancer Is there a collusion?" A senior officer who had retreated to the shelter of the high platform looked at the Duke of Mulak in horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, they will say that this is the spy of the Necromancer." The light in the eyes of the Duke is flashing. I can't think of this kid actually being able to borrow a Wyvern in the short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the Duke was eager to solve Asa’s biggest reason was Oufu. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Bishop Roones told Cedrus that the evidence of his collusion with Oufu was given to the court’s letter, but Bishop Ronis died and Asa It seems that Cedros, who has a little relationship, will definitely guess that he is doing his own hands and feet. The evidence was handed over to the court, although it was uncertain how fast it would be faster than it was to master the Paladin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single Essar who does not understand the political diplomatic conspiracy or the Duke of evidence on the other hand, Sedros has a way to cope. But if the two are united together, Cedros can't even go to the gods if they try to help Asa wash the charges and let him be a witness. Therefore, the Duke had to sacrifice Asa at all costs, but he had to force Asa to kill it first.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this situation has to kill this kid here. Even if Cedros has the heart to help this kid borrow his two-legged dragon, it should be the limit. A large number of orc warriors cannot come to the king in such a short period of time. If you use a two-legged dragon to carry a few, it will not do anything, and if it fails, it is more dangerous. The Wyvern can be said to be the kid who stole it, but if he sent someone, the collusion of the Necromancer to kill the bishop of Ronis would leave no room for manoeuvre. Don't say that you will be immediately hostile to the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in the current situation, you have to kill this kid anyway. The duke took a deep breath and thundered out: "The archer's magician is ready."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Wyvern just dropped a bit and stayed in a pretty Circling at a high altitude and then dropping a corpse on it. The people below are more flustered and the officers can no longer manage the soldiers. The corpse was in the place where the fire column was dropped. The soldiers began to scatter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The archer magician gave me a shot." The duke's snoring passed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But more than the archers and magicians are the crows that stop on the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crows stood quietly at the beginning and stood there with the atmosphere of dignity and tension. But until the following became a mess, these little things still did not move as much as sculpture. But all people will not care about this. And now almost the same as the duke's snoring, there are nearly a thousand crows all around, and they all flew to the center of the fire column. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You....how did you really come...." Xiao Yan looked at the person who had landed by her from the sky and finally couldn’t make a sound. Her expression is excited, joyful and sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked at her with a smile but did not answer. The crows in his mouth, who were carrying complex and difficult spells, all gathered together, and the two of them were surrounded by a sphere that surrounded them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Boom. A fireball exploded on the crow. The fireball that could have blown people up, but failed to make these crows fly only to blow the outermost pieces into pieces. There are no traces of blood in the debris, all black scented juice and stone-like muscles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hold me." Asa yelled and pulled out the knife behind him and cut off the chain on Xiaoyan. Xiao Yan reached out and grabbed Asa’s waist. The slamming arrows and magical shots on the crows beside them were shots of wood that could not penetrate the little birds. Asa shouted and the two-legged flying dragon that stayed in the air began to flutter and flew away from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officers finally re-directed the soldiers. The people who could move in the entire square shouted and rushed toward the fire. But even when the nearest soldier rushed to the fire column that was already on fire, he could only watch the black ball wrapped in the crow ascending to the sky. Many soldiers threw the spear and the arrow in his hand but still could only Kill some crows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some clever magicians and archers have attacked the rope that tied the two. But after all, it was only a thin rope and the hit rate was really low. And the rope is obviously not generally affected by dozens of bows and arrows and even a fireball shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The archer continues to shoot. The magician shoots the two-legged dragon." The duke's snoring came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the position of the magicians standing is too far for the height of the Wyvern. The low-level magician's fireball and lightning dissipated on the way to reach the height of the Wyvern, and most of them deviated from the target. Only one or two powerful fireballs hit the wings of the Wyvern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two-legged dragon squats and sinks slightly downwards but immediately rises again slowly. The defensive power and life of this swamp behemoth can never be dealt with by a few magics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rainbow-like bows fall on the zombie crows around, and the crows are constantly being blocked by the arrows on their bodies or by too many arrows. Only the weight is carried down. Otaru held Asa in one hand and made a few gestures in the air to say: "The elves in the air please listen to my will to block the attack." A strong whirlwind began to form an archer's attack outside the crow and was weakened. A lot of arrows that are not strong enough are only blown away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asapo looked at Xiao Yan with amazement. This whirlwind Aegis is quite advanced air magic, I can't think of her being able to use it and it is in such an emergency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wyvern's ever-higher magic is no longer possible. Otaru and Asa have risen by 20 meters, although the surrounding crows are still left, but the height and whirlwind Aegis have not been able to shoot them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;小懿 and Asa look at each other. Xiao Yan’s face is still full of tears, but the eyes of both of them are all happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry about the dragons, all the magic is given to me." The voice of the Duke re-emerged and got closer. The two looked down and the Duke was rushing down to them just below the height of his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only six nearby magicians can accurately attack them. Four fireballs and two ice cones flew in three different directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-time fireball is already in the limit for a short period of time and the magic power can no longer be condensed. Asa took a knife and opened a cone of ice in the hand. He directly extended his right foot to pick up. The slamming sound of his right foot suddenly became vague and completely frozen. But this blow was eventually blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this delay they both rose by about ten meters. They can rise to a safe level before the magician gathers the next attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom is close at hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a scream from the Duke. A soldier was arrested by the Duke and threw himself into the sky and shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s own body slammed into the shoulder of another soldier below. The sound of the broken bones sounded from the shoulders of the soldiers and collapsed and screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke has jumped through the shoulders of this soldier to the half-empty hand and raised a long-awaited soldier’s sword. This sword is not against the two-legged dragon or the person but the rope between them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no longer a fluttering bow or a flying sword. Just listen to the wind and you can understand that even if there is an iron chain in the middle, it will be broken under this sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s knife came out of his hand. A long sword thrown by the Duke was immediately smashed by a knife. The knife flew down to the ground with an arc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s taste of kindness in the smile of a chubby smile has long since disappeared. Because he still has a long sword in his hand. He waved the sword with his hand and flew toward the rope with a wind ten times more fierce than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Duke had stepped on the chest and stomach of the soldier he had thrown into the air. The soldier’s chest and abdomen suddenly collapsed and the screams did not bleed and the internal organs spurted from the nose and mouth and fell from the air. It’s just that the height is not too high and has been smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this borrowing, the Duke has once again pulled out and rushed straight into the air. The right hand swung a sharp squeak from his waist and his own slender sword was already in his hand. The sword has been united. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little singer sang a cold ice arrow and screamed at the long sword that screamed at the ropes overhead. However, the white water magic is in the wind and thunder of the flying sword, and it is as strong as a bubble. The long sword casts a detour to the line of destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of Xiao Xiao’s body is already in a desperate color. Heaven and hell are the one line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The straight rope screamed as if the lowest pitch on the strings was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the entire square were watching the battle in midair and saw that the rope was finally broken and screamed under the attack of the Duke. Half is a good applause. Because the rope is broken, only one person is falling down and the other person is rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s eyes never left the long sword that flew. At the moment before the rope was broken, he had already hugged his hands and threw her up. The strength and timing of the use are just right enough to allow her to fly to the broken rope after the sword has passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being thrown, Xiao Xiao has already been convinced. She grabbed the broken rope at both ends and she used her own hand as the connecting rope. Asa’s figure fell only a little and immediately stabilized again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain in the hands of the rally made Xiao Yan snoring. But she knows that as long as she persists in this, the two-legged dragon can fly off the king's range and land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but there is a duke below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the wind from the Duke’s body is actually as sharp as the arrow. His sword has no momentum and exaggerated meaning that he does not want to smash what annihilates what he just wants to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the sharps and effects of the Sword include all the power skills of the Duke are concentrated on the tip of the sword. Even the steel plate can stab it. Wear it. The tip of the sword refers to Asa's eyebrows, even if measured by a ruler, is the most intermediate and deadly eyebrow. The effect of a sword penetrating here and twisting people into seventy or eighty pieces is the same as death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
