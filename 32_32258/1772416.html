			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gravitational field has slowly dissipated but no one of the surrounding skeleton monsters can stand up or say that no one can have a complete body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not just the skeleton monsters. The whole sea of ​​the dead spirit seems to be quiet. There are only bone fragments around the ground, although there are still undead in the distance, but since entering this death ban, everyone has the chance to rest quietly for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strongest ogre, including the most savage, fell to the ground and the entire coalition had already been crazy to the brink of collapse. Although everyone is thinking about moving forward, there is no more pneumatic bomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru's vindictive light dissipated and landed again. This person who alone stirred the sea of ​​the undead out of such a large space did not look at his own record. He stepped on the thick bone fragments and he looked forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just because of his unbeatable attack in this round, the darkness of the air seems to be not so strong, even the strong orcs in the coalition can no longer rely on The priests stood in the white magic. In contrast, the huge darkness in front of the group is as darker, darker, and more concentrated. Asa flew up on the ground and looked like an ant running towards an ancient behemoth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding when this group was originally moving towards the center of the darkness of the whistling valley, it has stopped and quietly stayed there seems to be waiting for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glu stood to bend slowly and bowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had already shot countless arrows before a moment, but this is the first time he has opened this phantom bow with such a formal, solemn and slow posture. It seems that he knew that he would have liked Lancelot to have already returned to the coalition brigade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his motion bow slowly deforming. The ground around him is also sunken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subtleties of the ground did not change, but the entire ground within 100 meters of him began to fall into a strange squeak and small violent screams. It seems that the whole space is not under pressure, but the whole space is sag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in the distance and many people in the coalition can't see the action of Gru, everyone can hear a strange squeak. This is kind. There is something that has reached the limit and is about to burst the sound of the explosion. It’s not just that the sound coming from the air seems to come from everyone’s heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bow is full of strings, but not on the strings. This phantom god archery was originally not an arrow but a shooter's vindictive spirit soul. Now the appearance of the whole bow has been completely different from other times. The bow has not seen the original black. Numerous esoteric esoteric esoteric essays swaying around the bows are not just immersing the bow itself. Even Gru seems to be looming in this run-in rune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;劈劈啪啪. It seems that the exact voice seems to be the auditory hallucination. Everyone feels the feeling of this crack. The sights seen in front of the eyes have begun to break and twist. The power of this bow that has not been fully loaded has already swelled all the surrounding space, including space and feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rune that has emerged from the bow has risen to the point where the palm of the hand is already dazzling and has been flying all over the sky. In such a space that almost collapses, it flows in a strange and special way. The radiance of the rune is not the green of the arrow, but the dazzling white that reveals the greenness of the vagueness. This is the color of Gru's vindictiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black that was originally filled around the rune was flying like a fire under the fire. Even the breath of the Dark Star began to avoid these green ray runes. This time it doesn't seem to be shrinking but it is indeed shrinking in dissipating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost everyone was shocked by the momentum of this bow. Only Lancelot and Roland did not look at it but turned to look behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small shadow of the endless sea of ​​dead is coming here. The direction of the coming is the direction they are coming from or the direction of the Deya Valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon the shadow flew closer to appear as a cyan dragon. This is not a skeleton monster like a dragon, but a real huge green dragon. In the breath of the dark star that can be swallowed up, it does not appear to be uncomfortable with the surrounding black. Instead, it flows into it and even if the fish is in the water, there is no such smoothness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting on this substantial curse, the current lich is not smug. Although she has no expression, she can see that her mood is very wrong no matter where she is. The green and white rune in the distance illuminates her face through such a long distance. The dry muscles on her face, like dry grass, began to dry more like the moss that only survived in the dark and wet, and the raging sun began to shrink and fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames in her eyes seem to have been affected by the flickering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't let him shoot." The hoarse spilt came out of the lich's body. With the screaming, the dark dragon that she sat down opened a huge green flame ball and turned into a slender afterimage to go straight behind Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary flame spit can't be far away and even the streaks of scattered light may not break through. This is to condense all the flames into a little like a fire. General attack. And this is the fierce fire of the Dark Dragon, even if the fire magic of the former fire master Esri is not as good as a fart under this fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this flame afterimage only flies in half and then breaks from the first half and then two halves and then two halves Half of the two halves... until it becomes a shattered flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roland, are you going to hinder me when this git? Do you think you are still my opponent now?" Vadrina screamed again. The net made up of a dense and slashed sword of this flame was taken out from the sword of the head of Roland. Only his slashing sword can crush the fireball that is almost incompetent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the scream of the lich, a green flamingo flies out of her hand and goes straight away, just leaving her hand, the flamingo madly sucks the air The darkness of the air swells and looks almost the same size as the Dark Dragon. The heat waves and the scent of the smoldering and the darkness of the air itself are drowned. But this amazing magic still can't fly far away. A white lightsaber rushes to the sky and slams the flamingo's head from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firebird is just a magical shape and it is not really a life-only bird. But after being attacked by this sword, the shape of the whole firebird immediately collapsed. This Holy Cross sword has defeated the entire structure of this magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the cover of the two strongest swordsmen, Gru finally shot his arrow and the runes that seemed to fly all the time seemed to gather enough momentum and The power gathered all over his hand. With a sound that seemed to tear the world apart, it rushed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the orcs who are still alive have almost done the same action to cover their ears. Even so, they feel that they have been torn apart under this voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is shaking and shaking all the time space as if it has been completely broken by the rune that is full of his vindictiveness and then with the empty rune As a green and long rainbow that dances and pulsates, all the space and time will be crushed together. The sea of ​​the dead spirit is shaking in this arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light rushed to the darkest black before Asa. The darkness split. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was originally black and couldn’t see anything. It seemed that the blackness of the chaos was broken in this dazzling green light. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Asa, who had already ran to the dark edge, jumped into the darkness of this rupture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not just the darkest black. The whole sea of ​​the dead spirit has been shrouded in the sky. The black is also cracked like a black crystal cover. The sun that broke through the cracks for a long time was revealed from the cracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless undeads that are coming here suddenly stopped moving like a puppet suddenly cut off the line and there are still a lot of things that suddenly fall down in the same place. . This arrow is really shooting the entire undead sea. The dead air of the rolling cycle has stagnated and cracked together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is only a moment of rupture. The blackest black in the next moment and the black air in the sky were combined. Asa’s body image was swallowed up and drowned in the darkness and there was no sound. The darkness in the air has faded a lot. After all, this is the deadly atmosphere of the Dark Star for thousands of years. It is impossible for a person to be strong enough to completely break it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru did not care about these things because he should have done it and turned to look at the dark dragon that flew down here. Under the huge summoning dragon, his body is too small. His hands are empty, and the phantom god bow has disappeared. This arrow shot not only the arrow and the bow were all turned into the sky full of runes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
