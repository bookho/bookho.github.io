			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are hundreds of scarred beasts in the center of the square gathered together around the thousands of swordsmen pastors and magicians who are already surrounded . It is no longer a difficult thing for Oufu’s strongest point to not annihilate the remaining orcs. But no one dares to move because the most critical point of the whole situation has been pinched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What I want is the life of all the orcs here except myself and this girl. Of course, this world tree leaf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to save these orcs?" Lancelot glanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The kid can't live so much. I have the most value for both of you." Adela snorted. "We have achieved victory now. These orcs are already Oufu's elite. If they are prepared to go back to raise their injuries, it means that the continuation of this war will also have the lives of tens of thousands of soldiers." I will never agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled a bit: "Oh, great, it’s the Pope’s sire. For the so-called big picture, you can even have your own life. No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no. I think I can gamble now. With the tens of thousands of warriors’ lives, Celeste’s victory is a bet. I am willing. I bet you don't dare to kill me. Even if I am really dead, it is not worthwhile compared to the tens of thousands of soldiers who will die on the wild land." Adela said lightly. His face is still a beautiful woman-like face. The temperament that is now displayed is completely different from the softness of the past. It is the spirit of the true leader who has a vision that overlooks the world. "You kid. You would rather use the lives of tens of thousands of compatriots in exchange for what you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not so great, I just want to be me." I think it's the right thing," Asa said lightly. He didn't have the temperament of Adela's body and the tone and vision that overlooked the world, but he was still calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You... Do you think that you are more important than the lives of tens of thousands of people?" Talis looked angry at Asa. It’s just that no matter how hard she works, her expression and tone can’t bring out the true pure kind of warrior’s anger. On the contrary, it is more a strange helplessness and sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know. I don't know how to measure these. Maybe there is no way to measure the reasons why you have you. I also have my reasons. I only know that I want to do this. Just do it." Asa faintly looked at Talis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adela and Lancelot glanced at each other with a stunned look and then sighed secretly. The purpose of the previous words is to make Asa feel guilty and the Pope is very clear about Asa’s nature. He will never be the kind of person who can ignore the means of human life. As long as his mind is impetuous and contradictory for the words just now, once there is a flaw, Lanster will immediately shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he did not disdain and counterattack and did not defend his actions. He no longer has to look for standards to measure his direction like a storm. There is no flaw in itself without any support. The most important factor of belief is not whether it is in line with the standard and whether it can be true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't think it's worth it, as long as Lancelot thinks it's worth it." Asa looked at Lancelot. "How? I know you will think so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot sighed long and said: "Oh, forget it. Even put it." These hundreds of orcs don't matter. Gru has already died in Cedrus, and it is hard to stand alone... Glorious Castle also needs you thousands of believers on this big 6 and a pope who can really think for them. I don't want to go Adventure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say?" Asa stunned, but this time his face fluctuated. "Isn't Cedrus not assassinated by you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This surprise is not a big flaw but it is also a flaw. For the sake of reason, Lancelot is enough. But he did not shoot. Because he and the pope are more surprised than Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Is Sedros dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just three people look at each other The great gods around and Talis are also full of surprises. Although they have already planned to imagine the old man who captured this hostile force to capture the assassination and burn it on the stake. But at this time, the news was so shocked that even the joy that should have been felt could not be felt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
