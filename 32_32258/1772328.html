			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazingly, Asa was shocked and looked up. This time in his eyes The light is not as hesitant as it was just now, but the brilliance of the fire, while one hand touched his waist.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waist, originally been there The small pocket is gone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hole, the figure in the last Lancelot is flashing, but he does not have the hand holding the sword. A small pocket.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hilt pocket with the dark star.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stand up." Asa screamed, bowed, and the arrow generally rose from the ground and rushed straight to the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when he just jumped to the cave and couldn’t stand, he saw a sword. Lancelot, who should have entered the passage, suddenly turned back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Things left." Asa drank and got out. This time the knife is no longer hesitant just like that. The black knife brought out a trajectory such as a dark black ink ribbon, and the air in the passage seemed to be black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot did not speak, and the current pocket is on his lips. He bit the rope of the bag with his teeth, although his right hand is now distorted, but the sword stabbed in his left hand is still a dignified sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the knife and sword intersecting this time is now as light as a broken wind but as heavy as a landslide. Huge roar and half-flushing shook the narrow passage. Asa fell directly and a large number of stones in the passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current situation of vindictiveness and strength seems to be still the upper hand, but he has not yet stood still, and Lancelot also saw this. So he only got back from the earthquake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While he was chasing and chasing, he also used the command of the mind, and the two Necromancers also moved. It’s just that they didn’t move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika is still such a stoop. Take off. The tremendous power still made him squat like a huge mutant muscle. But just as he was off the ground, the waist was originally shattered by the broken spine under the sword of Lancelot. The disorder of the upper and lower body movements made him lose his control. The huge body flew obliquely and slammed into the rock wall and made a loud noise. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodgout seems to be worse. When he was in the body of fire, the high temperature carbonized a small part of his body. Although the muscles in the damaged area are slowly recovering, the speed is very slow. His movements were like a puppet operated by a lame teacher. He climbed up to the rock wall. This movement is obviously impossible to have any effect. It has fallen off the rock wall several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stood up again. All the remaining vindictiveness gathered and rushed to the cave. But when he barely stood at the mouth of the cave and was clearly clearing the fallen rocks, he felt a raging magical power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the magic power of the water system. Even if it is a half-gas resistant magical ice, it will only be frozen by the surrounding cold. Asa only retreated and jumped back to the ground. When he looked up again, the cave mouth had finished solidifying into a thin white ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ice can be broken, but it doesn't take much effort, but this effort should be enough for the Knights of the Shrine to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Globe." Huge anger rushed into my heart. What is bigger is disappointment and confusion. Asa gritted angrily and looked at the white layer of ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind Asa, the Black Dragon has slowly supported the upper body, and the horrible scar on his shoulder has basically healed under the effect of healing magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her huge pair of yellow dragons looked at Asa’s back with strange eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the passage at the top of the cave, Lancelot stood next to the local Sylvia, who had just listened to Lancelot’s command to put all the magic power Condensed into an ice barrier and distributed. Although the release of the curse reel before this time, his magical power was almost exhausted. But as a magician in the Knights of the Temple,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot held the pocket in his hand and had a strange glow in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was staggered with Asa, he felt that something hanging around Asa’s waist was a bit weird. Although it is very thin, but the exhalation of the atmosphere can make him feel like a top warrior with a deep sense of disgust and fear from the soul. So almost from instinct, he took the small pocket off. Judging from the fact that Asa was later desperate to chase and retrieve, he probably guessed what it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if it’s not that Sylvia is able to come, he may not be able to resist the pursuit of Asa, but it should be to perform another The important task of Sylvia has appeared in this original secret channel, even Lancelot has some unbelievable feelings, while the other two, it is even more unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talis, why are you here too?" The paladin looked at his female apprentice and frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis's face was pale under the weak light, and there was no strange voice to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't catch up, I may feel that they have left the scope of the space lock, and feel that each of them has a transfer reel "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dull and awkward voice came, Asa turned to look at Moriel, who was barely able to look up. The black dragon's huge yellow eyes looked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The guardian of the dark will, come over, I have something to say to you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked at the face of the frozen rock wall and sighed indignantly, turned and walked to the front of Moriel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the hilt must be recovered, it seems that it must be a rather long-term and complicated process. Before that, Morrison’s business here must be handled well, at least Asa is not sure what is happening here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you are the dark guardian of this generation. First of all, I want to thank you, this is the first human that Molier has thanked for thousands of years. I can assure you that my gratitude will definitely surprise you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Dragon's voice echoes in the cave, it feels very strange, just like it is covered The iron iron of the silk, although it sounds friendly, but one of the top-down hard majesty cannot be concealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I don't need any thanks from you..." Asa shook her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh. I understand what you are thinking, human." The black dragon does not seem to be unexpected, and the heavy voice echoes in the space of the cave, appearing thicker. "I can see that you are strong. And as the guardian of the dark will of this generation, there are not many things that can make you interested in this continent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This name in the mouth of Moriel is obviously aimed at the Necromancer. Asa opened his mouth to defend or explain, but after all, there was no opening. This passage is only accessible to the acting president of the Necromancer Association. The two Necromancers around you are almost a symbol of identity. But if you want to explain them one by one, it is really troublesome, and although it is not pleasing to the ear, Morrie's tone has a strange charm, and people can't help but want to listen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mollyton paused and continued: "But I know that you are interested in the mystery of the Dark Star. Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nodded, which is not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But before that, you must be a favor for me..." Morrill continued, her voice gradually went down. "After more than a decade ago, people who helped the church attacked Nigan. I didn't care about it at first, but they actually attacked the station of the Black Elves. No one can resist. The I have to disappear. They, but just after I left the lair, I felt that my body was extremely weak. When I returned, I discovered that the most important part of the seal that Akibad gave me, the blood bottle of the dragon. I don't know who was stolen..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
