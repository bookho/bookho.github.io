			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people like to drink when they are happy. Because once the numbness of other trivial emotions and reason are not there, only happy, then you will feel more happy and happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt is very happy now. At first glance, he doesn't seem to drink a glass of wine. He starts to redden his eyes and some sloppily reveals some drunkenness. But then no matter how you drink, he only keeps the feeling of drunkenness and will not continue to drunk. I have been stuck in a state of intoxication, and I am not losing but I can let my emotions out. This is undoubtedly a very popular and extremely useful talent on the wine table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than a month ago, he escorted Chris back to the Duke’s Duke and he touched it and immediately saw it in a very professional and authentic way. It is a rare talent that can be made. It is rare to know that talents are rare and talented people can die. A young man with good qualifications and no family background and no political position. This kind of talents cultivated based on emotions is the confidant that can really be entrusted with heavy responsibility. So the Duke let him stay and also signed up for his upcoming competition for the Paladin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to say that I have any gratitude and respect, there are only two people. First, my grandfather, who died, is you. If you don't have me, If you die long ago, there will never be such an opportunity. I can grow up because of your influence. You are not just my respected and grateful person or my friend and friend. I actually have a friend like you. It’s my blessing.” Rod Hart’s handsome blush said his heart through the wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people like to drink when they are sad. They feel that they are numb and they don’t know anything. However, such people are generally very difficult to get drunk because they are always distracted to think about how they are still not drunk, but they are always drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is like this now. The head began to faint and the feeling of the limbs has begun to numb, but the thinking seems to be more and more clear and even divided into four points of sadness, two points of trouble, two points of anger and remorse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell the truth, he didn’t think much about the attitude of this friend and the other person who regarded himself as an idol and always put it in his heart. This distraction seems to be aggravating and weakening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt asked in an almost eager tone whether he planned to settle down in the kingdom and whether he would share a world with him. The ambition that he had already been extinguished by the cruel reality was violently burned again because of the opportunity given by this heaven to open up the new world. "Do you see that there is no need for power in this world? What can't be solved by power? I used to think that the noble things of justice and love can be above them. But even if these things are true, they are implemented. It also needs strength." He looked at the eyes of Asa's half drunk and was full of respect. "This is the reason you made me understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa drunk a glass of ale like a white water drunk and watched him shake his head and said: "You get Wrong. I only know that when I am hungry, I will sleep and sleep. I will do what I want to do. Where can I understand this profound truth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No It is you who let me understand the importance of strength." The half-drunk young knight is very certain that he is his own idol. "And after I got here, I finally realized that the most important force in this society is that status is power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His thoughts have at least improved Half is the credit of the Duke of Mulak. Dealing with this young Duke, who is full of leaks, is a sacred hand. A small, sloppy little language that doesn't reveal the traces can make them use the various fighting spirits that the Duke needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's do it together. As long as we both work together in this world"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not interested "Asa finally felt a little faint and satisfied." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are too clear." Rodhart shook his head and sighed. Even this rejection of him was considered a morally noble performance. "Be aware that the world is like a kitchen and then a fine food. You must also be greasy and dirty." Do you not stand tall and stand on the high ground to look down on those mundane idiots, but are willing to let those who are born Is the bastard standing on your head doing whatever you want in the world?” Rodhart’s ruddy complexion energized alcohol to the depths of his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clys suddenly appeared at the door of the pub. She slammed in and slammed into Rod Hart’s head and yelled: I dare to drink here during the day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This smile made Asa feel that this friend is much more pleasing to the eye. Even if he wants to pursue power again, he is still a simple and lovely young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clys squinted at her beautiful single phoenix eyes and looked at Asa very carefully as if it were the most eccentric animal in the world. Then she suddenly clap her hands: "It turned out to be you. I said how it looks so familiar. I didn't even know how to change the clothes like this."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out that she recognized Asa at this time. Probably in the eyes of women, men's dressing is usually more worthy of distinguishing than the five senses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bluntly sat down next to Rodhart and picked up the glass and sipped the wine out of it. She first expressed her warm concern about Asa’s new clothes and her intentions to go to the Duke’s House. She put her face close to her eyes and looked at the excitement of the excitement. Q: "Hey, what did you and my sister do these days? I It seems strange to see her"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just to travel together and help the bishop to do something." Asa feels that these two drinkers are not ideal. . Which pot does not open, the more they have to go to mention which pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cliss seems to have made up his mind to mention the bottom. "Don't yell at me, I can see how this is going on. I have known my sister for 18 years and have never seen her as weird as it is today. She used to run away among the large group of plagues like nothing. Carrying the body. Even if Dad told her that she had already engaged her, I couldn’t move the look on her face. The calm sister saw that you were shaking and shook a bit yesterday. After you left, she also lost her soul. The same," she sighed and smiled to reveal two very intoxicating dimples. "This is really like the story above the book. Miss aristocrats and a poor young man are privately for life, but she has to marry other people because of the life of their parents or other messy things. This is really a fateful trick." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that you are bothering this." Rod Hart suddenly realized. After the two met, Asa had been silently being dragged into the pub by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is not trying to hide. In fact, he is also eager to find someone to pour out the sadness and sadness of his heart and let his friends share it. But the story of him and Xiaoyan is mixed with secrets such as the Duke’s plan of the world tree leaf and the dead spirit. The less the guild and so on, the less people know the better. In particular, Rodhart’s relationship with the Duke is now very subtle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt silently and unintentionally looked at the next Klis. She is also the daughter of the Duke. He sighed and took a shot of Asa’s shoulder and said, "Let’s take a look. The husband is still good at career. The feelings are good but the stubbornness is not necessary. It’s the result of being fortunate. Let go when you let go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed. A lot of things in the world can be said to be put down and put down. The more beautiful things, the more reluctant they are, the more painful they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of shit do you put? They are not emotionally broken." Criss patted Rodhart again. She turned to look at Asa. "I am specifically chasing you out. Because I have to ask you a question: Do you really like my sister?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa squinted The cup raised the empty cup and took a sip. I didn’t realize that I didn’t actually import anything. Vaguely said: "How can you like it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you like it, it’s good. This is the two people can The most important reason together. I am sure that my sister also likes you very much." She seems to have finally solved one of the most important problems and changed her tone. "As for the little difficulty in front of you, it is just a small outside and it can be said that it is the tempering that you must experience. You can rest assured that it is artificial."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Man-made?" Both Asa and Rod Hart were stunned. They really don't understand how this can be done by ‘for’ external factors. If you have to say ‘a little’, then it’s hard to find a bigger ‘point’ in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where do you live now?" asked Chris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The big house on the edge of the west of the city. It is the place where the Academy of Magic used to store the body." Asa replied slyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are going to pack up and wait there. I will let my sister come to you in the middle of the night." Chris’s voice is light but every A word violently swayed Asa's nerves. "You run away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhart looked at the daring proponent and said carefully and solemnly: "Cris is not a joke. Do you know how important your sister's wedding is?" Of course, it doesn't really know what is hidden behind this marriage, but even the political marriage of the Duke and the Elni family is huge enough to allow all the children to stand on their side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The more important is just someone else's business, not my sister. I only have this one sister, I hope she will be happy for a lifetime. For a woman and beloved The happiness of people together is the most important. Women never need to be sad and strong, as long as they are warm and gentle, and they are happy together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" But this thing is really "Rodhardt's scratching his head is really unacceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clys glared at him and said with the most disgusting expression and tone: "I seriously warned you. If you dare to take this thing Leak to my dad to know what you think I am dealing with you"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good" Rodehart quickly nodded. "I will be honestly"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you already talked to your sister?" Asa’s voice was a little shaken. "Is your sister calling you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. She still doesn't know. I came to see you. I told her after I went back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She won't agree. You don't know that since she chose to come back, she chose responsibility and commitment to others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She will agree. You don't know that she probably doesn't even know her. In fact, she is far from being as strong and sensible as she thought. I just understood when I saw her expression. So I will come to you." Chris smiled. "You go back and wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa quickly returned to the big house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You bastard is coming back just to help." Sandro is busy dividing and loading the body organs. It seems that the school of magic seems to be experimenting again. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa Woods walked over to help Sandrue play with the body. His heart is very messy and annoying now. Even more annoying than when it came out of the ducal palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he was desperate to give up. Even the perfect rhetoric is ready for yourself in the heart: Isn't it the situation that I have always been yearning for? Isn't that the same thing that I have been trying to achieve when I am tortured by guilty? I no longer have to be chased for that secret, and I don’t have to swear for her injury. I also helped Sandro get back all the things that have solved my freedom. Now I am back to the starting point that I just ran out of Karendo. The dream of free travel is about to start. This is my own life. This is what really is my own. And the Duke wants to implement what kind of plan she wants to get married. It is already already doomed to establish these things. It is useless whether it is what you want to do. This is not your own life. Now I have retired from the disputes that I accidentally dabbled in and returned to the starting point of my life. Isn’t this a good result?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but now there is I hope that the feelings of the original silence will suddenly boil up and it will be difficult to resolve the fierce collision of the abandonment. The most painful thing is that he can only wait here for the unknowable result. He will be excited in the beautiful light of hope and be caught in the fear of disappointment. For the first time, he felt like he was going crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Show me the hand." Shandrew handed a saw. Asa took the saw and continued to turn the river down and hold the wrist and saw it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪. Sander slaps his eyes and shoots Venus. The old man screamed and yelled: "Fuck you this bastard is crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? Oh. Sorry." Asa is now pressing himself. Sandro’s hand is on the saw. Fortunately, he took his hand quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thinking about women?" Shandrew frowned at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Asa nodded. He has no meaning of concealing this old man as long as he asks himself what he can say. Of course, Sandro has no interest in listening to his story and is not a good object to talk about feelings and troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked up and thought about sighing. "Yeah. It will come naturally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Mulak felt tired at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very rare thing for him. He used to have an amazing record of three days and three nights of continuous work. Even the current physical strength and energy of the middle-aged man is that there is still no slight decline in morale and ambition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he feels tired now because his ups and downs of today’s feelings are a bit too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today his failure to persuade the sincerity made him a little frustrated. This is completely different from the kind of 'true heart' that he can always show at any time. He has not shown his true feelings for decades. No matter what people are before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason is the daughter’s upcoming wedding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is part of his great plan. Successful operation. At this point, he is very happy with his sense of accomplishment. But at the same time it was also the death penalty of his daughter's happiness. He can feel that his daughter is heart-cutting when she sees the young man. It is never too good for a father to personally implement this death penalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows the groom's character temper better than him. That will definitely not be a good husband. He doesn't even think of it as a marriage at all, but as a purely acting ritual. The Duke even dared that he wouldn't even touch his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what. Things can only be the case today. The duke sighed and prepared to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A next man suddenly rushed in and reported: "Duke of the Duke. Not good. Miss II has an accident. She has caused injuries in the casino and has already injured people. It was surrounded by people in the casino."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a dead girl." The Duke got up indignantly. Behind the casinos of Wangdu, there are many big-name patrons or royal relatives. Although it should not be a problem, I still have to go there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke did not take long after leaving the government. A figure walked across the wall and quietly went to the west of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small undressed hat is still wearing a low-pressure hat. As long as it is not purposely to see, no one will recognize that she is the soon to marry the Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is walking fast in the street. The heartbeat is also very fast. She did not expect that she would be moved by the sister she had been teaching. It was originally thought that the decision that had been firm and firm with a lot of determination seemed to fall apart without any effort. I was so confused that I accepted my sister’s plan and I really escaped. A firm sense of reason will generally not be an emotional opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can guarantee that this is the most ridiculous and daring decision she has made in her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is also the happiest decision. Gradually getting out of the bustling center of the street is getting darker and darker. But every time I take a step toward the dark west, she will feel that the world is lovely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that we are the same way." An old voice suddenly sounded in the darkness not far from him. "But I can't expect a bride to accompany me to the night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small stunned. Jumped wildly. She didn't realize that someone even thought that the other person could recognize herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be afraid. Maybe we still go to the same person." The person's hand lit up a soft light to illuminate his figure. This is an old man who is dressed in a black robe. Even if he smiles like this, his face is so majestic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop Rooney." Xiao Yan was more surprised than when he was. The sect of the bishop of the monk actually dressed in a black robe and walked quietly like her. This kind of thing is told to others that no one will believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Ronis smiled and shook his head and said: "Since we met here, it would be better not to go. I just have something to say to you. Let me come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
