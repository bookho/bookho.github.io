			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night wind blows Talis's length. Even under this light and fuzzy moonlight, you can see a soft golden yellow. The side of the light shone her originally contoured face like a sculpture that can express the soft beauty with distinct lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember now that you seem to be a woman." Asa has been confused. The wind is blowing towards this side to smell the smell from her side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa slowly straightens towards Talis . Talis was a bit strange but didn't give up or block. She could see that his head seemed to be looking into his ear as if to say something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn’t say anything, just took the nose deep into her ear and took a deep breath and kissed gently on her back. A bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis leaped like a leopard who had been stabbed. She grabbed her ears and her eyes and looked at the unprecedented bluntness of Asa. She seemed to see the strangest changes in the world's strangest monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her face was first smashed and then the blood of the squatting was re-infused back thousands of times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really a woman." Asa licked his lips and smiled. The breath just inhaled permeates the feeling in the chest. There are still two people's faces on the cheeks. The touch is delicate and soft and warm...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this delicate softness and warmth immediately becomes a knife and axe The burning pain. ‘啪’... Talis’s slap in the face was almost spread throughout the School of Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the female knight is not comparable to an ordinary woman or even an ordinary man. If it is not because of pure venting and excitement, I am not afraid to use it. The head will be thrown off. Even so, his half of his face immediately swollen and two nosebleeds rolled out of his nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahahaha..." Asa laughed. Even if he felt that his cheekbones might be cracked, the blood vessels on the half of his face all exploded. The ear was stunned like a smashed gun, but he couldn't help but laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha...cough...haha...cough..." Asa smiled and coughed. Talis madly kicked her foot on the abdomen of his chest, but fortunately she was not wearing the usual stainless steel knight boots. Asa did not resist at all, but only kept her head and face and fell on the roof and kept laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even he himself does not know why he laughs. He just wants to laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After playing a mess, Talis looked at Asa, who was still coughing and cried, and gasped and ran away. The messy footsteps rushed all the way. Also came all the way to break the sound of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the footsteps ran out of the gates of the School of Magic, Asa slowly stopped coughing and laughing. But he is still laughing and laughing. He has almost no harm in his body. Especially if the face is almost swollen and deformed, the slap in the face is definitely a dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, these are still small injuries and have been basically flat under his healing magic. He rubbed his nose and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it’s been beaten, the wine is actually sober. In addition to feeling the ease of a slap in the face, there are some inexplicable helplessness. I would have done it for such a sentence. It might be drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s really fun and easy. Looking back, I feel that it is really funny now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps are approaching. When Asa first noticed that she thought it was a horsewoman to return, but he was not. This footstep he was very familiar with was very familiar long ago, but suddenly he could not think of it. This is deeply imprinted on the deepest part of memory as if you were subconsciously not wanting to touch it, especially this training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not look back until the footsteps had come to him and he only remembered who it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know. Forgot. It seems like it just..." Asa turned her head and looked at her and then stunned. She wore a costume of an adventurer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, you have changed." She said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh. Who can stay the same." Asa smiled slightly and he recognized her dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, who can stay the same? Everything is changing..." She also sighed and asked Asa to look up at the starry sky above. This was the first time she had touched him in the swamp and even had a thin sword at her waist. This is also the dress of the two when they travel together in Europe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you want to change, you are feeling that you have changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no more talk. They all looked at the stars all over the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starlight in the sky is still the same. No matter how many years, it will not change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going tomorrow." I don't know how long Asa said first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where? How long? What?" she asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know." Asa sighed and answered honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Asa no longer talking to Asa and did not open the two to re-silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This silence did not last long. The two men approached each other and kissed. Kissing each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them both gripped very tightly and strongly kissed the hands of the two people and rubbed each other on the other's body. Slowly both of them breathe and become heavy. Asa stood up and hugged her from the top of the cathedral. At the same time, the two men used the feathers to slowly drift away from the night outside the School of Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time in the School of Magic, there are already some priests who have been woken up by the laughter and noises, and they are looking at the torches or the lights everywhere. No one is now slowly sliding from a high altitude to a distant place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one person saw it. She stood in the shadow of the entrance to the School of Magic and stared blankly at the top of the cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men flew out like two birds flying together. She touched her ears and cheeks nervously and then licked the palm of her hand. After she ran out, she felt that her slap in the face was so painful that her hands were so painful that she rushed back to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you want to deliberately keep your efforts and embrace the warmth, it is just feeling the coldness of the parting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two members of the body are fully entangled together and rubbing and squeezing and twisting and entanglement, and wanting to twist themselves together with each other and flesh and blood into one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No thinking, no idea, no language, no reason. At this time, only the most instinct and purest things of people are entangled with each other, and they breathe and resonate with each other and scream at each other. Born to each other. Die each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only at this time can the soul temporarily forget all the sorrow and helplessness because of the fusion of resonance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forget the loneliness that could not be forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I felt that I was feeling lonely, I felt cold. This short collision spark and warmth will be invaluable. No substitute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This life is unforgettable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the noon of the next day, the two talents were slightly separated from each other by entanglement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After gazing at each other, a Mencius Asa held her and kissed her deeply and said, "I love you. Do you know?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well. I know I always know." She nodded softly. "I love you too, do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
