			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a faint silhouette of Gru’s rushing figure, which is no longer the kind of grandeur and arrogance that he used to have when he was single-handed. In the face of the magic released by the priests, he still hasn’t escaped, but he’s not rushing to break the body of his rushing body and then add these magics before touching him. It will automatically disintegrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great priest did not have magic but pulled a long sword from his waist and rushed up to his voice, hoarse and brutal as a beast in desperation. Gru Lian did not pay attention to him. He just took a little from his side and swept past this big priest. Like a broken paper doll, he was caught in the wind and flew out. He was still in the air and his sword in his hand. It has been broken into dozens of pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it seems that there is no previous arrogance, Gru is indeed stronger and stronger than the concept of ‘people’. From his body, he could not feel murderous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge white light sword is coming from the air near the blade and is constantly crushing and bursting. All the swordsmen who saw this sword all stayed. No matter how long the sword has been used for practicing swords for a long time, it seems that this life is the first time to realize what a sword is. This sword seems to be able to open even the shining castles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paladin condenses the full force of the Holy Light Cross, which is tens of meters long and even the same as the giant sword that once held in the hands of the Archangel. All are similar. Under this huge weapon, the vindictiveness and momentum still rushed straight to the vague figure in the center of the lightsaber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a loud bang in the white light sword. The white lightsaber is not a physical but absolutely far less indestructible than any physical weapon. It can even be said that even if it is a curse, it is impossible to have a sword that is mixed with magical martial arts. But now that the lightsaber is broken, Gru has finally stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot also refers to the sword, which is the core of the Holy Cross. The finger has pierced the palm of Grudy. Blood is slowly dripping down his arm. This sword can finally hurt him. ,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s just hurt and it’s not a serious injury. Lancelot's own body is full of blood. The power of this sword has already surpassed his body's load. Sword gas first hurts himself in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru’s other hand has been placed on Lancelot’s shoulder under this hand. No matter what the body is, it is almost the same as mud. But this hand just helped Lancelot not let him fall. The blood is constantly seeping out from the pores of his body. This sword did not hurt the enemy. The injury was originally not the perfect body and strength, but it forced the power of twelve points. This time, the sword is really broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot’s face is also full of blood. This is all the fortitude and firmness of the face, unstoppable and completely covered by the tired 6 The paladin of the strongest warrior is now almost fainted by force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just physical distraction. There is also spiritual. Only he himself realized that the sword that poured all power and life only achieved what it meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru looked at his injured hand and then looked at Lancelot. His eyes are very strange. There is no joy of victory at this time. Even the fighting spirit is not seen but a deep downfall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where do you call me to find an opponent from now on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grou gently put The paladin who opened the Lancelot force was sitting down. Then he turned to look at Adela. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talith next to him suddenly screamed and rushed toward Gru. Before she was completely deprived of the momentum of Lancelot and Gru, she did not act. It was not until this time that there was a reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gruen didn’t even look at her and waited for her to rush. And the result of this kind of earth-rushing is actually even clear to herself. Her shouting, like the priest, did not have the slightest fighting spirit and momentum. It was like a lamb facing the tiger. It’s no longer a demonstration. It’s the hysterical unconsciousness of dying. It’s just instinctively struggling because of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she did not rush to Gru’s side. A figure next to it rushed straight up and knocked him off. She was completely subdued by twisting her wrist over her face. Crazy and desperately earned two times, Talis suddenly sighed and then completely softened and looked at her asa, saying, "You killed me."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed and let her go. Just looking at the sound and the eyes, he knew that she was powerless to do anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the swordsmen around the square just rushed here as the dream woke up. Even the orcs who are close at hand are ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone doesn't move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loud voice. This voice is not very powerful, but it contains a kind of majesty. It is not a deterrent that any person can deliberately imitate. Only the real leader can have a deterrent to the rest of the people. Even under such circumstances, the swordsmen can stand subconsciously. The footsteps. Then they immediately awake to understand that this time rushed up without any effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Adela. He did not escape or attack him indiscriminately. He was the only one of all who could not be completely discouraged by his momentum after seeing Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru also raised his hand and all the orcs stopped. He didn't even have to open the consciousness of all the orcs, but he was completely controlled by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell are you?" Adela looked at Grum and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you? This is not your body." Gru also looked at Adela. His dark scorpion is no longer a black deep pool that can swallow everything but a calm sea. There is no limit to the brilliance of the waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am the current Pope Gevin Magnus." Adela answered. It doesn't make sense for him to hide any cover up against such an opponent. "The first thing I want to tell you is that the death of Cedros is not at all the Glory Castle. It is the hand of Ai Grenair. If you want to avenge Cedros, please go to her. The kid there knows. Her whereabouts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Gru looked at Asa. However, the color of surprise in his eyes flashed past and there was nothing too big to react to Adela. "But these are the future things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand. I will go with you to ensure that these orcs can safely return to the wilderness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not only these...I want the ring in your hand." Gru pointed to the ring of the king in Adela's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adela hesitated. Answer: "This is the treasure passed down by His Majesty the Pope and... This thing has consumed up the power and has not threatened any of you. You should see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"I know. I can see. But I still want." Gru faintly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I understand." Adela took a sigh and removed the ring of the king from his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs and humans around the Great Hall Square have thousands of additions but none of these thousands of people now dare to move. Everyone is convinced by the momentum of that person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And..." Gru put his eyes on the bright hall behind Adela. His eyes suddenly sharpened as if he saw something inside through the outer wall of the hall. “What's there in there?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adela: “Where...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Gru’s eyes haven’t recovered since he’s been thrown there, but his eyes are getting brighter, but some faint brows are wrinkled together. It seems that while looking at the side, thinking about memories, what you want to grab from the depths of your mind. Fuzzy things. Then he suddenly turned his body and looked at the other place. This time his eyes were pure sharp and sharp and violent as two swords that melted into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who?" Azola also responded at the same time and looked at the direction Gru looked at. Not only did they both watched Asalanslot at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of a group of swordsmen and priests closest to here is waving a gesture of whispering ambiguous words. Although everyone in the Guangming Hall is watching him, but he can't see who he is. Although he is facing the Guangming Hall, many swordsmen and pastors in front of the square seem to be facing the swordsmen. In general speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
