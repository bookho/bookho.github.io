			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru’s face looked blue and looked at the lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I advised you to be killed and face to face." Because Hamm smiled and shook his head and raised his hand, the wine in the pot of the head poured down and he sipped his mouth. The drink of the rest of the wine was drenched and the wine splashed out of the face and clothes. The empty jug, which was thrown empty, smashed on the rock and shattered, and the cracking sound echoed a strange shackle in the valley that had been filled with death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got to the front of Vidnina, I still had a strong sense of wine because Hamm didn’t return to Sandru and said, “In any case, I have already said that I can't leave you alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He can't go." Verdina gently waved the dry and ugly hand. The black scent of the entire valley boils like a boiled porridge. This breath contains endless killing and death. "Teacher, this is not what I meant. This is the sacred will of the Dark Star. You should be able to feel it. You don't have to do those useless things. Just stay here with us and wait quietly for this to belong to our Necromancer. Great moment..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if I finally figured it out or realized that there was no room for any turn. Sandru suddenly turned and ran in the original direction. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Disappointing to think that you are too disappointed with the teacher because of the same." The lich looked at the back of Sandro’s escape and shook his head and sighed. The fire of the soul in her eyes burned with the magical flames on her hands. "One or two of them let me down. The man is really just a fake animal. Whatever the usual words, it is also a selfish and weak guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No, it's just that you think the man is too good. People are just a single animal." Because Hamm smiled and waved his face, he was still smiling at the girl. "The idea is just that women who want to rely on men can't get rid of the blame. I said a long time ago that a woman who wants to rely on a man is still a good wife and a good mother. If not honestly ask Too high to want to rely on men emotionally, the final result must be impossible to deal with harm. These words I said 20 years ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" I said it twenty years ago. Don't let me buy the winds theory in front of me that makes me sick." Vide Nina has been watching the back of Sandro, who is still running. "And still say this in such a sacred moment. It really is a jealous guy. I can even suspect that you are making me laugh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" and Twenty years ago, I still think that you are just a girl's waywardness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vadina did not continue to blame with Inham for this seemingly lover The dialogue of the magical flame in her hand has turned into a huge flame-like flame column rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the most arguing woman likes to use fists instead of language to convince people when their fists are bigger than others. Language can only be the expression of the weak. People who don't use nonsense will not go nonsense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame serpent swayed his body with the heat waves of the melting rocks and the dead air rushed toward the back of the mountain. And Sandham continued to fly forward and didn't even look back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis removed a ring on his finger and flicked it. This ring just flew to the front of this huge pillar of fire and burst into the turbulent magical force. . In an instant, a huge colorful magic barrier is formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magical item that can only be used once is usually quite good and can be hung on the finger of Inham’s Marquis, it must not be just good. He was not willing to use it even in the face of the sudden death of the Necromancer like Stephen. This is a defensive spell inspired by a handful of treasures in the Deva Valley. It is a legendary ancient elf's spell that is enough to resist any dragon's rainbow light wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in front of the huge fire snake, this thin, colorful wall of light completely shows the same fragility as its appearance, without any sound, silently Broken. The flame serpent just slightly blocked the hot air of the sultry people and flew forward together with the magma that melted all the surrounding rocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but just breaking through the rainbow light wall. A blood-red sword-like light pierced the head and neck of the fire snake. The blood-red light shattered into the flame body of the fire snake. The flaming flame monster twitched a few times and finally it became a green flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
