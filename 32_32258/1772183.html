			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, although I know that there is probably no chance of winning, but I will not surrender. Asa sighed and looked at the three Knights of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't get in the way." The face of the black slate of the Knights of the Knights with the guns is already angry. He was so puzzled that Lancelot was wasting so much time on this wanted man. It is reasonable to deal with this sinful person who directly ruined him and left a life to return to the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I dragged them and you dispersed yourself." Asa whispered to the back of the Hilton three and then began to bend down the sigh of light. Flashed on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Hilton three did not move the two knights around Lancelot but they moved first. Although they did not directly shoot, they swiftly rushed to both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa screamed and rushed directly toward the knight holding the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'When's a loud bang, the red blood awn on the knife and the white magic wave on the gun immediately began to bite each other like a tear. The red-hot soldering iron sounded like ice. In a twinkling of an eye, the guns collided with each other for dozens of times. Then the two figures were misplaced. Asa was forced back to the original position. The Knights of the Temple were successfully separated from the other with the sword and the original Lancelot. Standing as a team. Although this is only the distance between the three people, the distance between them is very large, but the momentum that echoes each other is far more than the chance of any other person in the middle of the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glory of the Knights of the Knights has a dent in the abdomen but is slowly healing in the radiance of white magic. Asa’s forehead was almost visible. The scars of the bones were bleeding and the blood was flushed. He raised his hand and gave him a treatment. He stopped the blood and turned to the back. He said, “How come you don’t care. Opportunity to go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are too good enough to cover us to escape the boss, but I can't run without it." Hilton sat on the floor. Although he has already returned to a sigh of relief, he is no longer half-dead, but he does not want to run. Just the time when Asa shot to stop the Knights of the Shrine was fleeting. He said that he did not even have to escape Druid and Jessica. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't escape the slow response of people like this." Druid simply changed back to the human form and took off his helmet and sighed. Although he turned into a werewolf, the combat power is unquestionable, but the reaction and judgment are still the old-aged man who looks honest and does not need to say wild and murderous authentic werewolves. Hilton’s old oils on the battlefield are far faster than his reaction to the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Asa glanced at Jessica. According to her degree and agility, she will never be able to run. She can only be unwilling to run but can’t help but feel a little touched. Although this woman and his understanding soon seem to be only a very simple relationship, but from the inside, there is still a strange sense of intimacy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't make yourself passionate, I don't just stay because of you." Jessica faintly glanced at the eccentric Asa. Then reached out and untied the mask. She has been a bit weird since she saw the statue of the Knights of the Temple on the branches with Asa. Just because she always took the mask that only showed her eyes and the situation was urgent, Asa did not have time to pay attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her inexplicably uncovering the undercover Asa three is only a slight glimpse, but the Knights of the Knights with the hands of the silver-powered swords are shocked. Call: "Is it you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot and another Knight of the Temple are all slightly glimpsed after seeing the reaction of their peers. But Asa is even more surprised than them. He couldn't think of Jessica as a casual and he went to bed with the black elves and the knights were old friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...what are you here?" The face of the Knights of the Shrine holding the giant swords is very weird and incredible. Happy, sad, and sorrowful. The incomprehensible elements of countless others are intertwined to completely distort his handsome and calm face and have always lost the supreme mastery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple have stood up straight and staring blankly at the four people in the center. The whole person is as sharp and sturdy as the two-handed sword on his shoulder. But as soon as he saw Jessica's face, there was no flawless posture. In an instant, it has been ruined. Even a small hooligan can easily slap one or two knives behind his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
