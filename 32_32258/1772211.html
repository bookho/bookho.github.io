			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the bursting of the Welshkai flame bursting arrow in the distance and the sound of the gryphon knights who are chasing their own figure but Edric did not feel that he had any advantage. Because he has an orc and a dwarf around him<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a werewolf who talks to him, although he already knows that these orcs have been with people under the teachings of Cedrus. No difference, but the first time I talked face to face with such a beast, I still can't tell the weirdness. Although the spear was just as good as his shot, but the pure power component is stronger than the relatively thin vindictive. From this point of view, it is indeed a masterpiece of these orcs, but from the sense that Aidelik is really Do not want to believe that this beast can actually use vindictive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the goal that countless warriors yearn for. It is not only the representative of combat power but also the embodiment of the spirit of experience. But now this meaning is actually reflected in a werewolf. It is like a wild dog but has won the title of the pursuit of countless people and does not want to believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this 'unwilling' is just a fleeting emotional feeling. The Knights of the Temple are calm and ice-like as the dwarf, no matter when they judge. The tools of the craftsmen are the strongest weapons possessed by a top warrior. Adriek can see that the calm attitudes of the orcs around him are as quiet as the shackles, and they can always wait for the bowstrings. The warrior has the momentum and spiritual qualities. It’s just that this kind of momentum, Adek, almost unconsciously forgets their orc identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And more dangerous is not just the momentum of this warrior. And their equipment. Those huge sizes all represent the same great lethality, especially the huge warhammer in the hands of the ogre. Edrick can not even defend the weapon like a siege hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fell into the woods from the air and immediately the rear of the gryphon knight did not wait to rush to the position where the spear was thrown but saw it It is such a weird encirclement that he has understood that this is a well-designed trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gru didn't come?" Adelk asked him inquisitively about the dwarf behind the ogre. Although this dwarf looks like the height of the dwarves living in the ground, it is slimmer. It is an ordinary human who grows relatively small and weird. This man stood behind many tall orcs, especially like a mountain-like ogres, as if they were a bunch of inconspicuous things, but his look and the look in those eyes were not available to all other orcs. So Aidelik can see that this is the group of orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf shrugged his shoulders and said, "Unfortunately, General Adol, General Gru, did not come here. Because the Knights of the Temple are not only two of you, but both of you. This combination of far and near combat. Arranging a reasonable tactical trap may be more effective than the general savage of General Gru."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tactical Trap... These are Are you arranging the land?” Adek continued to ask him to hear the screams of screams and griffs coming from behind him. The lions and knights who followed him also had many werewolves and The lizard man leaps across the trees and the lions battle the mages to shoot out the magical explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf nodded and said, "It’s the sum of me and Mr. Sedros. For us, the threat of the coalition is far less than that of the Knights of the Great Shrine. It’s big. As long as you are not there, we’ll be much better. So from the beginning we’ve been thinking about how to get rid of you. It seems that my luck is good and I sacrificed two Wyverns but I can finally It’s worth it to come to this place.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Erdek clearly hears all the sounds behind, but dare not look back at the eyes of several orcs around him. Attention is focused on him. He even looked up at the above-mentioned Welsh Kay. He never thought that he really fell into the trap of dealing with himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no thirty or forty miles from the coalition army. But no one is far from Oufu, no matter who is in the situation, no one would have thought that there would be an ambush dedicated to them under such circumstances. The setting of this trap not only needs to be almost crazy, but also dare to let such a small army rush to the enemy's eyelids to set up a willingness to use the Wyvern to lure them and respond to each other in the location and time. Every tactical detail is Must be grasped just right. The only way to do this is to be the leader of the strategist and the tactician. It can be the design of Cedros in a thousand miles, but it’s all just right. It’s all in front of this dwarf. for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Transfer the reel." Edric looked at the flashing blue light on the dwarf that pulled the reel. His pupil suddenly shrank. At the same instant, his figure suddenly sprang up the huge warrior with a roaring sound to take the dwarf. This abrupt blow was already the full power of Adriatic. He didn't even care about himself because of the blow and the empty door behind the side opened. This sudden blow is already killing. He must kill this dwarf here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this person seems to have no power, any orc here can pinch him like a mouse but Adelk is clear For the coalition, even if all the orcs here add up, there is no such a dwarf so he must kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is no doubt that the orcs and the dwarf know it. All the orcs that Adelic moved and moved. Four weapons, up, down, left, and right, at the same time, in a four-way direction, like a giant clip, the guard suddenly slammed into his body. And the huge ogres kept the dwarf behind them as soon as they moved. The huge warhammer also slammed directly into Adriek's gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden light behind the ogres in the loud noise of the gold and iron screams dissipated. The body of the Knights of the Knights also bounced back and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are too big for Adriatic. How can we give you a chance to attack the Bolugan adults? Your rash attack is just giving us a chance. Now you are already at a disadvantage." It is still the reason that the werewolf is talking. He seems to be the commander of the dwarf. The fluent human language is probably the reason he especially loves to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adriek did not answer. Because he only had a blood in his open throat and immediately spurted a terrible wound on his cheek to almost see his teeth and the ribs had at least three broken. It is true that this werewolf is said to have been smashed by his actions. If it weren’t for the brilliance of the armor and the experience he had condensed in countless life and death battles, he would see that he could not be effective in the millennium. It took some of the power to evade the weapons of the three orcs. He is now impossible to stand still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five-meter-long steel gun has been deformed and the giant weapon of the ogre’s hands is not completely distorted. It is the reason that the Knights of the Templar themselves have the upper hand. The ogre gasped a few mouthfuls. The attack was just that Adriatic’s all-out effort and his inability to retreat was a hard hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, if it is on other occasions, I would very much like to be able to discuss it with you fairly." The werewolf once again had a faint vindictive light on his hand. It was a jagged yellow chopper. He was the only orc who successfully hit the Knights of the Temple. "But it's a pity that this is a battlefield where we must kill you by any means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the air. There is also the sorrow of the gryphon behind him and the screams of the gryphon knight. Edric knew that the situation was not good, but the anger of the anger that fell into the trap also completely knocked out his fighting spirit. He suddenly drunk. The white vindictive light mixed with the brilliance of the armor's magic suddenly brightened the white sacred guardian shield on the left arm also flashed out. His right hand war gun left hand guards the dazzling white brilliance as the same statue of God of War. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, the beasts can use the weapons in your hands to try and kill me." Adriek’s roar made the whole forest slightly Trembling. But the five orcs around him did not waver, whether it was a look. The movements are still very calm and calm. Just as the weapons in their hands firmly hold the Knights of the Temple in the center without a trace of flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mid-air lions and knights have been confused. The Pursuit of the War Mage has been fully opened. The cast level of the War Mage may not be too high, but no matter what the magic of the system can come, these black raindrops in the sky are immediately reflected in the white magic. The snow flakes dissipate. The purification of the hands of the combat mages kept the black corpse water falling from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the number of mages is too small. Only one of the four Griffin knights can have a combat mage. What these combat mage can do at best is to eliminate the black raindrops around themselves and have nothing to do with other companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wellskey’s steep command also gave the Griffin Knight a sneak peek at the beginning but the power of the word 'neath magic' It is enough to let anyone bring enough power. In particular, a gryphon knight who had drenched the black corpse water wiped a piece of flesh under the hurried rub. All the gryphon knights who were not battle mage had all gone to the tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These huge birds in the gryphon between the dense trees are not even as flexible as a wild boar. The huge body made them unable to move freely. The werewolves and lizards quickly moved across the branches of the trees to hide. Whether they were direct attacks by the gryphons and the arrows and the magic were escaped by them. They also did not fight with the Griffin knights, but instead threw out a net of nets to join the Griffin together with the knights above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werewolf and lizard people are very skillful in casting nets. Undoubtedly it is specially trained for the battle in this situation. And after they lived on the target, they don’t have to pay attention to the lions and knights who are entangled in these nets. They usually screamed and screamed on the ground for two laps, and then they went silent. The nets left by these nets are also the bodies of the two wounds that are all wounded. The blood left in these tiny wounds is black. These netting networks are inlaid with numerous small sharp blades that produce a black-light blade that can't last long for such a tortoise. Not to mention the knights above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, if the frontal combat power is a combination of a gryphon and a trained knight, it is far stronger than a werewolf or lizard and is also a lion in quantity. The knights dominated but the black raindrops over them forced them into the woods. In such a small space, the gravitational advantages of the Griffin Knights have been completely lost, and the flexibility of carrying a knight's gryphon is far less than that of the lizards and the werewolves, which will fall into strange disadvantages under the strange fighting methods of the other side. Until twenty or thirty gryphonic knights died in this quirky and vicious weapon, several knights with great combat experience suddenly realized that they loudly reminded their companions to walk down the gryphon and form a battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Griffin Knight took the defense of the werewolf and the lizard and temporarily stopped the attack. Because their mission is not really to fight, just delay. Procrastination for the battle to kill the Knights of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black drizzle in the sky is still slowly coming down. Because the source of this black rain is high enough to be scattered enough, it can be kept for a certain period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was only one of the ships in the air. The war mage also rushed into the woods and joined other lions under his orders. The white light surrounded by a circle around his body wrapped him in the ground with a gryphon. The black raindrops were immediately evaporated and dissipated. And his pair is sharper than the eagle. The brighter eyes stared at the man who was falling down at the height. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black spot just above his arrow was shattered immediately. From the fallen wreckage, it seems to be a big eagle zombie. There was another person who fell straight together with the black stinking wreck. Wellskai did not immediately give this person who looked like a corpse an arrow and he knew who it was. I also know that this person can never die under his arrow. He is watching that he is waiting for a blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This free-falling person approaches the ground with a quick degree. Wellske can see the person’s appearance, even the eyes that look at it. See clearly. That is also a kind of look at the opportunity waiting for the opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilska only needs to glance at the distance between the line that the person has fallen and himself is only over one hundred meters. He didn't drive the lions closer to the power and wonders of some of the dead magic. He was also clear that the distance was close to him, at least for him to shoot the eyes of a flying sparrow. And now the advantage is that you don't have to take the risk to get close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang finger grips into a fist and puts an arrow between each finger. Wellske once put on four arrows and pulled the string on the bow. . The four arrows whistle at the same time when the person just fell to a height parallel to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four arrows that were shot from the same hand from the same hand at the same time were shot at four different ways. Only one arrow is in the middle and the other three are pulling out a strange arc in the air. From the left to the right, from the bottom three directions, this strange curve pulls a strange scream in the air. sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of arrow method has already come out with a range of accurate assessment. This is an arrow that is smothered on the arrow and then shot with a special fingering. The one who bows four arrows is only the whole of the 6th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Wellska doesn’t seem to think that the four arrows of God’s Coss is enough. He immediately took another arrow and put on the bow. This time his body's vindictive light was lit up as he had just shot two two-legged dragons. This is what he really killed the four arrows just now is just a stepping or a temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
