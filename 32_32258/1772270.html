			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what the magic of the department, all the magicians are pointing at that direction and shooting at the most destructive magic that they can use. Go out. The magical frenzy on the edge of the forest once again appeared in the hands of the magicians. The icicles of the ice hockey and the thunder and lightning flames screamed and rushed to the place to smash all the smashing and burning along the way. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the explosion of the flames continues to the point where the target is located, and then the explosion is also a magical purgatory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get rid of it. That genie git." Many magicians screamed. * The teachers should be calm and wise because the companion's body and constant fighting disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but at the same time, some careful magicians are present, although this time because of the magician’s magic consumption, it is very small and the distance is far away. Estimated by the report. But the torrent of dozens of high-level magical exchanges did not have the power to be. Whether it is the flame or the power of the explosion, it seems to be small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these seem to be what I call. They have already seen the faintly towering giant trees in front of them. Even with the strength of the present, even if the entire forest is flattened, it is not a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quickly hand over the leaves of the world tree. Otherwise we really want to level it here." A water system* shouted loudly. But this sentence immediately summoned countless arrows almost even the hurricane Aegis of his body was shot and spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well?" Aiden, who recovered his magic at the top of the gas element, looked at the following. He felt that the following seemed to start to scent a breath that he was familiar with. He also felt the last time he was in the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold flash of a bucket of lightning from the hands of Master Eden is not far away and is swooping here to the winged Pegasus along with the knight above. Together with the elf magician, it became coke. This lightning has not been scattered. Instead, he jumped and hit another Pegasus knight near the distance and then dissipated with the nearest element. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only a few Pegasus knights left in the air. This is because the best archers and magicians in the elves are able to ride the Pegasus. The Pegasus knights are equipped with the Elf Master's full strength and the magic of the ten air systems. The Aydin Master has almost announced that the battle is coming to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will solve these guys right away and you will help me to use the last star to fly." Aiden floated up like a ghost without weight The only remaining Pegasus knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Wars Old Tree Luya looked at the sky over the battle. The face was already ugly. The sound of the magical explosion that came from the extreme has been getting closer and closer. Here is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is under the ancient tree in the well. Well water has become a shallow layer of water from the beginning of almost dry. Without the strength of the ancient tree, the power of the sun well is indeed slowly recovering, but the degree of this reply seems to be too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go and move out the three mutant eggs in the old tree." Luya ordered the fineness of her side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of the elves next to them immediately stopped: "But the Queen of Isabel’s majesty has these things that cannot be used. Elder Lloyd also said... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s better to let them slap the whispering squad to the ground?" Luya was almost screaming and sighed and then sighed. . "It doesn't matter, since we even teach the door to the different dimensions. What else can't be done? All these are the majesty of the Queen and the great Marfa will forgive us."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three white giant eggs are placed at the top of the war tree with the quickest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t say that no one will think that this is a biological egg, but a huge white rock. Even the dragon's dragon egg is the same as the pea in front of this huge object with one person. And it's not just the big ones. I don't know how to engrave countless tiny magic runes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
