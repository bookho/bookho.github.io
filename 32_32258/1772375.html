			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the appearance of the bishop of Hamm was originally an orc, the massacre of the bishops immediately turned into a massacre of the orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the other cardinals are far from thinking that this is only because the Pope’s promotion has just been the role of the Cardinal. Magical rumors. And the higher is not his magical rumors but the means and techniques of killing. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three walls of fire are criss-crossing in the orc heap, and the angles of the infinite angles are just right, so that more than a dozen orcs are involved in it, and they are just screaming. The remaining orcs were divided into several parts. And because Hamm did not hide with the other bishops behind the elemental giants, but the meteor who rushed forward ushered in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a half-body-sized meteor hammer rubbing his nose and passing Hamm’s eyes, but he just reached out and grasped the werewolf’s wrists. He is as long as an artist, and the five fingers are stuck in the wrist that is thicker than the average person's calf, and then jumps up. This is just a wolf who has been handcuffed but like a strange scream that has been broken into fifty or sixty knives, and immediately slammed into the big mouth, and the tongue sticks out of the old long groan. The blood that is going out is all the bits and pieces of internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the jump, Inham also ushered in an ogre in midair, his hands were slightly outward, and the two sides of the force shield made the ogres two The huge hand that was just about to close up, he had already taken the opportunity to slam the shoulders of the ogre, and held it on the little ear of the ogre, which was the ogre of the whole body with heavy heads and his head. One of the few places exposed outside. The icicles of a finger-thickness slid with blood from the other side of the ogre, and the huge monster like this fortress fell down like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no connection in the air. He fled in the air with a feather drop. Another Werewolf attacked his feet and jumped again on the werewolf's head. The two eyes of the werewolf flew directly out of the ear and the nostrils spurted out the blood. It seems that someone has ordered an oversized cannon in his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Ham's movements are not as smart and light as a magician, and any thief can't be like him in this dangerous battle. The same demeanor, every movement looks very relaxed and rhythmic. It’s like dancing. When you get rid of the orc, it is often that the blood is not stained. The rest of the cardinals who have not experienced any fierce battles have watched him completely stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are already more than a dozen of the most fierce orcs in the shape of the ups and downs, and the rest of the elements are in the hands of the giants and the Templars. It’s not the opponent’s screaming and escaping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord is in the heart of Lord Inham, thanks to you. I can't think of your skill."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thanks to the Lord's asylum for giving us the power to eradicate these beasts" because Hamm nodded to the other bishops to show their true feelings. It seems that the killing just happened is just the pat on the body. He walked over to Talis and looked at Talis in the arms of Ai Mei, and asked: "What is the little girl like Talis Knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It's none of your business." Talis took Aimei back and took a break. She is aware of the true identity of the cardinal. And just now, when he was uncharacteristically no longer concealing his own strength and unscrupulously slaughtering the orcs around him, Talis felt that his attention had always been on himself and on Ai Mei. It’s just that he is killing the orcs quickly, and he is sweeping away some things that are in the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the discourse is still elegant. But because of the attitude of Bishop Hamm, there seems to be some difference in peace. Perhaps it is to see that he has just squandered so many orcs that he has been swaying. Now, Talis, who is staring at him, feels that his back is cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the bishop said: "This little girl was just sent by the delivery reel and it seems to be scared. You know Bishop Hamin." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course I know. It turned out to be the case." The cardinal smiled a little and relaxed. "I thought she was coming with the Knights of Talis." Talis hadn't had time to react. A faint magical light hit the heart of Ayimei's forehead, which is a rare spiritual magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah? Sister?" Ai Meimei's eyes awake. I saw Talis holding her own and then saw Bishop Inham. "Is it you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bring it up..." Ai Meimei struggled from Talis's hands to find out. But what I took out was a strange shape. "Someone told me to bring you a message to remind you not to play tricks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I naturally won't, she should know that I don't dare. You can rest assured. "Inham didn't pick it up. He just nodded his face and showed off the ecstasy that he rarely saw." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good." Ai Meimei took out an emerald green leaf from her arms. Even in this battlefield where screams and screams are full of violent and dead air, this green can still make people who see it feel a thriving business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the leaves because Hamm’s eyes are shining, but just as he reaches for the leaves, Talis pulls Ayi Mei straight. He embraced his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing? Where did you get the leaves? Can't give this person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You let go." Ai Mei is struggling. But Talis did not want to let her pick up and rushed back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the light in the eyes of Bishop Hamm suddenly changed to a murderous hand, a black line with no wires extended from the finger. The loss of this closeness has made him lose his last patience. But his fingers just turned out of his face, but the horror of the color turned to look at the other side of the arrow on the string of magic actually did not even out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talisi holding Ai Meimei was equally astonished and turned his head in horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murderous gas allows them to forget that even the most important things at the same time have a reaction to the deepest instincts. And it is the kind that completely engulfs them. Let them feel that they are as small as an ant, and they will be murderous. There is only one person who can make such a murderous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Hamm’s conversation with Ayimei did not attract the attention of any bishop, it’s not that they have leisure to care about these looks. Insignificant little things. They are here to support the battlefield. And the most visible and important thing they saw when they solved the orcs in front of them was Lancelot and Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is just two people and still calm. The quiet place to stand straight and bloody is just a step by step toward the other side of the sword. The two people who are slowly and step by step are not even more conspicuous by the surrounding screaming flesh and the flesh and the magical jumps that smashed and killed the orcs and swordsmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter whether it is a fierce battle and then desperately fighting, no orc and swordsmen dare to approach them, even the wild bulls are the same. A large strip of land was automatically vacated around the two. Just focusing on the two people around the chaos is insignificant, as if it were just a group of ants fighting the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The one who is facing Lancelot is the leader of Oufu? Why don't you help?" The cardinal asked this is also all red. The common question of the bishops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subtle grandeur of the two men can even be felt by the bears. The cardinal is self-evident. But they still can't figure it out. Why are the people around you not rushing? Groups are obviously more efficient than heads-up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't go very dangerous." As a warrior, two templars are naturally much clearer than the bishops. It is simply two active volcanoes that can explode at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How dangerous is it? Here, these cardinals join hands to cast spells, even if it is the legendary dragon, it is not necessarily able to resist. At least Bilans It’s much better that Lord Lott fights alone with him.” The two Templars could not explain the fact that several Cardinals were chanting prayers at the same time. Together, they released the paralysis of white magic against Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shenwei is like a prison... set." The white magic of the cardinal is not the same as the power of the pope, even if it can't catch up with the pope. Can compete. Although Gru is nearly a hundred meters away from them, he stands still and is no different from the target. At the same time, several cardinals were at the same time, and the dense light of white magic appeared around the body of Grudi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru is really stiff, although he still hasn’t moved but the subtle momentum has stagnated. It’s strange. Lancelot's immense sword and swords did not take the opportunity to swept away and his footsteps were also awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
