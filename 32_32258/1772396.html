			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Einfast City Magic School. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the large tombs at the back of the college stood there looking at the sarcophagus with the ashes of Bishop Ronis. This person is very young and looks good like a woman, but looking at Shi Yan’s eyes is full of Cang Sang and tired. It is the unique look of the old talents who have experienced the successes and failures of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Lonis is me, Magnus. I didn't expect that I would come to see you. I didn't even think I would be like this now?" Young The man reached out and slammed the face that was not his own and laughed at himself. "Actually, I didn't expect that I didn't expect that I would have a chance to worship you. I didn't expect Deken to prepare for the reincarnation of Vedina. But I finally used it... but I don't know if this body can support it. How long..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know? Aescher died and died in the hands of the student who has been working hard. I also counted on him in the flute. Yagu helped me... Nigen had been so badly hurt that even Moriel was sent by me to kill the king's ring. I got the hand and the black-skinned hilt and the gathering of the sun and the world tree. Ye's kid... Maybe it's only one step away. Even Dakken's unfulfilled goal can be done in my hands... but now it doesn't make any sense because there is something you can't think of that dark star's hilt. Finally, someone was pulled up and was in the bright hall of the Glorious Castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can’t think of it... I can’t think of it... There are so many people who can’t live. We are young. I thought that the world can be held in our hands... "Sighed a long breath and looked at him cross-legged Zuodao sarcophagus smile to the ground. This is the unique look of a hundred-year-old man who is lying in bed and waiting to die. He only has a look at life and is incapable of helplessness. Love and Hatred. Wang Baxiong’s ups and downs are all in his eyes. The only effect is to slowly chew the aftertaste of this life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For many years, Deken has left you and me, and the three of us have chosen different paths. We have gone far enough on our own roads, but at the end of the day. The result is that what we are most unwilling to see, what we did, unwittingly became the cause of this result... Is it true that the name of Vidnina’s chick is no matter what we do. A little dust under the wheel... It’s no meaning to have a lot of intrigue for so many years..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really meaningless to live. Well... Only a stingy woman like Vidnina will pursue what is inexplicable... How many years haven’t you said this? Thirty or forty years...”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice and his eyes slowly swayed slowly and slowly immersed himself in the memory. Finally, he sat quietly before Shijie. It is clearly a young body and looks but it is like a stone statue that has been placed in this mausoleum for a hundred years. Old and lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty... People are basically ready to go." Lancelot and Ryan's great priest appeared in the tomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am gone..." The Pope stood up and whispered the dust on his body. "After all, as long as you are alive, you have to do something, even if the meaning is just to strive to survive as much as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cyster has made a deadly Lasia suddenly and inexplicably closed the transmission of the magical array. The most powerful reinforcement at this time was only Ernest. The 6th place of Dongda was completely unaffected by the previous battle. The strength still exists. Only the strong people here seem to have the hope of confronting the king of the undead. In desperation, the Pope and Lancelot can only come here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a request for help but a joint effort to survive under a greater crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot and the Pope came to the Cathedral under the leadership of Ryan’s Great God. People on the way all the way to the Ryan Grand Principal and the Cardinal are not here. No one is familiar with the two. The current dress is also very common and unobtrusive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no difference in the magical school’s square. It seems that there is no difference between the magical apprentices. The pastors still pray for the peace day. The samurai swordsmen who stood just around the cathedral and sterned the martial arts, let a lot of passing people pay attention. Some sensitive people are whispering every time the martial law of the cathedral is accompanied by a turmoil. But they are not too concerned about it. After all, it seems that every storm can finally calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
