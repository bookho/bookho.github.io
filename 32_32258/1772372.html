			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I think you are better off letting us go. Let go of the leaves of the world tree. I can swear in the name of Marfa to let you leave safely." Elder Lloyd suddenly Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come you are crazy or stupid?" The dark golden skull mask has a faint hoarse sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The thorns and vines that have been changed by the ancient war trees are used to deal with the super poison of the dragon, so that the dragon can not stand your system. Better than the dragon." Elder Lloyd could not smell the scars behind the Necromancer but could smell the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things that are useful for dealing with dragons are not necessarily useful to people." Necromancer said faintly. "You and I both understand that people don't have to use language to test the run."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Lloyd smiled and said, "Oh really? You can actually take it with your skills." The leaves of the world tree leave without leaving us as hostages so troublesome..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not talk nonsense. I remind you that the elf without the tongue can also When the hostages or I can change one.” The necromancer’s hand waved the smile on Elder Lloyd’s face and suddenly became stiff. The whiteness of his head suddenly fell all the way down and only the beard and the eyebrows fell off. Everyone saw the hands of the Necromancer holding a strange shape. In addition to the pointed body, there were two very long canine teeth protruding from the handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the spirit of the Necromancer who is stunned by Elder Lloyd’s words. I don't know if it is from the strange cockroach or from the Necromancer himself or the combination of the two is not revealing but directly infiltrated into the bone marrow. This is the real murderous death that only the life of countless people has been slaughtered. Those who have such murderous possession of such awkwardness will never be a threatening person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words are not just about speaking to the other party, but also to other elves. Actually, he just started and he still couldn’t understand the toxins on the thorns. He used to test the dragon thousands of years ago and he did not try it out, so he will test his temptation. And now the reaction of the other party is enough to explain all the problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a look at all the other elves around. Elder Lloyd's forehead was immersed in cold sweat and it was rushed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let me go all out." The Necromancer dragged the elves and elders and went out to the outside to make way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Lloyd only felt that his blood vessels were almost bursting. He clearly felt that the hand holding his back seemed to tremble. He can now be sure that as long as the elves can ignore the safety of their two elders, whether they use the war tree or the attack, they can definitely knock down the Necromancer and kill more people. But that is better than the leaves of the world tree. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer carrying two elves elders rushed to the edge of the war tree to follow the steps down from the thorns cage Ai Mei Run and follow. The elves gathered together did not dare to test the surrounding area and follow the non-stop movement. Luya didn't know if she was also controlled. She never spoke from beginning to end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Elder Lloyd sighed in his heart. A kind of helplessness and tiredness came. He knew that these elf compatriots were not stupid. Even if you can't understand the condition of this Necromancer, you will never be able to measure the value of the world tree and the relationship between them. Their knowledge cannot succumb to the sacrifice of the two elders and perhaps more elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to make a choice based on reason. The more important you are to give up, the more you need your inner strength. Those who hold the military books and talk about the papers on the papers are absolutely incomprehensible. Those who can fly the brave and strong men's broken wrists are originally one in the hundred. The elves have always maintained a simple and pure nature at that time. But in the current situation, this kindness is really weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you understand the shot rationally, this weakness will make them unconsciously think about whether they will shoot or not, and suddenly sacrifice the two elders. And many of the elves' life necromancers will still run away with the leaves of the world tree. If you don’t shoot, at least two elders won’t have anything... The leaves of the world tree may have a way to get back in the future... It’s not that stupid reason is always a tool for feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves seem to have been plagued with disasters. Not once, not in the passive place, no one did not eat and lose a lot of money. All are due to this weakness. The culture of simple peace that has always followed the teachings of Marfa has preserved the good nature of nature and is not lost in the accumulation of distortions of ** and battle, but also lost power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
