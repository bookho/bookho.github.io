			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial minister’s legs and waist are completely soft. Every bone is feared and turned into a noodle, and the smell in the pants is not even his own. It’s a pity that I can’t afford to smoke the old man in front of me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s head has not been cut off from the top of his head to the forehead by a knife, accompanied by a grayish white brain that walks out every step of the way. Also swaying slightly. He glared at the eyes that had been black and white, and they were walking to the imperial minister with a slow but firm pace. The imperial minister, holding his hand on the ground, barely supported his voice in the back of his mouth and did not know what it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few cavalry are being held down by a dozen bodies. It seems that they are a few delicious food corpses. Although they are slow to fight, they are also afraid to pull the bite. The screams of the cavalry who were able to reach the limits of the human throat were still moving, but the flesh and blood and the internal organs had passed between the hands and mouth of the bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man slowly approached the imperial minister and extended his already shoulders with his stiff shoulders like a good friend expressing friendship and trust. The mouth showed a few teeth inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial minister took all the courage and calmness in his life and took out a jeweled cross from his arms and closed his eyes and said loudly: "I In the name of the god of heaven, you are not clean. Hurry away from the followers of God. Otherwise, just by justice. There is only a kind of hysterical crying. He clearly feels that the old teeth are embedded in his scalp. It is painful to reach the skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Lullah’. It's like a bite of a crisp, crisp apple. This is the last voice he heard in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa only felt a burst of goose bumps on his vest and scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunter Levin’s wife, a woman who had received him very nicely. Her face with a bit of intelligent temperament was almost cut by a knife. Two of them saw the white bones from the rolled flesh. An eyeball has been slashed by this knife. The meridian hangs obliquely on the cheek. on. She was eating a cavalry with the bodies of several other villagers. Her prominent fish, the prominent eyes, looked straight at the cavalry’s abdominal cavity and reached out and took out a biting thing and sent it to her mouth. The voice of the dark red juice dripped down her mouth...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man named Bongbu’s eldest brother pulled off the cavalry’s arm Big bite in the mouth. His neck was almost cut off. Half of the blood probably dried up. The skin was white and the dead white was bright and the red liquid with the mouth still flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scream is already the most beautiful voice on the grass. At least it is a living thing. The other sounds are left with hundreds of corpses of various kinds of bodies swaying and moving. Some of these bodies have a hole in the chest to reveal the internal organs. Some of them have their own heads held in the same hands as some weapons. Some have swollen and walked away to drop an arm or rot into a muddy shape. The viscera was squeezed out of the mouth by the corpse and looked like vomiting. The completely turbid eyes were still staring straight ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of Asa was originally seen much more. In Sandru, he even slept next to the body. Just stopping at it is one thing. It’s another thing to stand up and walk towards you. The red robes were still looking at him in a few decades from the front, as if looking at an expectant date. The eyes of the eyes burst out of the corpse and even more intense than the hundreds of bodies around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it’s being chased in the uninhabited lizard swamp, or in any other situation, the threat is greater in his heart’s survival. ** is also stronger. The toughness in his body is comparable to any of the most stubborn beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but all this is not a threat but a scent of naked death. Any living thing facing this can't be ruthless. The smell of the corpse that I used to smell is now so disgusting. The smell is pressed from the eyes of all sides and red robes, like an invisible finger on the skin. His legs have trembled strongly and gave birth to the urge to run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t escape can’t escape. Asa yelled at herself in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that when people face fear, they will be completely defeated by fear. Rationality and fighting will be eaten in an instant. Nothing will fall into the frenzied escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If people want to eat enough, they have the spirit. It’s not just that people have to eat enough to do things. Are you saying that?" The red robe people looked around the big corpses of the corpses and used the cat-like tone of the mouse. Looking at Asa said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper and lower canine teeth squeezed a small piece of meat on the wall of the mouth and spread the blood in the mouth. It seems that the taste that has been forgotten for a long time immediately rekindles the fighting spirit that is almost drowned by fear in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stretched out his bloody tongue and licked his lips. Once his fighting spirit is lit, he will burn a red bayonet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa took a deep breath and gripped the knife in his hand and bowed like a cat. The red robe stared at him with a smile that was not his own, shook his head and said with a stinking voice: "Don't be so nervous, I just want to"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa suddenly rushed toward him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The young man is too anxious." The red-robed man's dry hand was lifted and lifted as if it were just a casual little gesture. A little green flame jumped out of the chicken-claw and landed on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa in the running slammed his hands and feet and used it on the ground to support the muscles of the hands and feet. stand up. He has been carefully watching the red robes. Every purpose of the sprint is simply to dodge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little green flame fell on the ground and suddenly burst into a green fireball that was as fast as Asa’s original direction. The land spreads past and rolls to the ground where Asa passes by. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pillar of fire like a wild horse rushed to the back of the body just as soon as it touched a corpse flame and grew up wildly. The pillar of fire that rises from the sky raises several high bodies into the air and only rises to the half-empty body. It completely melts in the green brilliance without leaving any traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not look back. He had already fully jumped to the red robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also uses magic to know the time when magic must be saved and prepared. The gap between the two magic is the only chance to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, this time he was wrong and he was still very wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red robes were lifted up by the other hand and it was also a hand that seemed to wrap the bones with tattered leather gloves. But this is not a bit of fat at all. The hand is burning and burning more violently than any torch, as if it was purely made of hell oil and crater sulphur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa knows that he is wrong and should not jump. In the air, he had no room to borrow. He only watched the flame in the hands of the red robe and turned into a huge flamingo in the shape of a large wing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa condensed all his magical power into a fireball and fired at the flamingo. The fireball was almost drowning in the dazzling brilliance of the flamingo, and it was all golden in the sun. The big bird that turned into a fierce singer flew in a hug to melt him in the warm embrace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing he can do with just an animal's instinctive head and legs bent over to wrap themselves as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Firebird successfully captured his prey and incorporated it into his own arms. He immediately began to frantically roll in the air to show his powerful magical energy. I vowed to smash the things in my arms into dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A knife fell from the frantic fireball. As soon as the knife fell on the grass, the grass that came into contact with the knife immediately was burnt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you didn't force me, I really wanted to leave you a corpse." The red robe sighed a little harder. Casting makes him a little hard to load. He looked up at the sky. The arc-shaped shadow is swallowing the sun's rays with the invisible degree of the naked eye. The sky is already dark. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red robes waved the flamingo in the air and immediately flew in the direction of the whispering forest into a phoenix into the grove of the bangs bursting into a burst of red Light. The red robe nodded and waved to the bodies behind him and said, "The door has already opened us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
