			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very beautiful and delicate face, as if it is a very enjoyable expression, spending two fangs on the thin lips, a white skin, delicate skin and slim limbs. They are exposed together to form a kind of sinister beauty. His dark, bright eyes looked at Xiaoxiao as if he were looking at a very beautiful flower and it was like watching a delicious snack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small cockroaches feel that they are smashing goose bumps on their vests. This is not fear and utter disgusting desperation. What can she do in the face of such a monster? How to do it? She wants to vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took a deep breath and tried to calm down and turned to Geffenhardt XVII on the ground and several ministers around to make a gesture of mourning A mantra is out. A burst of light blue light glowed on the emperors and ministers, and they immediately moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small cockroach leached a fine sweat on the forehead and succeeded in using a water group that was not good at it, but her heart was still desperate. This small group of dispelling magic has made her feel that the power is not caught, and the vampire's powerful slowness that settles everyone in the tent is just a hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come and take me off, I am dragging him here." To Klis and the group of ministers, they turned and turned to look at the vampire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vampire has been standing there since she turned and she has been standing there without moving her back without her defense, but quietly waiting for her to finish these things. Turned back again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your magic is very good. You can use the flame or the small range of water to dispel the magic. I don't know if there is anything else that will surprise me. Degar didn't move, just smiled and looked. The smile is still fascinating, but the little child is watching the cruel smile of the insects caught in their glass bottles. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several ministers helped the emperor to find a way out of the tent. There are two sergeants guarding the gate and the hole burned in the tent is in danger. Behind the vampire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid." "It’s not enough to cut the tent with a knife."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leather tent was cut and a minister could not wait to take a step outward but suddenly appeared in the hole Three huge dog heads. The minister was dragged out and screamed. He had just opened his head and was dragged into three pieces of internal organs and blood. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor and other ministers were immediately scared to re-soften the ground three-headed dog and threw the body of the mouth into a bite to the soft emperor on the ground. Next to the Chris, he quickly hugged him and fled to the side to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Puppy goes out. As long as you don't let people run, don't disturb the beautiful atmosphere here." The vampire gracefully waved the three-headed dog and immediately retired. Go out. His black jewel-like scorpion has been staring at the little cockroach and is reluctant to leave. He made a graceful gesture like an invitation to dance. "Miss, can we start?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small as he clenched his teeth and leaned over and untied a sword from a minister to dance in his hand. A few swings open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope you don't lose your senses and courage because of fear because it is the most irreplaceable part of your incomparable beauty." The vampire looked at the sharp one. The weapon is laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no slamming on a sword and he was stabbing him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Degar smiled and opened his hands to greet the sword in a hug. Jianfeng pierced his white skin very smoothly through the **jianjian from his back. His face was still smiling and his arms were like a passionate lover, and he stabbed himself to the little shackles he wore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his relaxed smile immediately became stiff and suddenly became angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a muffled sound, the little cockroach flew down a few meters and fell to the ground. She bent her belly like a shrimp and painfully twisted her facial features completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Degar didn’t bother to take the sword that he had run through and draw a knife from underneath the sword. It was the small silver knife that had just been placed on the table. Now the whole handle has been inserted into the chest and the place where the knife is inserted is bursting with smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third time." Degar looked at the face of Xiao Yan, who was still painfully shrinking on the ground, and it was no longer so easy. "If it is a vampire who is a few levels lower than me, this is the third time. Is that a knife a real weapon? The sword is just a slap in the face of my eye." He sighed and sighed again. "You are so amazing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little cockroach is still curling up, the slender body is shrunk into a group of shivering as if there is no room for struggle. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Degar did not stare at her for a while and shook his head and said, "Is that foot is very heavy and painful? I am very sorry but you should It’s all right. Since you can use the Fire Wall and dispel magic, you should have no problem with the treatment. It’s so ridiculous. What are your plans? Wait for me to attack with magic at close range? Then I will take a little Cutlery to attack me? Maybe you are thinking that a silver knife can hurt me so many inserts is more effective?" He snapped a finger into the two ghosts from the hole in the tent. "I don't dare to look down on you now. You are the first human woman I dare not look down on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small squat slowly from the ground Her head was already messy, with a trace of blood and desperately looking at the vampire in front of seeing her own attempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah. Such a look" Degar snorted and closed his face and was completely intoxicated in his own confession or heartbreaking look. "This beautiful, brave and clever woman finally showed me the desperate expression of a Persian cat under the scalpel. It’s so beautiful. I can only eat you because I can’t get you. I’m so sad and helpless. Your expression of this moment, my feelings at the moment can at least remind me of the recollection of hundreds of years. In my boring and endless blood-sucking career, meaningful things have long been gone. Only these beautiful and shocking moments are worthy of me. Pursuit." He waved his two ghosts toward the little scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Boom’. A small fireball smashed the tangible and unqualified body of a ghost, but it was only a blink of an eye. The white mist re-condensed into a complete appearance. These undead monsters do not have a physical body. It is just a group of ideas and magical energy extracted from the human body. If it cannot be completely crushed once, it can re-aggregate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A phantom has caught the hand of Xiao Yan. Although these monsters can't even pick up a leaf, the undead energy that makes up the body can stop the flow of energy in the living body and paralyze it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sorcerers grasped her body firmly and immediately stiffened even the lightest micro-movements could not struggle. Degar went up and reached out and hugged her. She sighed, "When can such a beautiful woman be able to taste it again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small His face was already white and his teeth biting his lower lip seemed to be struggling and seemed to be forcing himself to not speak for himself. You can also tremble in the head and neck of the moving bullets. All the emotions in the slender eyes have been worn by fear and helplessness to become desperate to reveal the sika deer like the sika deer that will be swallowed by the python. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vampire looked at the desperate expression on her face. The glamorous face was so intoxicated and sad as an artist immersed in his work. He put his blood-filled lips on the white neck and slowly swam on the delicate skin. The gentleness and sensuality seemed to be like a teenager touching the body of the first love lover. The place where you walked left a mark of blood and wrinkled a small ripple around it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last he showed off his sharp teeth and bite. Yin Hong’s blood immediately rushed out of the white skin of the snow and flowed into the mouth of the vampire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," Cris cried and screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But another sharp squeak immediately overshadowed her scream. This huge sound almost pierced the eardrum of everyone in the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screaming is the vampire who is still so elegant and contented. His reaction was so great that even the two ghosts lost control. Xiao Yan broke free of his hands and caught his bleeding neck. The blood vessel was only hurt and not bitten. She stopped the blood immediately after using the treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people were surprised to see the vampire who was jumping and jumping. He is now like a mouse that has been boiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Degar’s mouth is smoking, not just smoking. His lower half of his face almost boils. It seems that he was not in the blood but a piece of molten steel. He seems to want to hold his mouth but the hand does not dare to take it. Not only the expression but also every skin and muscle in his body is convulsed because of the great pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood was on Degar's body and it was like a dripping hot pot that immediately boiled out of a sizzling sound. The vampire under the fierce anger was suddenly in a boxing voice, and the flank of the flank ribs broke. The whole person flew out and slammed into the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vampire continues to scream. He suddenly picked up the sword on the ground and slammed his whole body down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Degar is as crazy as he continues to slash his sword and slap some other blood on his body. Every sword is so savvy and unscrupulously cut a large piece of meat as if it were the most hateful thing in the world. Until all the blood-stained areas were cut down, his original slim body was almost incompletely shaped. But his last half of the expression seemed to be relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cut body continues to be eroded by the blood above and quickly disappears completely. The whole person who touched Degar turned into a mist and then slowly condensed again. His re-condensed body returned to its original appearance, but it seemed to be very weak and seemed to stand still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vampire jumped on a minister and bit his neck and sucked. The graceful demeanor of the past has disappeared completely. His limbs are open and squatting on the ground. His movements are like a luxuriant wild beast. His eyes are also alert and look at the little cockroaches that fall over there. The expression of hunger and thirst when smoking blood is like the wolf that has been hungry for decades. The face of greed, venomous and flamboyant has been completely distorted. It seems that if you can't wait, you can suck the body under your mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor minister only screamed for a half-sighing limb like a frog in the mouth of the snake, and as the blood color faded on his face, the whole person Pale soft down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Degar got up and flew to another minister, blood hangs from his mouth until the body of the red dew is more red on his white body. The long limbs clung to the prey in his arms like a strangely huge white spider blood violently pumping in his mouth. The loud snoring and horror were unparalleled in him. Finally someone couldn't help but started crying out loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sucking the blood of three people, Degar seems to have finally recovered his strength and stood up again. However, he still watched with trepidation that the little cockroaches who fell to the ground could not easily approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danger. The vampire's heart has a long-lost fear that is almost forgotten. Those bloods that do not know what strengths are completely repelled by his physique are dozens of times more powerful than the most advanced holy water, almost completely destroying the structure of his entire body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Degar frowning and looking at Xiaoxiao seems to have fainted. The punch under his pain was not something that the human body could bear. He directed a sergeant to go forward. Xiao Yan still did not respond. Degar had a gesture. The soldiers raised the knife in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is going to save my sister?" Chris stood up and screamed as if to rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Degar frowned and even gestures did not use Kliss to fall to the ground as soon as the wood was cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman is really an ignorant animal. Whether or not this dialogue is incomparably vulgar, at least certainly has no practical effect. What can be done to stop him in this situation? He slammed his knife and slashed his knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, a loud bang of ‘Boom’ really broke through the tent and flew in to knock the squadron away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vampire looked at the past with horror and anger, and now the shadow of the one who flies in to save the man is actually a three-headed dog or three heads. The body of a dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-headed dog has a huge three heads and now only half of it is left. There are two in the body that are completely unknown. Some tattered pieces of meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am late, everyone is fine. Everyone can rest assured that the monster has been solved by me." A man walked out of the hole that the three dogs had hit. Come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone looks to this person who appears in time and speaks of the great words of the Savior. But it seems that this is more horrible than a vampire. He is like a purple-black person who has been soaked in the blood and dried. The whole person is solidified. The whole person has a strong scent. The body is full of light wounds and panting is like standing still. It is stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is like a dead frog or lying or kneeling on the ground. There are several pale and sinister bodies. Most people seem to be alive but the expression on their faces is ugly than dead. And standing is the two scorpions and two ghosts and a young man with blood on his mouth. He can't figure out what's going on in any case. This is totally different from what was arranged in the Bishop's plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the plan of the bishop's adult, those undead monsters just came out and injured several guards to scare the emperor and the ministers. But when he first arrived, the monsters that should have been inside were actually all outside and it was as if they were patrolling the police to see him approaching the crazy attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the zombie outside being wiped out by you?" The young man looked at him and asked a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Asa was a little confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young man of the whole body nodded to him as if he smiled and said: "You look so good. I am busy inside." I haven't noticed the outside movement yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the death of the three-headed dog and the vampire's 'powerful' comment makes this just appear The new savior is full of hope. A few ministers who were kneeling on the ground saw his body, even though it was all bloody and ruined, and the sergeant’s attire suddenly called the pig: "The sacred man is saving his life. He is an evil vampire who will destroy him and save us." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Degar sighed and turned to the stomach of a rescuer who shouted loudly in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the flesh and blood of the internal organs, the vampire's feet all stepped into the body of the minister and almost stepped on it. However, the minister’s hands and feet are still twitching and screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Degar added a fierce foot to his head to calm down. The vampire faintly said: "I said that you should not be noisy. And I forgot to tell you that I hate others to help me introduce." He used his feet to crush the sound of the bone fragments below to make the tent completely quiet again. The horrific power of the horror once again overwhelmed everyone’s intentions of being completely overwhelmed. The ministers and emperors who had been relieved of the slowness were also afraid to move like frogs under the mouth of the snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vampire? Asa took a breath and took a step back. I almost wanted to turn and run away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was only one three-headed dog from the Magic Academy, four higher zombies, and ten sorcerers. These are the secrets that Asa and the Marquis went together to pick them up. They never grabbed any of the vampires in the Vampire Magic Academy. There seems to be no such monster at all. Even if they are there, they will never dare to catch it. Although the church's categorization method puts the vampires together with the zombies into the undead monsters, it is in fact not the case. It is like the same flesh and blood but the human beings and the worms are not the same thing. Even strictly speaking, these monsters are excellent when they are humans, and they are masters of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa has no time to think about why this monster will appear here. When I was dealing with the zombies outside, I had already consumed the little physical strength that was almost exhausted. The treatment used along the way and the fireball that last fried the three-headed dog also left the magic power. . According to his own judgment, the best way to do this is to turn around and escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really escape? impossible. Such a dangerous situation, although the emperor's kneeling seems to be able to ignore these princes and nobles, not to mention but there should be a person who should be here must not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s secret prince, the sorrowful ghost, he looked nervously and finally saw the little cockroach on the ground. Her face was still rosy, and the transparent paleness of the bodies without the corpses seemed to faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa breathed a sigh of relief but immediately had a goose bump because the whole body ** looks like a fair-skinned little man’s monster is using A strange look looked at him from top to bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Weird and strange." The vampire's eyes turned up and down in Asa as if he were a pretty woman and also a whole body. "Although it is very weak now, I can see that my physical and magical abilities should be very good. The figure is also reasonable. It should be that you should be my first hand, but why do I always feel that you hate it? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably you don't fit my keen aesthetic intuition." Degar reached the conclusion and gently reached out and announced the death penalty for this nasty person. "So you are going to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To each other. I want to kill you too." Asa replied gnashingly. But he is not angry or excited, but he is using his strength in eating his brains to recall various legends and think about what can be done to harm this monster<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sun? It is now noon. cross? Even the shackles and the ghosts will not be afraid of that stuff. garlic? It is hard to imagine that this kind of thing that is eaten every day can also defeat the evil spirits, save the evil spirits, save lives and seek survival, and now where to find? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn't had time to understand. Degar’s hands waved at the tents and the two had been moving like two furnishings without moving. It’s not the clumsy movement of ordinary cockroaches, but it’s flexible and fluttering like a monkey. The two ghosts floating in the air also rushed toward him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These zombies and squats are not the kind of inferior mass produced by Vedina when they whispered in the whispering but the early death The spiritual masters spend a lot of time to refine the warriors. If it weren't for this, the Marquis would never let the few ministers attack the hunting ministers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s sword completely dissipated a Chad. But at the same time another rusting knife left a long wound on his back. This monster is not too strong and the weapon is not sharp, so the wound is not deep. Just as dangerously, this other smashed Asa suddenly saw the vampire walking towards the little cock that was still fainting on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing? I am here." Asa yelled and hurriedly evaded the two ghosts and rushed toward the vampire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know. Don't worry, it will be your turn." The vampire didn't look at him. He just waved a gesture with one hand and read a few words. Single syllable mantra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong slammed Asa slammed into the ice wall on the ice wall, I don’t know when it appeared in front, and he felt his bones It seems to be broken too. He was thrown to the ground and two ghosts just swept past him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vampire continued to walk over there and picked up the sword that the little cockroach had just used to pierce him. He did not forget the strange woman that was the real danger. Although she has been unable to move, she may have died, but he is not at ease. He has to go and cut down the beautiful head and watch the dangerous blood flowing into the ground. Right, the pretty girl seems to be her sister. No matter whether this strange constitution is bloody or not, it must be killed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful women are of course lovely and beautiful but only plaything props. He must not be soft when he kills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the guy who just slammed on the ice wall and stunned and climbed up and rushed toward him and even chased after him. The two ghosts shouted and raised a hand and stabbed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this person is very weak, this one has also been hit hard. Now even the footsteps are a bit sloppy, but this sword is extremely fierce. A sword that has been focused on all strengths and degrees. This is actually a sword that is desperate to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Degar smirked and ignored the sword that was about to arrive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not afraid of desperately or even likes others to desperately because he is simply deadly and can only fight for others’ lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two long swords pierced two chests at the same time. Degar clearly felt that the other side’s sword had passed through this feeling in his body. He had felt it many times. He had a similar taste of swallowing a whole cold little fruit. He preferd his hand. The incoming cut into the touch of a living **. This person's muscles are very tight and even from the sword front can feel the vitality of the body, but this beat will soon disappear. Degar is a little bit enjoying this feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people have come together. Jianfeng also wears a sword tip through the back of both bodies, but with a bright red blood on it, it is still spotless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Idiot." Degar was disdainful and scornful looking at the inferior creature in front of him who was dying to death. But what he saw was nothing more than a feeling of self-inflicted on the face of the net without fear and dying. The bloody face that was full of blood was even distorted by the burning of fighting spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, two ghosts have already rushed over and Degar, who has changed his position, almost came together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Boom’ The entire big tent was smashed into pieces by this huge explosion from the inside. Most of the people lying on the ground were shaken out and there were a few more close-ups that were even rolled up by the air. There are more than ten people who have been shocked and shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ghosts of pale and unqualified bodies are pulled apart and fragmented in the violent magical force and the storm of airflow. The structure of the magic as a whole disappeared in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the dandruff falling in the rain fell on the ground. This is the long sword that was inserted in the vampire's chest. The vampire has disappeared and has not even left a body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other sword is still still on the chest of Asa’s chest and still reveals from behind his back. He was also blown out by the explosion, lying on the ground, not moving, his face full of fighting spirit and strength is already dead. Finally, the only person who can be seen by a long sword is the only expression that can be found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he suddenly moved slowly. He slowly and painstakingly reached out and grabbed the hilt on his chest and carefully pumped the sword from himself to the outside with a little care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sword is not so much punctured from his body as it is ‘wearing’ the past. Squeezing into the gap between the muscles of the chest, rubbing the heart and lungs from the side of several large arteries, only hurt the chest and the muscles behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa finally has to admit that it has not been done for a long time in Sandru. Every day, I watched the old man take the human organ out of the body and put it into a toy like a toy. Although he didn't have such strange interest, he also knows the human body well. And the refinement of meditation makes him feel very sensitive to every part of his body. He is very clear about the position of each muscle and organ. He can even make a slight movement to make him dangerous. Extreme action has been successful. As he moved forward toward the front of the sword, he had adjusted his position so that the sword could pass through his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed his breath and did not dare to hold the hilt tightly and carefully and slowly pumped outward. Jianfeng is holding a large artery and even every beat of the heart can leave a very weak scar on the wall of the tube. As long as the scar is a little deeper, once it breaks through the fragile line of defense, the blood immediately It will be sprayed outside like a fountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword was finally pulled out of the body and Asa Chang Shu breathed. The chest and back are still bleeding. Fortunately, it is only the muscle damage. Now he has not even used the weakest healing spells. Not only that, but within a few days, he couldn't use magic. Just this fireball almost squirted all the essences in the heart, liver, spleen and lungs together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still can’t think of any weaknesses in the vampire until now. But no matter where he is ‘weak’, he will not be “strong” after he has blown him up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of 'Zizi' voice came to Asa and turned around to see that the vampire, who should have been blown up, is holding a lady, just two, let this The nutrients pale and dried up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s so dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. The scatter between the rush has cost me a lot of energy." Degar threw the body and stood up and put out his tongue and licked his mouth. Blood on the blood. His tongue is sharp and long, and the red is full of blood and his white skin forming a striking contrast. Although he kept praising the opponent, his attitude was very relaxed, and the relaxed and charming smile was completely restored. "Actually, I really want to see what kind of tricks you can still play. Unfortunately, your body is like an empty pocket that has been dried up." His bright red tongue smirked at Asa. "No?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes" Asa only admitted that it was. Although there is still some point in physical strength and vindictiveness, what use is it for such a monster? He can feel his face turning to look at this monster. "Fuck. Can you really kill this bastard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death? This is a virtual word for me." The vampire slowly came towards him. The sense of superiority and triumph is so weird in such a monster. "But you can feel it very quickly right now"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clyice lying on the ground over there finally screamed and shouted: "That The monster is afraid of my sister's blood"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Asa’s face changed. He changed because he saw the face of the vampire changing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood-sucking monster that sounds unbelievable and not afraid of the sword is not afraid of magic will be afraid of a person's blood. But the reaction of the vampire at least shows that this is indeed the case. Asa dropped a sentence: "Why don't you say a stupid woman?" Turned and ran to the little cock lying on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But vampires are faster. He didn't use the magic and he didn't have time to use it. He just flashed a light smoke. He appeared in front of Asa and had a boxing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not hide or let a vampire have a chance to use magic. Asa pointed out: "Get out of the way." All hopes are on this hit. He put all his fighting spirit and strength on his fists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not very crisp and loud voice The vampire looks white and elegant and has been broken like a crisp apple. Asa’s fist cast was directly hit by his seemingly thin chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of a dozen ribs breaking together became a two figure suddenly separated by a body and flew out to the ground and then rolled a few laps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Degar looked at himself with only a few pieces of meat hanging on his wrist and then looked down at his chest and his ribs were not broken but around The flesh was smashed together and the punch left a big hole in his chest that almost passed through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the opponent who had been hit by his own knee and broke his ribs and shook his head and shook his head and said: "There will be magical use of vindictiveness." I have never heard of the warrior before. You seem to be a priest? If you can use the deep white magic, even I am afraid of you." The vampire walked slowly and grabbed Asa’s clothes. With one hand, I will raise this person who is much taller than myself. "But it's a pity, so I have to kill you more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the vampire saw that the dying person was dying. It’s a bit ridiculous and it’s a bit easier. That doesn't look like a person who knows who is going to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Degar is strange but he is absolutely not worried about what kind of tricks this person can play. This person has indeed exhausted all the magical vindictiveness and energy. He can hit a cow with a full knee and the whole man can still have half a life. His body is very strong. As for the rest of the people here, they can hardly move, even if they can move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exclude all possible variables. He is very worried and frowning. "What are you laughing at?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I laughed at me too benzene." This person is still laughing and laughing more and more happy. It seems that benzene is simply crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You benzene? Why do I think you are crazy?" asked the vampire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am now in fact I can easily deal with you." This rib is broken and people who are struggling are still laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vampire smiled and asked: "So I ask you how do you deal with it?" He put the other hand on the head of the already crazy person and waited for it. Hearing the final answer and then crushing his head like a watermelon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person opened his mouth but did not answer but a big spurt of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood became foggy under the strong squeeze of the mouth and lungs and the person deliberately turned his neck while spraying. Bloody skull cover squirted Degar's face and face. Then an unbeatable scream came out immediately from Degar's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vampire's original small and exquisite mouth is now wide open to the ear, as if it is not so big, it is not enough to make such a cry. Asa’s ear and nose in front of him immediately shook the blood with this scream. This sound seems to pierce people directly. The people who were bound by the slowness of the ground all used their strength to raise their hands to rub their ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Degar’s cusp only lasted half and he was dumb. He dropped Asa and tried to pick the sword on the ground. The blood that had sprayed on his hand had completely eroded the limbs there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
