			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it so interesting? Be sure to check it out." Bolugan listened to Asa and said that the overview of the city of Oufu immediately expressed great interest. . He was originally responsible for handing over the local officials to the court. Now there is nothing to do. "It's really good to be able to manage the orcs. It's a great city to build such a city. It's a fantastic city. I have to go. It's a very creative way of criminal law. It used to be art." The manager of the Brakada’s manager’s big eyes is full of light. It’s the lascivious person who heard the fascinating look of the world’s famous dish. He was completely intoxicated in the rough city that imagined the orcs. "I will leave tomorrow and go tomorrow." He screamed at the table. “The boss has another pound of roast beef.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa reminded him: “I’m going to fight in the west, are you going to die now?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course I will go around from other countries. I will earn enough for your Fulu." Bolugan is proud of himself. "I don't know why you think that your friend must lose? Even I can see that his chances of winning are much larger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I think he It’s no use for such a person without status status to get the championship. It’s better to deliberately lose the trust of the prime minister to do so. He can do so I thought he would deliberately lose the game.” Asa plays high If the prime minister is giving Rodhart Chen a bad pain, he will judge it as his own. "I am worried that he will be excluded by the prime minister for the momentary impulse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"瞎 worry." Bolugan said with a sigh. "He will definitely have more advantages when he wins. The imperial court is not the prime minister. The group of people can only cover the sky. This defeats the prime minister's nephew. At least the military ministers are seen to see him and Elni. The family has nothing to do with it. The military is in need of a person who can have the affinity to win the hearts of the people. It is just that the emperor and his wife like him so much. He is more promising in the military than in the Elni family who is only used by the only relatives. Hello, do you know what is the most valuable resource of the age? Is it talent? I just saw this and asked your friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh? This?" Asa stunned. It seems that this is the truth. "Well, this is the case. The prime minister bought him. He agreed to come down. If he really wants to win the game, why don't he refuse to face it? Isn't he so afraid of angering the prime minister?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are wrong again." Bolugan again shot his judgment. "I am afraid of the prime minister. In the selection of the Paladins, it is a big crime. It is a big crime. It is even more risky to kill your friend. Or you can only seize this handle by your friend. Indiscriminately deal with him. Good means. Good minds and good intentions." Bolugan adults bite a piece of beef and chewed in the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good intentions. Asa suddenly remembered the situation when she had just met Rod Hart a few months ago. At that time, he was still very naive, and now the things in his mind are far from what he is. It seems that this person is very fast once he matures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great Bolugan continued to express his high opinion: "I used to see him when I saw him in Bracada. It was probably with The relationship between the Dukes of Mulak. Learn the good guys and the bad guys and learn the bad guys. Follow the witches and learn to dance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know the Duke of Mulak? Asked Asa. He now knows a little about the things in the court. The good name of the Duke of Mulak is well-known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand. But from his good name, he knows that he is a master of tricks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the most liar person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person who never lie is the one who will lie most."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because this shows that no one is lying, no one is wary of him. For two decades, the Duke of Mulak was promoted in the Empire. The fastest and least traceable one. How can you climb from the following to the current position without playing? Do you think that the officialdom is to work hard with honesty? The key is that he has such a clean and innocent Good reputation This is the master of the real means of play. If you are too big, if you don’t reveal the traces, you will be the real master. You see that your friends know that such a talented person has the ability to vote. He entrusted with the task but he did not allow him to keep the identity of a civilian population which can be powerful tools "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"Is it already indicated how the assets of the company can attract others to invest? Naturally, it is necessary to say that this is a clear and innocent person until the others have already put this business into the fight and then show it again. Proof of title is not an effort to buy and sell. Isn't this a profitable sale? As for the property book that is of great importance, it is naturally the hero who rescued the princess from the cave of Brakada. When I was in Bracada, I saw that he was very fond of the princess. As for the effect of maintaining his civilian status, you also saw that this is a good way to win the hearts of the people. Everyone likes the hero who is born in the wilderness and rises up. Arrange the chess path of this important piece of chess in such a way that it can’t be played except for the honest Duke of Mulak. It’s really brilliant.” The style of Bolugan’s talk about the expert is completely out of proportion to his appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said that you are truly brilliant." Asa had a sly look at the rough dwarf in front of him. "It’s really a waste to feed your mind like you don’t do those things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polugan smiled. His smile should have only slightly expressed some self-deprecating but the wide mouth was slightly open as if it were a deliberate teasing. "Doing this is not just a matter of needing a head. It is more important to think. It is necessary to be willing to think about the fact that others must be scrupulous about the consequences. What kind of position does others have to listen to? Then the resulting reactions will have an effect on other people, etc. These things are more complicated than the Alchemist's dispensing drugs. I don't have the ability to do it. I can only see at a glance what kind of tricks they play." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard.x." Asa swears a swearing saying: "How can one of my heads be so fascinating that I am now losing confidence in my intelligence? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's a little smart." Bolugan said in a book-like tone. "People who are obsessed with the power of the tricks are actually the weak assimilated by the world full of power. The real great wisdom is the real strength, the firm self-consciousness is not confused by other emotions and the environment. Such people I don't want to compromise with the world, so I don't seem to be rebellious with the environment. In this kind of people, the world is equal to myself. Can it be spiritually equal to the world? Isn't this really strong? For example, you "And me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha, this is a flattering sound." Asa smiled. "Unfortunately, I know that the very weak officials can call thousands of people to cut the two of us into a bolognese."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because the spirit and the reality are always two different things." The Bolugan adults read another sentence and then smiled and screamed at the big die. "I endorsed it. I used to be the administrator of my hometown library. I am full. I have to prepare for the trip." Bolugan’s last piece of beef sat down satisfactorily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sent away the Bolugan adults and returned to the big house in Sandru. Although he was promoted to the official immediately, he still lived in the big house of Sandru. He didn't think about changing a place and didn't think that there was anything wrong with the place where the priests lived. In his opinion, this was only a temporary add-on to the bishop's adult. However, a few days later, there was a wind commentary saying that he believed in devoutness and ambition. He was still in the high position and was still engaged in the basic work of soothing the undead. This noble morality and cultivation is a model of all priests. He also wonders that he is clear that he has not made a name for himself, but he is getting better and bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please post it today. Sandru is complaining that these messengers have disrupted his clean life because they have seen that the situation is not vomiting or urinary incontinence, which scares the back and legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the days since Bishop Ronis appointed his priesthood, he has received invitations from the Duke of Mulak to attend various dinners and dances almost every day. Every time there is reason and enthusiasm that makes him unable to dodge. So every night he can truly appreciate the prosperity of Wang’s real life. Surrounded by aristocratic women and young ladies dressed up in flamboyant costumes, the aristocratic youths who are imagining the unimaginable foods are constantly registering on the fans of the beautiful women and then waiting for the song to sweat and then everyone Take your arm and walk somewhere else to continue to sneak a sip of sweat. Many ladies and girls are also very interested in this new priest. Unfortunately, his famous belief in piety and a temperament that does not belong to this atmosphere make them difficult to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finest wine and pastries are really delicious. Even the most common fruits have to be engraved with the same variety of honey. Asa first saw it. I still don't know what it is. The full-fledged luxury is indeed an eye-opener. The gold and silver instruments are crystal lamps. The clothes worn by the servants of the wines, Asa all recognize that it is the village of the hometown who took out the attire every time. Although it is such an eye-opening Asa, I feel that I am more energetic when I sleep in the wild and sleep in the tree to drink the blood. He also remembers the shape of the living starving people who have seen it with his own eyes. He has heard that there are places where famine people have to exchange their own children and eat them. He has developed a measure of money that uses the method he learned from Bracada, so he doesn't feel that these things are great anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
