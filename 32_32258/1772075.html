			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire city of Oufu has completely fallen into silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa knows that the house he is standing in is sleeping with three half-orcs and two adult cubs can be distinguished from the frequency and thickness of breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vague and arguable strange sounds came from a distance. The soft contact friction gradually became heavy and then alternated slightly. This is the sound of the thick meat pad on the wolf's foot on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-one saw it. As the time of the sound judgment is exactly the same, a werewolf appears from the corner of the street not far from the front. This is one of them who just caught him. They should be responsible for nighttime garrison. They do not use lighting tools such as torches for superior night vision and hearing that humans can't match. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa also thought this way like everyone else an hour ago. But now he knows that it is not so at least not absolute. As long as he concentrates his mind, whether it is auditory or visual, he can be more sensitive than usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time probably because of the state of mind, the level of meditation is far more profound than ever, and it is more prominent than any other time. It’s not just the ** and the feeling that there has been a great improvement. Even all the distracting thoughts in my mind are completely gone, so the only remaining one is clear and clear – take the book back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five-tone, five-color, blind, five-minded. It is naturally stronger to abandon other ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The werewolf turned to the next street and listened to its subtle footsteps gradually drifting away. Asa climbed the wall and slowly slipped down and stepped on the ground. Even the dust did not arouse his movements more softly than a tree snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the five senses of the Ming Rui even on every place on the ** also had a strange feeling. He can now control the finest muscles in each of the most subtle muscles to clearly perceive how muscles and bones work together under the power of blood flow. It seems to be a bystander to observe the dissected insects. I can see all parts of my body without any emotions. But on the other hand, all the feelings become a whole spiritual will and the body is not divided. Each of the smallest movements is under the control of one's own consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be more sensitive and more saturated than the beast, you can let the fighting spirit and killing come out at any time. This is a perfect state of mind. He can also feel how vitality flows in his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step by step. The sole of the calfskin is very soft. There is also a contact between the mat and the floor to make no sound. The front end of the foot refers to the strong muscles of the arch at the root of the foot and perfectly distributes the falling force evenly until the time of the fall is not allowed to overburden at a certain point in time. The joints and muscles of the entire leg work together to ensure that the placement of each step is accurate. The center of gravity of the body is lowered very low, and the soles of the feet and the ground are completely compliant with the sound of no friction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Hall is not far away. Another footstep of the werewolf came from the front. He can now be the first to present the other than the werewolf. Asa turned and sneaked into the gap between the two buildings without any sound and sounding like a tangible and subtle shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps of the werewolf are approaching. I heard that this should be another werewolf who just caught him. Its one foot is awkward. Asa did not hold his breath and could not hold on for a long time. The heart and the violent voice were more likely to be present. Instead, he opened his mouth and placed the breathing channel as spacious as possible to allow breathing to occur at the slowest degree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The werewolf’s footsteps did not stop passing through here and gradually went away. Asa drew out of the crack in the house like a shadow, and the clothes on his body did not rub on the rough surface of the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a stone house behind the magnificent City Hall. As simple as all the other buildings in the city, here is the residence of the Lord of Cadlos and General Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is like a gecko, slowly leaning against the rugged walls outside the city hall. I don't know if the illusion of the extremely sensitive harmony of the body seems to be part of my body. The folds and fibers above are the extension of their skin and muscles that control the sound that is not caught by the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are mice in the front ten steps and two meters deep. There is a sound of a mouse burrowing. A four-legged snake jumps from the crack in the stone house wall to the ground. A sound blows across the gap between the buildings to create some irregularities on the uneven surface. In addition to the whistling, there is no breathing sound around the body. There is no one in the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why no one knows that Asa doesn’t know and doesn’t want to know that no one is best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house is open. It is not surprising that the houses in the city of Oufu have no habit of closing. Asa walked to the door and blocked the door with her own body, so that the light could not leak out and stick out a finger. A spark sparked between the fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame beats very hard between the fingers but Asa is very satisfied. Not only the body but also the spirit and magic are completely controlled. The difficulty of maintaining magic is to multiply the magic several times like this. Maintaining a small flame for lighting between the fingers has never been imagined before. Even an intermediate magician can't do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very large room. It is not divided into several rooms like other houses. It looks very empty. The wide room is stacked in the center of the room. There are a lot of books next to two beds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a big deal to find the book and it’s on the table in the middle of the room. It’s so conspicuous that it’s hanging inside the cage. The bait is as invisible to those who come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not move. He now has a 12-point confidence in his feelings. There are absolutely no people or orcs in the ambush within a hundred meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you carefully look at the ground from your feet and look at the table, there are no traps set by any authority. His setting of traps is better than that of first-rate hunters. This is a must-have technique for survival in the wild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully approached and finally saw the location of this institution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the bottom of the book, several lines drawn are mixed with the texture on the desktop. But Asa resolved that the book was pressing on a magical array. This magical array is not large, but the effect from the complex lines and the phosphorescence of the materials used is absolutely not small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be a very effective tool for others, but Asa does not care if he reaches out and grabs the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘噼啪’ The white flash illuminates the house. A few electric lights jumped out of the surrounding air and went to Asa. This is a trap of lightning. Even if one of the most powerful ogres has been subjected to this, it is only on the ground waiting to be pulled away by the dead pig. However, the electric light only flashed to the distance of Asa's body and a half meter, and it disappeared like an ice arrow into the boiling water and disappeared. The robes on his body resonated with the breath on his body, extending the effect that was originally limited to the surface of the body to a place outside the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s income from the book’s voice and light may have alarmed other orcs. He must return to the hotel in the shortest and fastest time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪. Asa was established as if it were petrified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a magical sound but a very rhythmic and very angry applause that is struck together with two palms from the corner on the doorway from. At the same time, there are two breaths of sound that are far-reaching and long, although they are powerful, they have shown signs of ageing. But they are all very organized and soft and smooth, and there is no cramped heartbeat after the suffocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small flamingo flew out of the corner with only half the size of the palms and the wings fluttering in the space inside the house. The torch of the torch ignited and then flew to another torch. Everything in the room is bright and clear, and everything is clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Cedros and General Gru came out of a magical array and stood at the door. This is a magical array drawn in the corner of the door. The position that is standing at the door is invisible. Only by turning around from this house can you see it. This magical array is also very simple. It seems that there is no special effect and magic. It is probably just to isolate the air vibrations in the range, so Asa does not notice any sound...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little flamingo finally ignited the last torch and flew back to the hands of the owner of Cedros to turn into a small flame and then dissipated. This is just the lowest level of fire magic. But even the highest level of magicians in the Magic Academy can't control the mana so freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you must not be a killer, not a thief. Members of the guild will not do it. Just like a cobra will not learn to drill a hole in a mouse." Cedros City looked at Asa. "Do you know? The snake is a snake, no matter how he mixes with the mouse, it can be seen at a glance. You shouldn’t be mixed with the thieves, it will only make you look more conspicuous. Or you should pretend more. You shouldn’t just stand by when you are on a cargo like a hungry dog. When the book is found out, you shouldn’t want to turn your head to the wall. Even the sound of breathing is much thicker. Then you should be more patient and don't panic with the thieves and leave here tomorrow. It takes a few months or a few years to get close to the book. Ask the officials about our residence. It is not very strange that a strange thief suddenly asks for this. This is to tell us that you are coming to visit tonight. So we have to wait here.” The city owner thought and shook his head again. . "In this way, you don't seem to be like the People of the Dead Spirit Guild. Such a rudeness completely loses their usual calm and old-fashioned style. But maybe the times are different. Those guys want to change the taste of doing things to find you. The admission of young people is indeed a very creative change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa has no buzz. He can't say anything without even screaming. The instinct of the beast made him feel the great momentum of General Gru. The effect of meditation makes his consciousness always highly concentrated and highly simple, so that he can fully shed his body's maximum potential. The highly concentrated consciousness has no room to think at all and has not thought about the escape and surrender explanation. As soon as he was a frightened beast, he immediately put himself in a state of nervousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sedros’s black and white radiant eyes staring at Asa’s clothes and hammering Asa’s hammer like a judge’s hammer Identity. "The key is that the robes and the effect that you have on your body are simply your identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city owner turned his head and said to General Gru: " What do you say if you slip into a cobra at home?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kill." General Gru’s answer was very brief and powerful. The silky motion does not seem to be the same as the two powerful words that he uses to oscillate in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preemptive. Asa flew back and flew up a table to the city and the two of them flew to the wide table to completely cut off the line of sight of both sides. Asa rushed forward with the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the table flew on the way, it suddenly stopped and then turned into a balloon and rose upwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of this change, the instinct of the beast is in danger, and the instinct of the whole body is like a blindfolded person feels like he is about to hit the wall and it is still a Block the wall that will crush him. Asa is fully motivated to stop the momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the table flew away from the line of sight, General Gru, who was just standing by the door, suddenly appeared in front of him and reached out to his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hand didn’t hold the fist or grab it. It’s just a very casual gesture like a special extension to let him look at it. Asa saw very clearly that the hand was covered with a haze like a mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no time to dodge the Asa instinctively and know what kind of action to take. His feet are full of strength and fly back. His agility and explosiveness have been several times stronger than in the past. It seems that the movements of the forward and backward movements do not even have a transitional gap even if only the beasts do not react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even then the hand of Gru still touched his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under his concession, this hand didn’t have much power, as if he only pushed him casually, but Asa did not hit it. I stopped on the wall. As soon as he landed, he immediately bowed like a cat. This one of the dodge benefits is no flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good." Gru as a tan ink-like black scorpion shot a stinging light. The original sculptural face began to spur the birth. Like a crazy painter, the autistic musicians have seen a chapter of wonderful music and suddenly found a channel to blame their vitality. Excitement completely ignited his vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the meditation, Asa felt that the robes that were hard to hurt by the original knives were more protective than in the past. The gap between the fibers absorbs some kind of breath from the body and can completely relieve the external damage. But now there are three small points in the chest that are faint and painful. There is also a Chinese food ring finger that has already ooze the blood spot. After the buffer of the robes, it still pokes there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
