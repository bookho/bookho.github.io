			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;斩The Great Sword crossed a whistling fireball, which was divided into two pieces, rolling away from the original track and falling outside the Glorious Castle. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge figure of white is in the midst of a huge meteor like a purgatory. The archangel flies across dozens of fireballs and crosses the giant sword. The huge white area practice constantly disintegrated the cursed fireball. The vast majority of the meteors have been smashed and smashed into the wilderness outside the Glorious Castle to blow up a huge crater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is after all dozens of meteor showers, there are still a few meteors crossing the interception of the archangels, and the pieces of the glorious castle are burning in pieces. The piece of fire. It’s just that within the reach of the Glorious Castle, dozens of fireballs can razed the Glorious Castle to just a few, but only a small part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Glorious Hall, there are still ten templars guarding the pope underneath, but no one has noticed that the pope’s mouth is standing on the top of the main hall. With blood oozing out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the curse of the catastrophe of the end of the world, this angel will smash a gap in the hand with a huge sword in his hand. The castle has a hard way out. The body surrounded by white light is incomparably heroic and there is a huge white light wing. Whether it is majesty or this strength, this is the real salvation emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the people below have no time to watch the fierce scene above. A battle that is bigger and more tragic than before is gradually kicking off in the Glorious Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew was only bowed when the archangel appeared in the meteor shower. But it didn't seem too surprising, but immediately took out a fist-sized blue gem from his waist. This time he didn't throw it out but threw it on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This blue gem is engraved with countless tiny and complex magical runes. A jewel in the ping-pong along the lines of the magical array carved above <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cracked and then a dazzling blue light rushed out from the gemstones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Eye of the Star?" Lancelot exclaimed. He recognized the jewel. The light is the unique magical blue light of space magic. This light is bigger, brighter and purer than the light when the scroll is delivered. The whole shining castle is reflected in the blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eye of the line of stars along the magic rune gradually spreads in the process of crushing into a powder with a slow degree.] /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send the light to condense. A huge blue mirror was gradually formed. This mirror is a circular plane with a diameter of up to 100 meters, such as a <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the strange huge building stands in the middle of the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s ruining that thing." Lancelot screamed almost hysterically and pulled out his long-legged sword. Don't look at him any more and guess what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard this, there is still a timely response. There are only three Knights of the Temple. Wellskai is farthest but it is shot<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fastest running in the moment, standing in the bow and setting a finger, a meter of long steel broken magic arrow The call sign was shot at the eye of the star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Gru is standing by the eye of the star. Wellske’s arrow was fierce and fierce in his eyes. He also reached out with a thrown bamboo stick and grabbed the magic arrow. At the same time, Lancelot even took the sword and rushed straight like a hedgehog with the same sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paladin has not paid the slightest demeanor this time. The Holy Light Cross Sword has been temporarily unable to use the long sword he wielded on his hand. Almost desperately, he struggled against Gru to attack the original steady and heavy. At this time, all of them turned into a fierce fierce and violent. He not only stabbed with a sword. The body slammed over the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glu coldly slammed the sword back. No one can retreat in the face of a master attack like Lancelot and he is not as light in the hard touch with Lancelot. His figure flew more than ten meters with the blade of the storm that Lancero took up and stood up and then boxed out. /<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for Lancelot, this is enough. This is not a duel between the two. He doesn't want to win. What he wants is the short moment that Gru forced to retreat. As long as the other two on the shrine of the Knights, one person holding a sword has already rushed to the eyes of the star before the weapon violently murderous like a gem is to kill the father to win the mother and not to wear the enemy. Wiloskie's arrow and Lancelot's full-scale attack are to give them such an opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately this opportunity is still late. When two weapons have almost been handed to the Eye of the Star, a huge profit has been taken from the blue light<br /> Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The condensed mirror in the gaze stretches out and grabs the two knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of the two knights of the Temple of God is flashing at the same time. This is only a person's size, the claws on the giant claws, the nails are half a meter long, except for <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a horrible giant claw is caught by such a behemoth, even if it has a glorious armor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy but only with the huge power of Bimon It is enough to keep the two bodies together with the weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a flash, but the attack of the two Shrine Knights is only a stagnation and did not give up a shot and a sword sticking out to shoot the star star. Almost at the same time as the giant claws of Bimeng, a tall figure also jumped out of the blue light curtain. This is a Werewolf carrying a huge singular machete in the hands of two muffled werewolves, but the weapons of the two Temple Knights were also smashed. The two other temple knights have not yet reacted. The foot of the werewolf's claws swept four fireballs and attacked the two. This werewolf actually took four rings made of magic jade, which is a high-level magical item similar to the magic wand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple do not hide or let the hands only cover their faces and let the four magics blow on their own body. This low-level magic is in the glory of the armor <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anti-magic power is not worth mentioning, but the fire wave of the fireball explosion still makes the two Knights of the Temple take a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two Knights of the Temple lay down their arms that blocked their faces, they now have no chance. The star has disappeared from the eyes of two huge beimen and several werewolves, and more orcs are coming out of the mirror of the blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few sharp-skinned two-legged dragons actually drew from the huge mirror. The orcs constantly emerged from the mirror, and the mirrors did not have any thickness from the side, but there was already a large group of orcs between them. Each orc was fully armed and screaming and screaming and screaming. The swordsman and the priests rushed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Orphans of the Euclidean Doors actually have such things? But even we have only heard of the notes of the adults of Akibad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of the ancient elves." Stephen Poker in the distance with the huge blue light curtain is so different that he just glanced at it.<br /> Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsurprisingly, I’m faintly saying with a strange tone: “This should be said to be what you expected or if you arrange <br /><br />&nbsp What's the matter?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becaham humbly smiled and said: "That's natural, you don't need to care about Stephen." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, what time do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should be faster? You can be ready to do it." Inham looked up and looked at the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy fire clouds above the high altitude have already poured out. All the meteor showers are dissipating. The meteor fire and the curse have finally been used up.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are great days to use the power to save, but several places of the Glorious Castle have become burning ruins. The huge angel body<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow is blurred too, but he is still buried in the square that is already chaotic, the hundreds of meters tall blue light curtain like a hell <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exit is also broken by the orcs who took the Bimontal dragon and dozens of bulls also flocked under the ride of the half-orcs . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
