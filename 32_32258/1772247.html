			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru regained his position and looked at Asa without saying anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa explained: "This is not my idea of ​​what the court magician and so on. I naturally don't know at all..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru still has no expression or nothing to say but just slowly raises his right hand. The fingers on the right hand are held in a fist and the middle finger is straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa turned his head and rolled his eyes. In this case, everything is said in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short period of silence between the two, Asa asked again: "What are you going to do behind the wall?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which wall?" Shandru glimpsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the face. There is a broken trace on the side that seems to have a lot of magical runes." Asa pointed to the dungeon The wall at the office. There is a shallow sword mark on the wall that Javy once wanted to destroy. In fact, from the beginning, Asa felt the eccentric atmosphere that was faintly scattered there and knew that it must be the one that Jarvi wanted to seek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Sandro now reveals a very surprised look and asks: "Can you see the magic runes above?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course you can see that you can't see it? Or the feeling of being scattered from there... Isn't it very clear?" Asa was somewhat surprised. Although these magical runes are hidden, they are not the illusion of the eyes. And the strange smell that has spread from there has always been a bit of doubt in him. Since Javy had come down early to investigate why there is no such obvious trace, he has to ask himself. I didn’t know why I didn’t expect to see these things in the last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru’s face turned unnaturally without talking and then suddenly reached out and grabbed Asa’s wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s movements don’t seem to be too fast, but Asa’s even the reaction is not caught, and the mediation is a powerful magical power in Asa. The whole body flashed past. Then he inexplicably came up with a sentence: "I wonder how you have the ability to erase the imprints of those vampires alone... originally you have grown up..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After saying this inexplicable words, Sandruh was inexplicably silent. This time, his silence was very deep and deep, and his head was completely buried. Asa could not see any expression on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only Javi’s heavy gasping in the dungeon. Depressed and heavy, no life. Asa suddenly felt a little inexplicably cold. This completely silent Sandro seems to be afraid of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took for the old man to stand up straight and take a sigh of relief. Still reaching out and grabbing Asa's hand, he walked toward the wall. When he walked, he kicked a random kick and Javey slid on the ground and flew out to a corner where he remembered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru stood in front of the wall and stood free between the wall and the gap, but when he was dignified, he finally condensed and finally sighed. Slowly said: "The magic rune above is that I and Ronis worked together to write the well water of the Sun Well and the well water was one of the treasures that I brought out from the Descarte Valley. According to legend, Akibad. What you left behind...when we were writing, I thought that I would never open it again in my lifetime. It’s not open...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I came to stand in front of this wall, he didn’t look at Asa again. It’s a self-talking tone. Then he was silent for a while before looking up and talking to Asa. “But I’m going to show you now. What is inside? Because you have the right to know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait but I don't want to know..." Asa spoke. He always wanted to ask this Javy always wanted to know. What Sandro and Ronnie have been saving here is but now he suddenly feels a strange pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now you have an obligation to know." Sandru did not care that he put his hand on the wall and slowly recited the mantra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless magical runes that slowly separate from the wall, appearing in the air and in the walls. Behind the wall is a small space, but Asa feels that he is standing in front of a dark giant that can swallow the world, but the seemingly non-existent but incomparable rush of breath. It was an endless black that was devoured by the darkness itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Asa came out of the cathedral, it was already dusk. The square was full of priests and magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no big chaos in the Magic Academy. It’s inevitable that everyone will manage everything in a timely manner but there are some turmoil in the hearts of the people. The Cardinal’s sudden disappearance of the Cathedral’s heavy blockade and the transfer of the magical array is really a bit confusing. Fortunately, they didn't know the inside story, so they didn't panic until they couldn't get out of hand. And Wang Duzhong is naturally still in a state of reluctance to be peaceful. The turbulent waves in the palace did not spread to the outside and naturally no one took the initiative to promote the weird changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acceptance of things by people usually has their own psychological boundaries. The Cardinal was actually the Necromancer and the other more powerful Necromancer saved the life of His Majesty the Emperor and Roland and then the murderer who had killed Bishop Ronis and broke the plot to save the Queen. ... This kind of story is definitely out of the limits of acceptance of the vast majority of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, there were a lot of people who saw it all at the time, but those people were not the kind of 'most people'. Under the clarification of the fact that the head of Roland and the prime minister were half-covered and half-story, the old ministers gradually understood and accepted these seemingly ridiculous things. The samurai swordsmen and magicians don't have to worry about a command from the head of Roland, which is enough for them to shut up forever. So the most important thing now is to find a good way to deal with the aftermath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aftermath of this matter is not so easy. The arrested land is the cardinal sent by the Pope, and he is actually from the Descartes. If it is made public, it is more than the direct pooping on the Glorious Castle and others can never believe it. So although the breakdown of the relationship with Celeste is almost inevitable, it still needs to be considered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Asa is not too worried about this. These are handled by someone and he has to deal with him. He came to the crematorium in the corner of the School of Magic. There are already pastors and magicians waiting for him here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dust is dusted back to earth..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three fire magicians are pouring out The flames enveloped Jessica's body and drowned all the outlines in the brilliance. There are also two pastors who use white magic in the cremation table. There is no slight smell in the air. This is the combination of white magic and fire magic. Originally, only the most devout believers and clerics can enjoy it. Cremation treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looks at the flames even if his eyes are not able to see how the body becomes ashes in this bright flame, but he knows that it is dark and healthy. The figure of the earth disappeared from the side forever. When the figure existed, he didn't care much about it but until he lost it, he felt that it was the only warmth of his time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the kind of gentleness that can make people feel impatient and forgetful. It’s just a ignorant childhood. Fantasy. But this kind of emotional indifference may not be emotional at first. Indifference is easy to ignore. Also indifferent and unconsciously will be integrated into your life. When I lost it, I felt that I was missing a piece of my mission. Then I realized that this might be the most real feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa just stared blankly. The grief in the heart is not the kind of heart-breaking pain, but it is a deep undercurrent that flows into the soul somewhere in the deepest part of the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames are gone. The black elf’s once beautiful body has disappeared from the cremation table. It is true that the prayers of the priests just like the priests can only be dusty and dusty. In the end, the feeling of falling out of tears and tears on the magic mask of Asa’s eyes is very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two pastors stepped forward to collect the ashes on the cremation table and did not ask why a Nehran black elf would be cremation here for a few days. There are enough things in the middle school to be weird enough. The great priest has ordered himself to do it honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr? This is..." What a priest had made from the ashes took out a small piece of black gems for Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a round jewel with a thumb-sized crystal clear and slightly strange magical fluctuations. When she cleaned Jessica's body, it didn't seem to be buried somewhere in her body. She never mentioned it. Maybe she didn't want to say that she might not even know it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
