			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not just the gravel that flies in the air of the two people, Roland deLancelot and Talis are all still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the scenes are still their spirits, they can feel the intersection between the real and the virtual. The madness of the life is desperate to devour this dazzling life. This vain filling up and crushing both is constantly killing each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virtual and Real This is no longer the power. This is the most basic two attributes in the world. The aftermath of the collision between the two has shrouded everything around it and can no longer continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s just because the power gap is too big. This is not the pure virtual reality at the beginning of the universe. So it’s impossible to stop even the time. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue light flashed a bit. Moriel’s huge body appeared behind Asa’s only the sacred dragon had enough power to break the influence of this aftermath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mollier is definitely the most powerful presence here. From the perspective of combat effectiveness and strength, she is even much higher than Gru but she has never been hands-on. Unlike Gru, she understands the purpose of her coming here. She is fighting. Regardless of her original temperament and rudeness, the wisdom of human beings and the innumerable combat experience have calmed her down. She has been waiting for the best out of the phone and will no doubt wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge tail swept Asa’s body and flew out like a little straw-filled puppet. The king of the dead, who seems to have completely ignored any attack, is now finally hit like an ordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa flew out at the same time a strange cracking sound also sounded from both his body and Gru's body but no one cares about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How powerful is the power of the Holy Dragon’s full blow? No one knows. I only know that an ordinary black dragon is an ordinary Bimeng who can easily tear a steel doll into pieces. Under the violent blow, Asa’s body suddenly disappeared with the bursting of the surrounding air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not being shattered into powder, but he’s flying too fast, it’s too fast to see the category, even Roland and Lance Lott can't see. But for a short while, he did not reappear in everyone's field of vision and was with Morgan in a kilometer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the flash of blue light, Morrill appeared at a distance of kilometers while the position of flying Asa disappeared. This is no longer moving, moving fast, just moving, can't have such a silent, uninteresting, but more effective than any movement. This is actually an instant movement of space and distance in the sacred dragon. There is no point in front of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of appearance, Morrill’s two claws hit Asa in the air. He stopped him from the invisible horror of the naked eye. The clear cracking of the cloth was uploaded from Asa. Just as Roland was in his shoulder, it was just that the voice was much louder. This is still far from the body of Molly. The muscles of the whole body blue crystal suddenly swelled up and she was trying to tear it to the sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s body is almost completely hidden in the huge contrast of the dragon's claws. He looks weaker and smaller than a leaf. The squeaking sound continued to ring, and the robes of the Ghost King were constantly tearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue flame in the dragon's mouth surged out and drove Moriel's own claws together with the Asa in it, drowning her, but she still felt like this. It is not enough to use all available methods to destroy the enemy in this palm as soon as possible. Her previous calm wait seems to be to save all the attacks and war-torn killings. At this time, all the breath is released. From her shot to the present, it is only a blink of an eye. The situation seems to have turned upside down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue dragon's breath spreads all the stained things on the ground, and even the dragon's claws of the Morial crystal are in this dragon's breath. Slowly deformed, but she didn't mind if she wanted to spray her heart and liver together. She didn't mind to continue to scream at the dragon. The muscles on her arms were getting higher and stronger. Asa, who has been torn from the claws, seems to be ready to scream at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden screaming of a dragonfly is a scream. Moriel's left paw suddenly shattered and the blue flame in her mouth stopped because of screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue flame faded and Asa, who was in the right paw, showed that he had not been smashed or dissolved by the dragon but it looked almost the same. The quaint armor on the body has become a strip of rags hanging on the body and there are traces of burning, even the gown of the ghost king can not afford the blue dragon. The most terrifying thing is that although he still has a hollow look on his face, his body looks like a close-frozen ceramic doll. The skin of the body is covered with cracks. Some of the skin muscles disappear and the bones disappear. The blood is just bloodless. The signs of the outflow and the exposed body are gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that the emptiness to the extreme emptiness to swallow all the emptiness to not blend with the world has been alleviated. Although the black handle's hilt hit Morrie's left-handed sacred crystal dragon's body still can't withstand the power of this destructive artifact, but only the left-handed claw smashed and this smashed illusion did not spread to her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the Dark Star has indeed become weak. It seems that the darkness that can never be shaken finally has dim signs. In the eyes of Roland de Lancelot, the glory of hope emerged. The faces of Talis and Otaru are no longer a piece of wood but they are so excited that they don’t know whether it’s good to be happy or fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mollier’s left paw has collapsed. Asa reversed the hilt and held his right paw and stabbed it. But he couldn't stab because Moryl had already thrown him out and an angry little girl threw the toy in his hand and threw him to the ground without any noise. Under the enormous force of Morial, like a nail inserted into the cream, Asa was directly thrown into the depths of the ground leaving only a small bottomless pit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is far from the end of the screaming remnant. Still in the throat, Morrill’s dragon language magic is beginning to mourn a strange light ball. She formed between her claws. This light ball has no color, not white, not black or gray, but the chaos of numerous energy twists and turns. If the tower master of the two towers of the tooth can see this scene, it will be shocked to close the mouth, which is the original magic energy concentrated to the limit. It is the most powerful and most difficult to control devastating energy legend. Even Akibad can not use this power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Molly's claws raised this group of devastating energy balls and flew directly into the deep pit where Asa fell into the dragon's claws and then raised. Immediately another ball of destruction appeared in her claws, and she roared and threw it again. Raise again and then condense and throw. Just like throwing out nearly ten shots like a cannon, she gasped and stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground trembled for a while until this time she dropped the first ball of destruction that seemed to hit the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an ordinary tremor but a gravel residue. Several people standing on the ground, Lancelot, even Morrison was shocked and stunned as if standing on a ship in a storm. Then the second tremor then let them all jump up and the entire Dragon Desert seemed to have jumped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third time the bang was not trembled or jumped but flew up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at all the deserts, they opened up and turned into countless plates of varying sizes. The dazzling energy flash in the cracks was slightly smaller. A little layer of the stratum is directly rushed by the energy that rushes from below. It is also like the swell of the small boat in the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Booming and banging... bang. The obsidian mountain near here is also collapsing. The power of this attack has even spread to the Shadow Mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deafening noise has broken and cracked. The sky is cut by the energy of the underground forex jetting. The stratigraphic plates that fall down and fall down are huge. The mountain falls and hits the ground on the broken ground. It is shattered and re-thrown. Deep red magma in the ground. It’s raining everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the world seems to be just a moment of any curse in this contrast of power is gentle just spring breeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This long-lasting scene has finally subsided. There is no more energy to shoot from the ground and it is calm. It is not desert here. Many grounds have been completely turned over. The rock formations below are all melted and re-condensed into a strange shape. The south side of the crystal is everywhere. The magma flows everywhere. The heat of the heat that can be cooked by people is full of sulfur smells like the legendary hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where Mollier stood has become a rising mountain. The place where the Asa fell in front of her is already a volcanic crater with a lava. bubble. The blue light around her body began to dim. The crystal on her body gradually fell off and even the blue liquid slowly flowed out of her mouth and nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
