			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to Asa telling how his troops were completely destroyed in the hills, the Cavaliers took a long breath and lowered their heads and fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sits on a velvety soft chair and kneads soft and smooth suede. This kind of thing he had only seen before. The old school in the village has a thin layer in the box used to place the holy book. When he was three years old, he saw an older child just pinching his hand and then the hand was beaten for three days without a spoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This noble and mysterious and dangerous existence is now sitting under the butt and makes him feel a bit strange and a bit enjoyable<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Mulak went to the Imperial City to attend a military conference and went to a young knight who claimed to be the assistant of the Duke to meet him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight’s armor and sword are the most upscale goods. The badge of the Holy Knights above is also seen by his captain. The young and handsome, the mighty and the extraordinary, the noble identity and the temperament that matches it are like the protagonists in the stories that are often heard in the mouth of the bard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This character is actually on an equal footing with himself and immersed in what he reported. Contemplation is still a bit strange and enjoyable. It feels like the chair but magnified a few Times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is only one of you who breaks out and is chased and killed in the lizard swamp and chasing the soldiers." The Cavaliers repeated Asa's remarks. The words are clear and slow and orderly. As if to fear that others could not hear or misunderstood him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nodded: "That's it." The rushing all the way made him very thirsty. He picked up the pot on the table and poured himself a cup of milk tea. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure that you only escaped alone?" The knight frowned and looked at him with a deep, elegant look. Asked. As if this is a very important issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it has been confirmed for a long time, Asa still remembered it carefully and nodded. "Yes. I am alone." This milk tea tastes good. Too small to say that Asa kept drinking and fell down and drank. In fact, he originally wanted to drink at the spout, but the gorgeousness of the Duke's House and the gaze of the opposite knight made him not very interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight stretched his brow slightly and then frowned more hard and asked more seriously: "So who did you say this thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." This Asa is very positive. After coming out of the swamp, he has been non-stop. Even now he has a bandage on his left wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to a few treatment runes and potions in the bag, they were able to walk out of the river and find a dead tree to float to Bracada. The local official knew that the injured daughter was the daughter of the Duke of Mulak and immediately found the priest and doctor in the 50-mile radius. Several ribs on Asa's chest have been attached to the treatment. It doesn't matter, it's just a little fragile. The left wrist was spent too much time and it took a whole day to find a few butchers and tricks to find the bone fragments mixed in the flesh. It’s hard to stun the Asa three times. It’s probably not enough to get back to the original state. The amount of amazing treatment and drug pain is eliminated, but it is also very disappointing. Now Asa has pinned her hopes on the level of the wealthy and priests of the Duke of Mulak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why don't you report the matter to the chief of your army?" The Cavaliers are still very patient and very careful to ask for the slightest details. The candle is in the heart. His focused look is like a child gazing carefully with a little bit of caution as if the thing in front of him suddenly flies away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I don't know exactly who my troops belong to. I just saw that I was recruiting temporary soldiers in Bracada." Asa was here. I also want to ask him who should be looking for more than a dozen copper medals in the past ten days but look at the cup in his hand. It is silver and I am embarrassed to say it. "I asked Miss Xiao Xiao who should report to this. She said that the Duke is a minister of the emperor. I want to report it faster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, that's the way it is. It's great." The knight's brows were very refreshing and relaxed. His smile is as dazzling as the gold on the other side. Most of the girls in their dreams are like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing. The mayor of Brakada used a team to escort her. It would take about twenty days or so to get to the king." Xiaoyan’s cervical vertebrae cracked under the grip of the werewolf and walked out of the swamp. During the process, the bones were slightly deformed due to the injury of the body. The priests of Bracada did not dare to use the treatment to deal with it a little and then use the splint to fix the carriage and slowly return it to the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." The knight nodded. "On behalf of the Duke, I am grateful to you for your heroic rescue of Miss Xiaoxi." He gave a wide-eyed look at Asa and said in his very slow and clear voice: "And you can report this matter directly to the Duke. It’s a very correct choice. I think the Duke of Mulak will know that he will be very happy too.” His blue eyes reveal an expression of incomprehensibility. "Your luck is so good. It's really good." These words are particularly hard to use as if they were lucky for Asa's luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why Asa felt a little uneasy from the Cavaliers’ eyes. It’s not a good faith sign that there is a malicious sneak flashing inside. Asa asks: "What the hell are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The assistant of the Duke of Mulch, the captain of the squadron of the sacred knights of the Baron Carlos. The knight’s vision retracts the sound and smoothness of the voice and these noble titles. "Miss Xiao Xiao's fiance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Asa had some surprises about the Cavaliers' last identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight stood up and his sword brows slightly in his eyes. There was no such thing as a smile on the face, as if this face had never been softened by a smile. Screamed loudly: "Come on. Come down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a dozen fully armed guards appeared in the hall door as if they came out from the ground. Asa is surrounded by groups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa hasn’t caught up with another surprise from the last surprise. Stand up and say: "Is it wrong?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knight's hand knife did not let Asa have any reaction time accurately cut on his neck. On the aorta. Asa immediately fell to the ground like an empty pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bringing into prison and telling you to guard this is an important spy." The knight’s voice is more than his gaze and the deterrent guards are busy with the Asa Go out. "Prepare the horse. Prepare the token. I have an urgent military situation to go to the palace to see the Duke adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very dangerous good luck for the Duke adults. Of course it is also your own. The Cavalier picked up the cup on the table and wanted to drink a cup of tea, but now he got the cup that Asa had just used. Picking up the pot is now empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'When the 骑士Knight dropped the cup and pointed at the velvet chair that Asa had just sat on, he said: "The cup and the chair are thrown away." Added a sentence when leaving the gate. "Don't let me see when I come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s House is not only efficient, but also efficient. It took only ten minutes for the Cavaliers to come to the military conference hall to see the Duke of Mulak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s adult smiled very gently after listening to the brief whisper of the Cavaliers and then said to the ministers at the table in a very gentle tone: “I’m sorry, please. Allow me to leave. It’s a little girl’s business. She was hurting outside.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight in the garden outside the hall told the Duke in detail about Asa’s A word that was stated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke squinted and listened carefully. His eyes are not as big as a glimpse. He seems to be laughing at the neatly splayed character. The flat cheeks of his slightly blessed body feel like a very ordinary middle-aged businessman who believes in being rich and angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Duke’s adult is really dangerous. Fortunately, this soldier is in our hands. Do you think this shows that there is something wrong with them? We Should the Cavalier ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile on the face of the Duke did not detract from the Cavaliers: "I remember you saw them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of person do you think they are?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
