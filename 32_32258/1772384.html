			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed and said: "Itâ€™s not that you can't talk about it. And now even if we all know the truth, it's not a good time. Whether you are going to find Inham or the problem between me and Oufu is a future matter. Now let's talk about the present. You put her first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot hesitated and let go of Ai Mei. "You two, I can put the orcs here, what do you want me to do? Do you use the gryphon to carry them back to Oufu?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You can't move these orc warriors safely out of Celeste. Of course, the hostages in my hands will be with us until we reach the wild land safely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Impossible." Lancelot shook his head. "Even if these orcs march to reach the wilderness from here, it will take at least two or three months. I will never agree to stay in these orphans who are already irrational."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa faintly said: "But are there any better ways than you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You let me go first Make sure these orcs are safe to leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guaranteed? Sorry, Lancelot, I don't believe in these things." Asa smiled and shook his head. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I promise you don't believe it?" Lancelot's face is not very beautiful. The anger on the faces of Talis and the great priest was also heavier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think we might as well take a different angle to think about the problem. It has been no good for either of us to stay deadlocked." Adela suddenly spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean? Let's listen." Asa nodded. "I don't want to hold on to a guy like you in a stalemate. It's not an easy task."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since I know that Sedros is really dead, then I can I will tell you clearly that the life and death of these hundreds of orcs will not be too much in my heart. You really have to insist on letting them go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Isn't it just right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I mean that since Cedros and Gru are not here, these hundred orcs are not worthy of our destruction. So you "You can rest assured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Worth? I don't think that the loss of Lancelot's adult will have any substantial loss to him. It's just that he can't face it. Don't use morals and other things to perfuse me. If I say that these are a robber who has nothing to do with blood, I will believe it. I have already seen too many examples of high-powered people saying that they are not moral. The position is too high. It is normal to hold too many things in your hand."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to admit that what you said makes sense. Only the interests are the most trustworthy." Adela nodded and suddenly lowered his voice to the point where only Asa could hear. "What if I came to give you a promise? I promised in front of all of them in the name of God. Then if I lose the promise of destruction, you should see that it will never be more valuable than killing these hundreds of orcs. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe." Asa thought for a moment and nodded. His identity is still acting as an agent even if he is only an agent. After all, it is also impossible for the Pope to be in this position. Unless he does not even want to do the acting Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But let go of these hundreds of orcs. The leaves of this world tree cannot be given to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa immediately shook his head: "I seem as if you have nothing to do with the world tree leaves. But I need it very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "There is really a need for something that just can't tell you. I can't let you take the leaves of this world tree anyway." Adelaide was savage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I am sorry that this world tree leaf is also a must. Since you have told me your card, I can tell you. Just put it. This world tree leaves returning to the elves, I can not only resolve the mustard between them and Ai Greiner but also have a reliable place for the most reliable allies. You know if someone like me can have a picture The safe haven of whispering can be safer even if you sleep. The elves are stupid and have little flexibility, but they also have little flexibility. Things like morality and belief are more important in their eyes than interests. I am able to recapture them. They are the most loyal allies of my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
