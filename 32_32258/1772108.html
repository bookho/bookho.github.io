			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis went home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is anything in the world that makes him very annoyed and very reluctant to stay, this is definitely one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gate of the Marquis House has a gloomy top and the stains and scars left by the younger months. It seems to be more chilling than when he came back last time. Klauvis walked into this and compared to the magnificent atmosphere of the Duke's House, which is completely disgusting to the extremes of another world. Since he started with the Duke of Mulak three years ago, he has increasingly hated this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also had to come back. Even the deep wisdom, such as the Duke of Mulak, is as good as the head of Roland, but it is hard to find out what clues from the silk lines that fall from the women's clothes. If you can't do it, you can't really do anything. The generals don't know how to kill pig politicians. They don't know how to make bread and trivial things. They have to find people who are good at dealing with trivial things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more intelligent the mind, the more experienced talents are able to get more clues from those lines. So what Kravis needs now is a smart man who knows more about women than a woman in the windy field. He naturally knows where to look for such a person. Although he hates this person, he still comes for the task and work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis saw his father in the living room. He was sullen, but he still performed a courtesy of aristocrats: "Father and grandfather. Please come to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis’ sudden appearance of his son It seems a little pleasant, but the smiling words still make Clausue a bit unbearable: "Don't ask for anything. The mutual perfunctory on the courtesy is free for our two fathers and sons. Your face is clearly two words: hate. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in the face of his son, the Marquis is still so free and easy to pull a chair to Clauses. "Actually, I have already left my friend who has already urging me many times. But here I have some things left for me to deal with it. I want to talk to you before I leave, but I want to let you The thing that comes back to me must be serious or you can talk about it first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this straightforward speech makes Klauvis somewhat annoying, it is no doubt that this is also saved. A lot of time and nonsense time. He sat down on the mahogany chair without a velvet cushion chair and still retains the old-fashioned impression he had when he was a child. And this room floor is all the same as the man he had to show respect in front of him. It is a shameful taste. This kind of unwillingness to make progress is the most hated of him. It is also the shadow of his childhood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two fathers and sons sat face to face on a similar face. The father is casual and lazy. The son is a serious, gloomy and even murderous face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emotions go to the mood work is work. Clause carefully took out a small bag from his arms and opened the few threads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father and grandfather." Clavis tried to control his tongue and said this awkward words. "Please help me to see if I can see something from these lines."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Women's clothes." The Marquis smiled almost I didn’t even look at it, I just knew it by feeling. For the first time in his life, Clavis had hope for this father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis's fingers are very delicate and the skin is more delicate than his son's hand. He picked up the silk lines and gently licked it. He smiled and immediately understood the contents of these little things. "It is the middle-grade goods produced by the Western Tadalia. When the Western business roads have not been opened more than 20 years ago, this is a high-end goods. Because the color is gorgeous, the key is that the nobles are rare. At that time, the noble women can have such a I am proud of a suit of cloth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you see what kind of person is wearing this dress?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I originally wanted to ask if I could narrow down the scope. But when I just exported, even Krauss felt that this was nonsense. To see from these lines, the owner of the original clothes is probably nothing to do with even the legendary prophecy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Marquis did not let his son down. His arrogant look is definitely beyond the reach of any old sorcerer. It is like the Duke of Mulak on power. The head of the delegation said that the sword is not an expert but a sanctification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young.... coquettish...not poor or aristocratic..." It was hard to be surprised by his father's inference. Clovis whispered these characteristics and filtered everything about Asa all over again. The rumors were fixed. "Is it a prostitute?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. That is the niece." The Marquis smiled and affirmed his son's judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis stunned and immediately felt this sentence very strange. But he doesn't know where it is or where it seems that no matter what the angle, this person should not say such a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a matter of fact that the important business has already been finished. Let’s put aside these vulgar things and talk about the problems between our father and son." The Marquis looked at the gentleness gently. Lauves reveals the kindness of a father to his son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I still have a job." Clause replied coldly and stood up to leave. He has always rejected any warmth and feeling that it is a weak person's mind and fighting spirit, not to mention the intimacy expressed by this person. He feels as disgusting as a dead mouse in a garbage dump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis screamed and said faintly: "Sit down. I am not in a hurry at this time. The prostitute can’t run much even if it’s not in the king. It should be easy for you to catch it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis sat down slowly but not because of obedience. His face is full of surprises and looks at his father with a look at a monster that he can't even imagine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going out soon. There are probably a lot of things waiting for me to deal with. I don't know how long it will take. I don't know when I will come back next time. Before, I thought it was necessary for our two fathers and sons to talk about it." The Marquis showed a bit of awkward smile. "From the time you were born to now, we didn't talk about it once."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you have never liked my father. I Understand that I am indeed an incompetent father who only cares about my own arbitrariness and abandons all family members and your mother. As a family member, he ignores the affairs of the family and makes you suffer from being affected by the family. A lot of grievances. The reason why you are so strong and so infatuated is that because of these, it is my responsibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More intense curiosity The heart can't suppress this anger and impatience from the deepest part of the heart. Klaus stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit down." The Marquis looked at him and his voice was not too big, but only slightly brought the majesty of his father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis immediately sat down and sat down. Like a most obedient child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reaction after Clause sat down is inexplicable. He knew that he never wanted to sit down and never sat down to express his submission. But it seems that it has nothing to do with his thoughts but a direct response from the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After realizing this, his shock and incredibleness is increasing. As a warrior, he knows that this kind of physical reaction usually only occurs when the two forces have a huge difference between the two sides. The momentum of one side can completely cover the other side. Just like the tiger can only make the rabbit move with the smell. But in front of it, it’s just a smattering of the color of the hand. But it’s the most magical. If you want to pull the sword right away, you can make him feel different but Clavis looks at his father’s familiar face. Try to find something strange from above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Marquis is still a casual look with a decadent look. He looked at his son and said with a little bit of pain: "You are too young but already Bewildered by the turbid things in this world. Power fame and fortune Do you really understand what these are? Do you really need these things? Do you understand what the world is like? You don’t understand the world in your eyes is Others give it to you. Others envy the power to compete for status and money. You also follow and fight for even faith. All you do is to let others worship you and you are sure. You are living for others. How can life be short? Time is spent on this boring thing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because life is so short in life, you can’t be ignorant of anything that is inexplicable. The work of the world makes everyone in this world of history remember your name." Clovis suddenly slammed the Marquis tone violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the first time in his life to tell his father what he thought. Before that, he felt that there was no need to say this about the unsuccessful saga of such a fascinating dude. He disdains because the other party must not understand that his ambitions are like the locusts that tumbling over the faeces cannot understand the greatness of the eagle overlooking the sacred. But now he must say. Because he felt awkwardly that the ruined man he had been scorning did not seem to be what he thought that the things he showed on him made him seem to be qualified to despise the beliefs enshrined in his heart. Now it is not so much a statement that it is defending its values. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
