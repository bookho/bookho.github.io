			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bells of St. Peter's Basilica penetrated the blockade of the wind and the rain curtain. When passed into the palace, it was already slightly blurred like a dying old man. The court magician who heard this faint sound on a tower in the palace almost jumped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the bell of St. Peter’s Cathedral. They are asking for help... It seems that something happened.” The court magician stood up and ran to the window. To the direction of the cathedral. "And I remember that they didn't seem to have ever played such a thing. It's not too small."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be too small, especially at this time." General Ling also walked to the window and looked at the direction of the cathedral. His eyes, which had nothing to look at, are now full of excitement. "I just hope that I can't think of it as I really thought..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does the Bishop of Escher really..." The court magician thought I want to shake my head and smile. "I can't believe it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, according to the reason, I don't believe it myself. But things don't happen, we don't believe it. Decided..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the assassin really killed the Bishop of Ascher..." The court magician cautiously said as if he was afraid to say it out loud. It will make this disappear. "We may really want to thank him for being..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ou Ling nodded and coughed a little. "That is of course, I will go to him now and thank him for going with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court magician asked: "How are you going to thank this for help?" "We have a local person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it is to cut his head." Ou Ling faintly answered. He pulled out the long sword from the waist and the faint magic runes emerged from the sword. And the leather armor on his body began to show the same magic runes. "If he has the ability to cut the head of the Bishop of Ascher, there will be the ability to cut off the head of anyone in Erasia. It is very dangerous to keep such a person."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If he really has the ability to kill Ascur... Do you think we can deal with it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Assassination Fighting with the front is always two different things and as long as the Bishop of Ascher or his guards are not so pussy, let the assassin retreat without damage. The key is now that he is a prey. We are hunters." The general looked at the court magician. "It seems that it is too late to dispatch a large-scale search." To deal with such a master, it is inconvenient. Can you find out the trace of the guy in such a storm?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wind and rain are too big. The other party must be a hidden stealth master. This is Wangcheng. There are too many people. It may be a little difficult..." The court magician looked at the towering rain outside the tower and hesitated to answer. "About 100 meters, my magical eyes can only guarantee that he will never be missed within 100 meters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good within 100 meters. General O'Ling nodded no more than the magician turned over and jumped off the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court magician closed his eyes and whispered the curse. Numerous blue magic symbols spilled from his body and then gathered magical symbols on his head. It became a huge eye shape. This magical eyeball with his head's head swayed and swayed through the faint pupils of blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician then mourns a large spell and makes complex gestures. The body slowly floats up. He added a few magic shields to himself and flew out of the tower. The huge eyeball above his head was only slightly paused. Follow the direction of Ou Ling, who has long since disappeared into the wind and rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure at the top of St. Peter's Basilica stood on the cross at the top of the church and waited quietly for the next time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden ground has been soaked in rain on the forehead cheeks and the armor on the rain like a waterfall from the head and neck into the armor has been soaked in the rain. Her hand was placed on her eyebrow to cover the rain and watched the darkness of the wind and rain. She did not move from beginning to end like a statue cast on the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Peter's Cathedral is the highest building in the kingdom. The top of the building is also the closest to the sky. There is no other reason why a person has the courage to stand in this place at this time, except for finding death. The power of thunder in the sky is far from being comparable to the lightning in the hands of magicians. Even a protective lightning released by an air master. In the face of the day, there is not much paper in front of a piece of paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, she knows that the glorious armor of her body can't resist the thunder that can fall on his head at any time. As long as the lightning falls on his head, it will become a coke in a glorious battle armor. But she doesn't care that she only knows she has to wait. And it is necessary to wait until she sees the man who fled. The faint radiance of the Glorious Battlegear is like a negligible firefly in the night that devours everything, but no matter how hard the wind and the night are, the black light is thundered and the lightning is violent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few white lights walking in the streets. The guards in the church have already made a few batches to chase them out. The light is that the priests in the team have white Illumination maintained by magic. It is impossible to use any light to illuminate in such heavy rain. The Knights of the Kingdom who heard the bells should also be coming here. However, in such a large wind and rain, the large-scale pursuit will not have much effect. The rain is so big that even the eyes of the people cannot be opened. Even if it is opened, it can be seen only a few meters away, not to mention the high rain in such a bright future. There is no difference between the search and the futile in the tracking of the master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pale lightning bolt pulled the dark night for a moment. Then the dull thunder echoed above St. Peter's Basilica. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is happening, but Talis hasn’t even blinked, just keep this position and change direction. She didn't feel scared of anxiety or any other emotional fluctuations. Now there is only one thought that fills her chest. It is to find the person to catch the eyes with high-level eagle eye and reconnaissance. It is full of bloodshot magic and The ray of extreme anger is mixed with light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is angry. She is not willing to be more incomprehensible because she clearly saw that the man was a sword and the head of the cardinal was actually the Abin. The one she always believed in was very good and could even be called the first friend of her life. She can't accept this reality. She believes that all this is the manipulation of this person. It is only the way to catch this culprits that interpretation is the solution to all of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with the sound of tearing the human ear together, a louder and brighter lightning crossed the sky. For a moment, this deadly king city seems to have returned to the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis's nephew suddenly narrowed down at this moment she finally saw it. A figure is in the middle of the street about two or three miles away. Stumbled but quickly ran towards the distance. Like a cheetah, she finally showed her long-awaited prey. She rushed to the eaves and flew up from the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dull bang. Water splashes and stone chips fly. Even if there is a feather drop to cushion the impact of the nearly 100 meters, it is also a huge hole in the bluestone floor where Talis landed. She stood up and felt that her bones and internal organs seemed to have turned into a throat and had a silky smell. But she did not have the slightest pause to reach out and use her own treatment to fly in the direction she saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain is so big that some people use the basin to pour water down on the top, and the eyes in the rain can't open a mouth is a mouthful of rain. As soon as you breathe, there will be water rushing into the nose. Standing in the rain is like standing in the water, the wind is also very slim, and people in this wind are standing still in the wind. The raindrops are driven by the wind like countless small fists and slaps on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very black except for the occasional lightning with thunder, the sky was shining brightly and the whole king city was black. Everything in the sky is like nothing except the sound of the wind and the thunder, and there is no light or no anger. Even the alarm bells of the cathedral have been completely lost in the wind and rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa didn’t know that he couldn’t feel the amazing weather around him. The rain didn’t get into the nose and the lungs couldn’t feel like running. The old man who coughed like a 50-year-old lung disease didn't even feel that he slipped and fell again and again. He is now like a dog who has been stabbed and stabbed and then interrupted a leg. He twisted and rolled and crawled in the rain to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running. Asa now only knows to run. But he didn't even know where he should run and how to run. It seems that someone has poured a boiling lead juice into the brain. All the consciousness is vague and chaotic. It is very hot and tumbling. He seems to feel that his brain is being stirred into a pot of bean dregs by his own thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the mental power of Escher’s death in his mind is long gone, but in his encirclement, he not only has his own magical spells Release more murderous. The masters who are present are no matter how astounding and magical the bluffing meditation is, how amazing and lifeless, there is no murderousness. There is no such thing as the slightest pressure of a tiger, but it is like a tiger screaming but not seeing the minions. That is a proof of bluff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
