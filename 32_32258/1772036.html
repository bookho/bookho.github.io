			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old man in a room full of various corpses turned his head and turned to look at Asa’s remorse: "I am early It’s strange how the skinny monkey suddenly remembered the door-to-door delivery and didn’t bargain. I knew that there was no good bargain.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa wants to get up The hand just had a thorn in the chest on the ground, and the tingling of the heart screamed and screamed to the ground. The ribs that were broken off on the ground were so intertwined that he could not even speak. The old man ignored him and whispered to himself while playing with his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a few breaths, Asa struggled to swing his head and look around. This is a large room or a large house. The structure is very simple and very high. The roof is very wide. The wide door has four large walls and a large glass window to make the room look bright. Every corpse inside can be seen clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is not very accurate because there are dozens of incomplete corpses in addition to a dozen complete corpses and countless bubbles in the glass bottles. Placed on shelves and countertops of varying heights. This house is completely a humanoid exhibition hall. Asa was lying in a man's naked body and surrounded by a few hands and feet. The old man was smashing a female body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a footstep, the wide wooden door was ringing and there was a voice shouting outside: "Sandra’s old man is not there? Open the door." The old man shouted: "I am going to come in and open myself." The door pushed open a dozen fully armed soldiers and came in. Several of them saw the setting of the pendulum inside and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small captain asked the old man: "Do you have any other people here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Man?” The old man named Sandu nodded. “All the people here are people who want to find them themselves.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I am Q, have you seen suspicious living people you haven't seen before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven't seen this before, I haven't seen it yet." Pointed at several soldiers. The soldiers looked at their fingers and twisted their faces. It was just the blood and other liquids that had just been drawn from the belly of the woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This old man is like this. Today, a prisoner ran from the prison in the city. It was a very fierce scam and killed all the people in the prison. The corpses are often sold to your fat and thin people. The prisoners are still hiding in the city and we are instructed to search." The captain said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The spy has never seen anyone here and you have to search for it." The old man of Sandru re-emerges and confuses the body<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone is searching carefully everywhere. Remember that a man of about twenty years old has a slightly darker black eye and a left hand injury. Also remember to speak to him immediately. Ge kill. This is the order of the Duke of Mulak. I want to come here. This guy may also point to the sorcerer and raise some gods." The captain of the wind and the underground commanded the soldiers to spread the search slowly and several times, and they were still concentrating on the spot. Feeling spit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order of the Duke of Mulak? Asa did not speak but heard clearly. Although he did not know how to kill all the people in the prison and then fled here. But the ‘I’m not going to talk right now’, he also heard it very clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to do this now is to close your eyes and continue to pretend to wait until the crisis is over. But the bad luck is that the light in this room is very visible and includes the bandage on his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, let's see." The old man of Sandro pulled out something from the abdominal cavity of the woman's body and smugly grabbed a terrific one. In my hand, I showed that "I dare to bet that this woman has not given birth but has had a baby. Some people in Wangcheng have done this kind of thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Wow-'' Vomiting - 'The two soldiers next to the captain finally couldn’t help but vomit. The voice seemed to be contagious and several other soldiers vomited one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fuck - who *** brought the recruits?" The captain's boots were covered with vomit and jumped up. Look at the other soldiers 6 continue to vomit themselves and then look at the things held by the old man in the hands of Sandro, there are several ribs attached to the female body. A disgusting scream: "Receive the team and hurry and go quickly." The soldiers immediately ran out like a flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa only saw that this was a tall, tall man with a dirty monk robes that could not see the color. Because the gray beard head and the silk of the robes are entangled, he can only see his facial features in a limited space. The only thing I can see clearly is that the eyes are black and white and there is no trace of sluggishness that he should have at this age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what's going on. You know why they are looking for me, why don't you hand me over to them?" Asa asked weakly. Every broken bone that says a word chest is whining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru’s old man narrowed his eyes and asked for a natural tone: “Why should you hand them over to you?” He lifted five fingers and shook. "You can value my five bronzes. Five 哎."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you have a chance to escape, I will pay you back." Asa is completely in front of him. Overwhelmed. The injury with such a heavy injury on his body was inexplicably a wanted criminal and the ‘no need to speak immediately to kill the ground’ command gave him no chance to defend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't look like you have no chance to go out of town. I can also search here. Maybe the women's toilet in the city has already been searched. What have you done? "The old man asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just saved the Duke’s daughter from the swamp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then by the way Did she get out of bed? Give birth to a child? Or sell it to a brothel? Give it to a slave trader?" The old man's association is very rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the way to Bracada."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Duke’s way of thanking is really Special.” Shandrew’s old man shook his head. “But there is no reason why I am not interested. There is just a shortage of people to work for debt. Anyway, you can’t run. If you don’t catch it, you won’t relax. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa had a good time to answer and said, "It seems that this is the only way. Just ask you to find a doctor's pastor first." "Because of the pain, his voice has begun to blur." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru old man looked at his hand and touched his hand on Asa’s chest and suddenly grabbed the ribs on both sides. Asa yelled and felt that the chest was stuffed with a few knives and it was almost fainted. When he sighed a little and then awake, the bones that had been broken were not even badly connected, and even the pain was almost gone. More than a dozen pastors in Bracada were busy with the treatment that was completed in the morning. The old man seemed to be just a juggling act. Although Asa is not very clear about magic, he probably guessed that this is a very high level of healing spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three months," said the old man of Sandru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Asa didn't know what the old man meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take you a cure, you have to do it for me for three months."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa quickly lifted the left wrist that was smashed by the werewolf and asked, "What about this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru old man untied the bandage and looked carefully A sigh of picking money on the side of the road: "At least three years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of the Duke of Mulch, the Duke of the Duke’s study, frowned slightly There is no harvest report from the Wangdu Guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers knight stood straight ahead. Even in this angry mood, he did not have the slightest gaffe. It is still so powerful and extraordinary that he has justified the concept of ‘Knight’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he looked down at the floor and looked at his anger from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke did not blame his Duke for never blaming anyone and not tempering anyone. It is only that Klauvis can't forgive himself for committing such a big mistake. This mistake may lead to the failure of the entire plan and even the safety of the Duke and himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke suddenly asked: "Why should all the people in the prison be killed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawrence replied: "I am afraid that the soldier leaked something inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
