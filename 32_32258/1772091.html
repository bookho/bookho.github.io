			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nights of the wilderness are always very quiet. Only the occasional two-legged dragon's cry echoed in the night sky, but the soldiers were used to it. Since leaving Bracada, this huge beast has been hovering over the sky above them. At first, the soldiers couldn't help but use the bow and arrow to try to attack. But the height and the airflow of the Wyvern's wings shook all the long-range attacks and could only fall back to the ground and cause companion injuries from time to time. The orcs obviously cherish this precious creature and refuse to rush to attack it. At the camp of this night, there were always dozens of soldiers armed with strong bows, guarding the sneak attack of the Wyvern in the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several werewolves moved toward the camp by night. Even on a quiet night, their approach does not make a sound, and they don't need any illumination. Even in such a dark night without moonlight, you can see things clearly so you can see no sound and light. . This is an ability that humans can't match to make them a great sneak attacker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers on the edge of the camp and even without patrols are quietly surprised. The werewolf quietly approached the edge of the camp. Of course, in such a small amount they will not cause any effective harm. This is just a test and harassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly a strange buzz came out of the camp. It seems like the sound of an animal. Several werewolves haven't reacted yet. The entire barracks have been activated by this voice. The torches lit up and the soldiers flocked out of the camp. Just now, the soldiers barracked and slammed into the ocean, and the soldiers rushed over to the werewolves. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers did not have any sergeant to come out and command and command was completely rushed out of the arms with the arrogance of the street. It is not discipline that directs them but emotions of anger and hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two foremost soldiers immediately became the victims of the meteor hammer in the hands of the werewolf. The broken body flew out of the blood and splashed around. But the soldiers who had the blood of their companions did not show the slightest hesitation and timidity, but rushed forward more bravely. The screaming in their mouths was not like a human being but a bloody beast. Those eyes covered with bloodshot eyes under the torch are all signs of crazy fighting spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several werewolves were frightened by such scenes. They began to turn and flee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large body in the soldier group rushed to the side of a werewolf with a few arrows that were not commensurate with the body, holding a huge axe toward the werewolf Cut the past. This huge axe, which is almost as tall as a werewolf, shows the extraordinary lethality of the Weaver's Meteor Hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolfman turned dangerously and evaded the meteor hammer in his hand and waved at the attacker this weapon that could smash the shield armor and another in the hands of this man Touch the axe together and make a loud noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other axe that the werewolf smashed out of the horror has already recovered the arm of the werewolf’s weapon with the powerful arm and skill of the user. The whole was cut down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the wolf's empty hand gripped a piece of flesh on the opponent's body. It was just that the soldiers around the pauses had come up. The werewolves only had time to kill two or three soldiers with their claws and teeth, and they were smashed by countless swords and spears around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other few werewolves have begun to turn and flee. The upper body of the man who had just cut down the werewolf has been soaked by blood. If it is not experienced and timely evaded, this claw is enough to open him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This long-lost injury and the leak of the battle made his fighting spirit completely burned. He screamed forward and took a step to throw the giant axe in his hand. The axe screamed in the air and chased the werewolf who fled in front. A wailing that the werewolf fell. The other werewolves quickly disappeared into the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa came out of the camp and saw the high morale soldiers surrounded by the generals. The blood of the whole body did not make the generals have the slightest sorrow and disappointment, but it was even more spirited. This battle gave him fresh vitality. He saw Asa pointing to a few small animals pointing at the corner of the camp and laughing: "Thank you for your idea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are rats A herbivorous small animal on the wasteland of rabbits is particularly sensitive to smell. When Bracada and the generals discussed the wilderness, Asa once told the generals how to capture these sensitive small animals in the camp. They only had to smell the unique stench of carnivores. sound. This method was originally used by adventurers when they were resting in the place where the beasts were infested. Asa turned around and it was really effective to think of the silent sneak attack against the werewolf. The general had already let all the soldiers take their weapons to sleep. As soon as they heard the pups of the pika, they immediately went up and killed the sneak attackers. This arrangement did have a huge impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One person knocked down two werewolf generals in the eyes of these young soldiers is the embodiment of the god of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers looked around the general to see him pouring the shochu into his wound. On the full muscles, the wounds were deep and the generals used needlework to connect the meat on both sides. He pierced his own flesh into the flesh and pulled it out of the wound and pricked it in and tightened the line. The fleshy meat is squeezed together under the wire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general’s face is quiet and calm, like sewing clothes. Most of the young soldiers were on the battlefield for the first time to see such a scene revered for the generals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stood by and watched him not go to the generals to use healing. He didn't want to help him. He wouldn't want to die soon. Moreover, he also saw that such a heroic performance of the general was originally a way to motivate the morale of these young soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals finished the soldiers and they all went back to take a rest. After this time, there should be no more sneak attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa did not leave the soldiers and left there and he and the dying werewolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to see this werewolf here only he is not hostile to these orcs. When I was in Oufu, I used to see these orcs and people working with tools to live a life. So in his eyes, they are not very different from people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the point of view of physique, this should only be a wolf who did not grow up completely, and even the white fluff on his body did not completely fade. If converted into * humans, probably still Just a teenager. The general's axe left a very deep wound on his back. The broken ribs were clearly visible from the wound. If there was not a hard leather armor on his back, he had already ordered his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The werewolf has been tied up by the soldiers with ropes, but even if he doesn't, he has no room to struggle. His face like a wolf or a dog looked very weak and his eyes were half-lost and half-dead. He looked at Asa’s eyes and suddenly his tears came out. His young age made him look weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were poets who sang tears as a special product of human beings but those who knew about animals knew that this was not the case. Although Asa never felt that this kind of thing has a special noble meaning, but there is still a strange feeling in seeing the tears of this werewolf. He leaned down and reached for a treatment on the wolf's wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because my heart always thinks about going out to travel, so during his time in Bracada, he will have time to study various spells and ask for his skills. Pastors. Although the prayers of various cumbersome spells of auxiliary blessings are hard to remember, the effective spells of healing and detoxification are very advanced. Probably the power of the world's tree leaves and the sun's well in the body is also very beneficial to the magic. Although his treatment is not as good as the old man of Sandu, but it is much higher than the average pastor. Once used, the Werewolf's wound immediately stopped the blood and even healed a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." The spirit of the werewolf was better, said in a vague voice. These young orcs are generally trying to learn human language. I was surprised to see that this little werewolf was also helped by this kind of unexpected help. "Please let me go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa made a helpless gesture and said, "That can't let you go, they will treat me as a traitor." Maybe the crazy old man is looking for my handle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to die." The little werewolf's expression twitched like an injury. The dog snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having listened to this sentence, it seems that some familiar pleading for Asa’s heart moved. But he also knows that he can't put this werewolf. "In fact, you really shouldn't come to attack." Compassion makes Asa feel a bit awkward. It is because of his proposal that the general can easily defeat the sneak attack of the wolves. If, according to common sense, it is really necessary to guard against the sneak attack of the orc like the werewolf, it will be extremely labor-intensive and morale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of the werewolf recovered from the weird tone of the werewolf. "We are not a sneak attack, just to investigate General Gru to find out the purpose of your army." And the intention" can be seen that this is just a very smart little werewolf who does not seem to be very hard to talk about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intentional purpose? It should be said that it is to go to the Oufu or to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa almost can predict the consequences of this army’s encounter with the orc troops led by General Gru. Only by the strength of General Gru, of course, it is impossible to resist all the five thousand soldiers here. But it is not difficult to directly rush into the army and to unscrew the general's avatar apple or pinch like a tomato. . Soldiers who lost their commanders and spiritual leaders will witness the disparity of strength. No matter how high morale they will, they will immediately collapse and then they will be allowed to be slaughtered by the orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as for how to solve the current situation, Asa still can't think of any way. Only when the army advances, I hope that the car will have its own way to the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the little werewolf in front of him. How will the generals take this prisoner? When the two armies confronted each other, they used to kill Liwei? In fact, he is as innocent as the five thousand soldiers. Asa patted the werewolf's head and said, "I try not to let them kill you. This battle is actually not your business."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small The werewolf looked at Asa and nodded and said, "Thank you for your help. The Lord of the City said that he would have to talk to him immediately after the peace talks. You don't have to fight. Please come to Oufu"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly heard such a naive invitation to Asa could not help but a little want to laugh, he suddenly had the idea to save him. He patted the werewolf's head and said, "Reassured, I will bring you back to Oufu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little werewolf whispered in two eyes. There is a little tear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa got up and walked back to his camp to sleep. He suddenly felt that it was always good to be able to die less innocent people with the troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was stunned by the noise of the outside, and it was already dawning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers are ready to go out. They are concentrating on one command to listen to the general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa went over and was surprised that the general was standing next to the injured werewolf, one foot on the werewolf’s head, and the mighty pointing at the ground was tied The orc captive shouted: "Everyone has seen these beasts who have maimed our compatriots and are not worthy of fear. Because we have the courage to be incomparable and the justice of revenge for our compatriots."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers returned a shout of screaming. Although the methods are not the same, the generals will carry out such incentives every day to prevent the flames of revenge from extinguishing in the bodies of these soldiers to ensure that they are mad at the fighting spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general continued to speak: "The orc's lair is very close and will soon be ruined like a bed bug. All the orcs will be there. We are dying under the sword of our righteousness. Now we will kill the warriors and all the warriors will cut him and use his blood to wash our swords."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The soldiers are another scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, etc." Asa did not expect that the general would take this prisoner this morning and rush to the front to stop. "This prisoner has no resistance. You are not a warrior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go away." The general waved his axe in a powerful manner. "You are a weak cleric. You think we don't know. You are also influenced by the aristocratic powers who want to soften our warriors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa Knowing that it was useless to say anything to the general, he turned his head and shouted at the soldiers: "This wolf is not as old as five or six years old. It has not been possible to ruin humans. Those who have eaten people have not been killed. "We don't have to do this anymore"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do these savage races owe blood debts because they are dead? Are those killed by them? Is the hatred of the compatriots eaten like this?” The general’s waving expression on the face of the arm made every soldier feel the sound and momentum even if he could not see it clearly. "Everyone said that I can't do this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" The high and fierce echoes of the generals echoed Asa and felt that he was being shouted around. The sound was soaked and drowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little werewolf on the ground struggled desperately. He could hear that he was probably unable to escape, but the ropes were so strong that he could only pulsate in vain on the ground. There was a sudden low snoring in the werewolf's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the deafening shouts of the soldiers around, Asa still listened to the voice of the werewolf very clearly and understood that it was the survival of the ** and the animal nature in the desperate The sound of the out. At this moment, he actually had another illusion of lying on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general’s huge axe waved with a mission-like voice like a historical mission: “killed it.” The soldiers shouted and started Flocked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screaming screams of the werewolf screamed in the sound of the broken bones of the bones. It seemed that it was the direct sorrow of Asa, which suddenly had a layer of goose bumps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa has been squeezed out and can’t see how the werewolves in the crowd are being separated. Only blood and tiny fur pieces are seen with the soldiers. The waving of the weapons on hand kept flying upwards and then spilled onto them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably because of the strong physical strength of the werewolf, the werewolf did not die for a while. The tragic sound continued to weaken after a while and gradually disappeared without any sound. But the soldiers were still continually rushing to slash and smash the smashing sound of the meat sauce. There was no pause. The soldiers rushed to the front of the team and rushed to the flesh. The sword seems to be participating in a long-awaited sacred ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a while, this grand ceremony was completed and the soldiers were included in the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werewolf is no longer on the ground, a large pool of deep red mud, like garbage, except for some of the larger bones, the traces of some cubs People will never see what it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers waved the weapons with these crimson objects. Many people still have blood on their faces, but all of them are all impassioned like those red. Something is the loyalty and heroic token of the Medal of Honor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers are calling for pleasure. They are very clear that it is a virtue to excite themselves. Killing the enemy's alien enemies is the noble character of loving the family and loving the nation. This original collective fanaticism and the full affirmation of their own values ​​complement each other and make morale infinitely high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked at the soldiers in front of him. He now understands how innocent he really wants to save them. But they don't really need to be more willing to do more things themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not angry or sad. Looking at the bloody broken limbs over there, he only felt sick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general is still not moving as the same sculpture looks down on everything that is in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa silently turned around and took a horse to the horse and turned the horse head toward Bracada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong? You are not here waiting for me to die? No matter what I am leading them to do?" The general finally opened his eyes and there was victory. The taste of the person. He can see how this young man is going back. Finally, I was scared to run out of this nasty kid general to be proud of the glorious cause of this glorious career. This is the case of war wars and these are just a little bit of a piece of cake and a small one is not worth mentioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eastern sun has risen to the red. According to the early morning sunshine, Asa only felt that his blood was burning. He turned his head and stared at the fanatical leader and his five thousand supporters. He shook his head and said, "I will die if you die." No.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city hall of the city hall of the city of Oufucheng is standing and reviewing the documents of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oufu City continues to expand the population and constantly increase the number of foreign orcs constantly joining how to better manage the attitude of the country to the empire His mind came to straighten out the analysis of the thousands of relationships to come up with the most effective and best solution for one stone or two birds. The city of Cedros has been sleeping for three hours a day during this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the old man who is over the ages is still so full of spirits and he has always kept his work like this to concentrate more spirits. Because he is not finishing his work but enjoying his work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that every time he completes a job, he knows that Oufu’s own city is more powerful and perfect. The joy and satisfaction that I kept getting from it and the gratification gave him a new vitality and new life. In fact, in his eyes, these things are definitely not ‘work’. They must be classified more like ‘games’. He is as happy as a child who creates a clay castle with his heart. He is more serious. He has earnestly worked hard to achieve a million times of achievement. The project itself is even more numerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps outside the door sounded. Cedrus frowned and knew it was a bit of a hassle. He could hear that it was the footsteps of General Gru and that there was not much that he could make his friend seem to be in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
