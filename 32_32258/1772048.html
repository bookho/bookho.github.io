			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As a knight, you should fight the enemy through the front to win the victory. Any other means of turning around is an insult to your character and the knighthood. "Rodhardt's face showed a heroic expression. "But tactically, I am afraid that they will use the imperial adults directly to marry us, so it seems that they should be secretly touched. What do you say should be done?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What do you want to do if you want to do it." Asa’s answer was straightforward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to preserve my identity as a knight and want to complete the task perfectly. I must find a perfect way." He thought hard with his head. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I chose to sneak into. We are not against the rules of the Cavaliers, but more cherish life." Rodhart finally found a two The reason for the method is arbitrarily determined by the tactics and he is more able to find this method to be proud of himself. "I have a deeper understanding of the Knights Road now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He brought Asa to the place where the day was said to have been an accident. This is a shortcut in the middle of a shrub land that is naturally trampled by horse-drawn carriages and people. This kind of environment is really suitable for the thieves. The imperial minister dares to take only two or three followers to go there and apparently overestimates the local public order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt looked around the environment and said: "The blessings of the old days are not raining. The local officials are afraid of fighting the grass and causing the death of the imperial minister. Send someone to search," he said proudly. "Now I can find the traces of these thieves by using the tracking method I learned at school."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He bent down and began to look closely at the ground and the grass. After a while, he stood up with a sore waist and said with amazement: "There is no trace of the traces. The soldiers in the city hall actually collected my money and lied to me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is only a dozen here and there is no horse riding is to take the imperial minister away." Asa has already appeared on the ground footprints and traces of weeds. "Follow me." Asa drilled deep into the woodland, Rod Hart hurriedly followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the woods, Asa almost found the traces of the thieves all the way without any effort. This kind of thing is too simple for someone who once played a chase game in the most dangerous no man's land area and a werewolf. These traces are almost as obvious in the eyes of Asa as they are placed there. He jumped and ran in the woods and ran like an animal in his own territory. Rodehart was wearing a steel armor to follow him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa suddenly stopped and reached out and followed Rod Hart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four seemingly natural tree vines extend from under the four trees to the top of the tree and are inconspicuous in other natural tree vines. This trap is quite adequate and it is obvious that the traps used to capture animals are not so concealed and will not be placed where they have ever walked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a mechanism for pulling traps that are not dead. This kind of trap that can't kill people immediately is usually not too big for people. As long as there are things like knives, they won't be really trapped for a long time. That is to say, there must be something like an alarm bell on this trap to inform the person who set the trap to arrest it. Therefore, it is certainly not far from the thief's lair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa said to Rodhart: "Take your armor off that is too bulky to run fast."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt shook his head and said, "No, this is the sign of the knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you follow me and follow If you don't go, you will try to delay the thief who came here as far as possible." Asa is such a person who is in trouble and does not want to pay attention to him. According to his skill, it is not a problem to deal with a dozen thieves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa picked up a large dead branch on the ground and threw it away from a pile of weeds in front. A loud net slammed from the dead leaves of the underground weeds and gathered around the top of the tree while faintly screaming in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa immediately identified the direction and distance of the sound. He flew out to the side to prepare to circumvent the thief who came in and sneak into the thief's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Asa saw a few simple turfs on the front of the forest glade. There were several bonfires on the trees and several wooden houses. This should be the camp for thieves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just such a simple nest. These thieves are not professional enough to look more like a group of temporary rabble. He already has plans to sneak into it and rush into it one by one. Across the tree weeds, I was able to see a few figures, Asa rushed out of the bush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he immediately did not know which one he should go first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few old people holding wood look at him slyly. These old people’s clothes have been difficult to cover their entire body. The wrinkles on their faces are full of suffering. They have been humped and can’t be straightened. They stand there and they don’t seem to need to fight again. They will fall down at any time. . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several children with a runny nose looked at the tree house and shouted. Several of them were wearing bark and some were still full of body. One of them was still peeing to see him daring out of the bushes and screaming at the mouth of his mouth. He was so eager to make a shot that was not as good as he expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the child’s yelling A dozen women came out of the straw shed and the tree house and held the animal skin. They saw that Asa was not afraid but only showed a surprised look and one of them came over. This is a middle-aged woman's clothes. It is a relatively complete head. With a bunch of grasshoppers, the simple and honest face of rural women in the back of the brain has some smart and capable temperament, which is probably the leader of women. She came over and asked Asa: "Are you young people who touched the alarm bell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah." Asa answered slyly. He now has no idea how to react. It is impossible to rush into this group of elderly and children and women as expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women looked at Asa and asked, "Are you lost your way? You don't seem to be a local. Is it a wanderer from outside?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." Asa nodded and nodded. The knife was hidden on his back and hidden under the robes. He still wore the old robes that Sandu gave him. As for the head beard and face, he couldn’t see it. He never looked at it and would not be like a person with status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hungry? Don't go into the house and have a warm soup." Women show the hospitality of the rural poor. "My husband went out and checked the trap that you touched. It was only used to deal with the soldiers. It will come back soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not in this woods In the depths of the city, it’s just a small village. Asa remembered that Rod Hart still stayed there. When he meets a woman's husband, a group of people will definitely fight. The knight's steel armor and sword will make it clear that it is to rescue the imperial concubine. He turned and walked to the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a few steps away, I saw more than twenty men coming over. Only the two of the men holding the shortswords and bows were the farm tools with the pitchfork and the hoe. Rodhart was surrounded by people in the crowd and talked to the men next to him. He saw Asa waving his hand and waving his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they approached Asa and stared at Rodhart, "What is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhart laughed like a child: "Misunderly misunderstood these are the folks in several villages near me. I haven't seen them for several years. This is the hunter Levin. This is Bombo. Big Brother squatted and introduced the man next to him like a prodigal son who had just returned to his hometown with a friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit around the campfire for a while to know that they are villagers in nearby villages. Because they couldn't stand the tax increase that has suddenly increased in recent months, they fled into the mountains to hunt and occasionally rob the passers-by of their lives. Yesterday they saw a gorgeous man in the forest and a few followers thought that just the average rich man would go up and tie him back. I know that it was the imperial minister sent by the king who made the local officials in the city like the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It must be absolutely impossible to put people in abduction of the court minister." Rodhart advised everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No." Someone immediately objected. Asa remembers that this is a man named Robbong who was introduced by Rod Hart. It’s a bald-headed fat man with a face full of flesh. It’s hard to see the traces of the poorness from the fat on his face. I just heard that the fat that he had accumulated before was probably entrenched in the body and he’s hard to bear. Difficulties even if you starve to death will not change your body shape. He first stood up and said, "It’s impossible to let people go. Is it a big thing that local officials will let us go? The time has been exploited so badly. Now let him lose his face in the face of imperialism and lose his job. We are going to use it to kill the group of guys and then take the money and go home." He is also the idea of ​​most people. It has attracted a lot of approval. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
