			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How could my brother be like this?" Ai Mei, in the dungeon, looked at Yabin with a red eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not like there is something weird." Yabin looked around and determined that no one outside the dungeon would hear the voice of the two people. Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second time after he was arrested. For the first time, when I heard the Elf Knight stabbing the Granden Tower and then covering the cursed magic, Abin said to Ayimei with the last little effort: "Don't He talked indiscriminately." After that, he spoke again and his expression was a dull face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" Ai Meimei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We seem to step into who's trap. But luck is not good for our traps. We are just foiling."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two Pegasus Knights are all the hands of the Luya elders, no matter how they are born. It’s impossible for them to be involved with others. And it’s absolutely impossible for them to kill the great magician like the Granden Tower master?” It’s until this time that the expression on the face of Abin’s face is completely responsive to the usual savvy and capable. . "This is definitely a trap, so I told you not to talk indiscriminately. The more you show in this situation, the less you will not pay attention to us, the more chance we have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You said that this is all arranged? Fake, five people with three towers at the time saw it. They all said that the Granden Tower was not prepared..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The few people were controlled by mental magic." Although Abin was still tied and thrown on the ground, the light in his eyes seemed to be a beast that suddenly became a crouch from a harmless rabbit. "I saw the Cardinal's Necromancer in Elasia. I felt a little similar magical fluctuations and the look of the few magicians seemed odd."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elemental magician’s ability to perceive magic in the unintentional state is incomparable to the white magician pastor and templar, and Abbott’s impression of mental magic is so deep that even himself Deliberately forget the point that you can't forget. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But no one in the Tower of the Mind will have mental magic. And this unpopular magic is rarely cultivated..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin thought for a moment and said, "Isn’t I heard that Aiden’s master has come to a guest? But how did you see such a big thing? I can do it with Master Aiden. The people who interact with the great magician. How can it not be ordinary people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Also on the main and missing Ayreta Lord I have never heard of any friends outside of my friends. Is it what you mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abandoned silently and shook his head: "What is it?" I don't know if it is clear that we are still running away as quickly as possible. There is no need to stay here to make a contradictory funeral inside the Tower of the Tooth." As he spoke, he stood up and the rope tied up on his body slipped down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are the magicians, not the thieves. The knot is no different for the Abin and the children. The main method of restraint of the magician is not the two ropes but the curses of weakness and slowness in the two bodies. But unfortunately, even the master-level element curse is hard to continue under the purification of white magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dungeon locks a flame magic that is strong enough to withstand the guru's level. But Abin only opened it with a small wire. These thieves' small doorways are not so difficult to learn, especially for those who want to learn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the two were about to sneak out, a messy footstep rushed in. Abin indicated that Ayimei was lying back in the corner and then stood by the door and hid. Here are the magicians as long as they are close to him and have absolute advantages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he just seems to be unnecessary. A group of magic apprentices rushed into the dungeon for the magical female apprentice of the Fire Tower. She held a magic key in her hand and slammed it into the magic lock that had already been opened. Pulled the door open. Shouting at the inside: "We are here to save you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
