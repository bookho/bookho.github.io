			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dim first ball is already high on the horizon. If there is no more thing in the sky, no one will believe that it will be extinguished immediately. The candle-like ball of light is the sun that can be used to make the eyes clear in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desert where the sun is cold is not warmer than the ice sheet, and the cold is cold and cold without any moisture. The dead gray sky is like a huge pot cover with no trace of clouds on it, not to mention that the birds are only hanging from the sun like a wildfire. This past, the hellish Heilongjiang desert is now like a huge cemetery. Even here is the tens of thousands of the most powerful tens of thousands of the army in the air, all still in silence and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only based on magic maps to detect and judge constantly scouting reconnaissance is watching the dynamics of the king of the undead and the undead army is still fine Into the micro-stringent seam. As planned, all the troops that can reach have arrived. They are all here waiting quietly for the upcoming common enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tens of thousands of troops have not made any noise, only occasionally have a life that screams powerfully and screams the atmosphere and tremendous pressure so that they can’t even speak . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two blue giants of different dimensions are flashing with a steady stream of orc troops and warrior magicians who are lining up. This is the last batch of the most elite soldiers. Behind the troops are the heads of Roland and Lancelot. And the two tower owners of Adelaide Grandon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last step in the door of the different dimension is two people. Gru and Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru is still wearing the upper body without any protective gear. He doesn't seem to need these things in the water. But he now holds the black longbow in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s completely different from the Elf Patrolman’s hand. This phantom bow is no longer plain. There is a layer of sparkling light on it. In the wave light, the number of Yuan Fu, which is complicated and difficult to understand, is hidden in the ascent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A big big squad..." The door of the different dimension behind him slowly closed Asa and looked at the tens of thousands of troops in front of him and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This look is all human. And these are not ordinary children. They are the most outstanding fighters. Only the purpose of these soldiers here is to desperately escort him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back at them is a black mountain with a high and undulating edge. This is what he has heard about countless times. The Shadow Mountain Range that I have seen until now. The Devil's Guild and the Dark Star are behind this boundless mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incomparable black breath is coming out of that direction. It is already dark and almost invisible to the naked eye. Where is the sky? This mountain is like a huge tombstone. It’s not just his tombstone but the gravestone of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I came to this place and his family was so entangled for so long, Asa’s hand was tightly held on the knife at the waist. It was the ruler of the king who had exhausted his strength with the knife in his own hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This knife was originally taken away when the Glorious Castle was arrested. This is what he asked Lancelot to send to the site of the Glorious Castle. I don’t know if it was infected by the king of the dead spirit or was washed by the bright light of the archangel. The original magic attached to it has disappeared. This knife has been reduced to an unimaginable ordinary weapon. He collected the ordinary weapons that his father made with his own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selecting a magic weapon in the church and the School of Magic is definitely more powerful than this knife, but Asa still brought the knife. What he wants is actually not a weapon. It is the feeling when holding this knife. The unpretentious and familiar touch that comes from the hands of the present can give him a little more peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is wearing the gown of the Ghost King. It seems to have been affected by the undulations from the depths of the Shadow Mountain Range. This magical robe seems to live alive and echoes with his body's breath, while also breathing in the depths of the mountain. The air condenses like a dead. The robes are constantly shaking slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The guy is still more than sixty miles away from here..." Asa closed his eyes and said. Connected with the feeling of the ghost king's robe. He can feel the huge fluctuations that are going forward here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
