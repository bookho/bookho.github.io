			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pain. It hurts to get through the lungs and soak the bones. This pain is like a red-hot needle stringing into the pain that has spread all over the body and inserted into the crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original thing that was agitating and jumping desperately to get into the emptiness from the crack was directly exploded by the thorn, like the one that was buried underneath The explosives have been forced to heat up to the critical point and are now completely detonated by this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consciousness of the void is completely blown up. The smashing out of it is that life is power. Instinct breaks through the void and consciousness breaks out from his body directly. A scream followed and Rolander flew out and flew out. The way this reaction is not the fifth of the Necromancer is the way of Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the red blood in his already cracked wounds spurted out and seemed to be a water bag that had been filled with blood. With countless holes, blood flows through every part of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain is so great that the pain is mad and tortured to crush his feelings. The power that has always supported his body and consciousness has faded away from Asa to feel his body now. Where is the damage? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wounds he suffered were not too small and he was not light and many times almost died. Compared with his current injuries, they almost never Called an injury. Now all over the body from the muscle skin to the smallest vascular nerves are all broken. Just slamming Roland's head with his head, so that his forehead's scalp is also turned over. There are at least three root muscles because of congestion. He did not even think that he had not slammed into a pile of meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this full of pain full of consciousness, he suddenly faintly thought about how I did not put down the hilt in my hand? It seems that all this is because of this hilt and along the way his eyes fell on the left hand of the black star hilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to let go but can't open it. It’s not just that the hilt and the palm of the hand seem to have been glued together and that he has to let go of his thoughts, and there are countless other gatherings that immediately obstruct him. In the sea, he seems to be able to see three black figures entangled and the hilt is echoed and feels echoed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood that rushed from him was running along the arm and flowing toward the hilt. But no drop can flow on the hilt. The icy black-skinned hilt seemed to be a red-hot soldering iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The slight cracking sound was uploaded from the hilt and it was clear that there was no attack on the hilt but the cracks were constantly increasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Swords Rays broke through and Lancelot’s Holy Cross Cross Sword finally arrived, but he did not hit Asa’s body. Instead, he hit the hilt of his left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Roland fell out and blocked him. His shot was slower than just a shot, but it was because of this that he saw the change of Asa. Perhaps it is because it is certain that Asa is already awake. It may be that he saw signs of rupture on the hilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hilt is destroyed. It may indeed be more problem-solving than killing Asa. The hilt seems to have been on the edge of the rupture, and as long as there is no extra force, it can be broken into countless pieces. Lancelot is not wrong with this choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, the light of the Sword of the Sword is just the hand of the sword in the middle of the week, and the larger cracking sound immediately bursts from the hilt. It can be seen that the crack on the top suddenly becomes deeper and becomes bigger and immediately shattered. But at the same time, Lancelot's white sword light completely dissipated because a black sword passed through his heart and lungs from his side and buckled into his right hand with all the swordsman's sword. As soon as the disintegration of the ashes did not leave completely disappeared into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unwilling to be the last remaining thought of Lancelot. Just add a little more force to him and the Holy Light Cross Sword for a hundredth of a second to really break the hilt. But unfortunately, he was wearing a dark star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crash dissipated. Lancelot was ten times faster than the Vaderna in the air. He could only use all his strength to look back and smile at Talis, who was running here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This smile is no longer the slightest of the Paladin. The sacred above has bitterness and more kindness and love. This is a father who finally released all hidden feelings. Smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the back air, Lear fell heavily on the chest of the ground. There is a hole that is spreading around. The body of the sacred crystal dragon is also vulnerable under the black star. She encouraged her to look back and see Roland's hard to spit out the last words: "Stupid, I told you to kill the kid is not to attack you against the dark star"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lill’s body quickly disappeared completely, and only a small piece of crystal fell from her disappearing head to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot has just left nothing. My body shape completely dissipated. The dark sword body is revealed. It seems to have the same life in the air and then aligns with the hilt in Asa's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no complete connection to the sword. The endless breath has spread to the hilt of the hilt. The countless cracks begin to heal in this breath. Asa’s eyes returned to a lot of air and the breath of the air once again merged with the dark consciousness in his mind. All the power of life that has just emerged is once again submerged under the endless emptiness of darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is becoming an endless black endless emptiness endless endless. The ground is also becoming the same emptiness as the emptiness of the sky. Roland, who just got up from the ground, feels like he is standing in the void of the universe above nine days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the power of the complete Dark Star of the Complete Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. Under the feet, the ground smashed the magma and burst into the sky. Gru took out the last foot and finally arrived at the green and white glory with the only dazzling in the dark emptiness. Sand and stone, splashing Talis. Rolander all fell in the windy airflow from Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still did not shoot for Asa but grabbed the left hand of Assana with a hilt. The other hand actually grabbed the sword that was slowly blending with the hilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The kid is waking up." A roar almost shook the whole dark void and shattered all the light into the hands of Grudy. He was really He has taken the Dark Star and he has to pull the sword out of his own strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stood like a puppet and did not move with the squeak of Gru in his ear, letting Gru hold his hand. His hand holding the sword is slowly turning into obsidian. The same obsidian as the Dark Star. His body began to have a subtle black scent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no power to stop it. Asa’s emptiness is clearly visible in Gru’s efforts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already at this point and no one can stop it. The sword is still slowly blending. After all, it is not the power of human beings. The black breath and the white light madness are killing each other, but the black breath is no longer the same as the sword handle. Now this is the whole dark star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click. The white light split and Gru's hand cracked. Even the most invincible and powerful hand in this world can't resist the power of this dark and empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despair. Talis felt a sharp, sour and weak, from the deepest part of her heart, disappearing from the hope of all the forces of the body. They are not far from here but have stopped. This is the most profound despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sharp sword stabbed Asa’s chest from the side. Although not big enough, but fierce and fierce, it is like a dying beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shot is Roland. At this time, only he can shoot his original, elegant and handsome face, which has almost completely rotted and deformed. Falling in the same way as a scorpion like a scorpion, the remaining one of the eyes of the whole blood is all the blood of the painful despair and the final fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last chance. He has concentrated all his strength to fight this last chance. The black star has not fully integrated with Asa's hand has changed, but the head is still full of blood and pain. He is smashing this opportunity to hit Asa's head into pieces. This is a sword that he has burned his life into power and lethality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Squeaking Gru finally fell off his hands on the white grudges and rushed out with a few invisible blood. At the same time, the palm of the hand with the palm of the hand slammed into the smashing of the smashing blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is incredibly self-sufficient in his arms. It seems that she should never be so smart and so rational that she can do. Even she was a little surprised. From a rational point of view, she knew that she should never stop this and even use it. But when I saw Roland's most deductive sword stabbing Asa, who was standing still with scars and blood puppets, she did not have time to produce her and jumped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who is rational is a woman. This is the sorrow of a woman and the greatness of a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wake up, I beg you, you wake up." Through the big hole in her chest, I can clearly see the Roland after her efforts to lift up. It was the blood of the hand holding the poison of Asa Muran's face, and looked sadly at him with tears and blood mixed with his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood splashed into the scorpion of Asa's emptiness and turned the emptiness into a bloody red bloody void. The center was only a small tear. The blood of the two deep visible bone wounds is reflected in the blood, but it is a piece of ice-water clear and desolate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice is getting weaker and the tears are filled with tears. The eyes are dry and can't help but slowly close but seem to be reluctant to close. I tried my best to see Asa’s hand and still holding Asa’s face. Mouting in his mouth: "Wake up. I beg you"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, her eyes can no longer support it, but there is still a last A line of tears from the inside, holding Asa’s hand, finally hangs down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly Asa’s face twitched*. There seems to be something burning in the scorpion of the original empty oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood that splatters on him and the blood that he is already drying up make him feel like he is going to burn and even his consciousness is empty. It is also red, which is hot and hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not just from the outside but the inside is hot. It’s the hot pain that burns from the void behind the emptiness itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of the red blood rushed from him and the blood merged with his blood. It really burned on the body surrounded by this black breath. The burnt black breath was as mad as he was around the circumference of his body, and the body was silently disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flaming of the blood is so bright that only the life is only the burning of life can have such a color. This hot hot has already burned his whole soul to the red. The void that can be annihilated is gradually softening. The tingling of a sharp and sour sorrow is about to be broken out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah" a scream of screaming from Asa's mouth. The bloody red fire and the illusory black madness rolled around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also disappeared into the red and black waves. His palm did hit Asa’s chest but was limited to hitting. The body that is full of scars seems to be broken at any time, but now it is hard to imagine that the sword of the mountain rock novel can not even break the skin, not just can not be broken, even if it is recovered, it is impossible to suddenly grow up. . The red and black waves are just a tumbling. He doesn't even have a scream. He disappears completely.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cry of Asa is gradually re-converting from sorrow. It was empty and then stopped. The black breath spread into his eyes and it was killing the blood red a little bit. The blade of the Dark Star has been almost completely integrated with the hilt. Only the crack in the upper one is getting bigger and bigger. When the crack completely disappears, it is the time when the complete king of the dead spirit appears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red flaming black smoldering entangled more vigorously and more intensely Asa’s figure is no longer visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis has been completely stunned, only tears are constantly flowing, she can’t do it, she can’t do it, she can only look at it desperately. There seems to be no more way. It is not that Asa is severely fragmented by this black and red, or is the king of the true completeness of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still one person who looks at it all, but he will never and will never just look at the situation where no matter how serious the injury is, then it is impossible to despair again. Can't let him just watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru’s hands are almost no longer a pair of hands. This pair of works originally created by God to force the meaning of life to be perfect is now only blurred. Blood and bone inside the skeleton. Then his expression did not have the slightest stagnation, no trace of frustration, failure, hardship, fortitude, fierceness, fierceness, and all the concepts that represented this kind of meaning together strengthened one hundred times and could not describe one percent of his momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brilliance of the vindictiveness has disappeared. He was smashed into the front of Asa by the body and the body was smashed into the place where he was rushing into the body. He finally rushed to the front of Asa and waved his fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fragmented shape of the hand that has been completely split is no longer the strongest weapon in the world, and there is no dazzling vindictiveness. The blood that was swayed by the sky, but he was still so determined, so swallowed the mountain because it was his fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wake me up! Bastard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red and black broke apart in this boxing Asa's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grunting fist broke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most complete weapon of this strongest weapon is finally completely broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey Asa’s first one is not just Gru’s fist. He clearly hears his own brain and what is broken in his heart. It is. It was broken by this broken punch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fist flies out of the blood and flesh and then splashes over the whole body of Asa. The red fire is suddenly more prosperous. It seems that this is not blood. It is not just red. There is also the golden glare of the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment is under the flame and the breath of the Dark Star is covered. This fire is not just burning. It is still burning in his body. Even Asa’s eyes are also the dazzling sun. The flames are no longer black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Asa calls out, this is no longer a struggle The screaming is not a meaningless scream or a hollow voice of the king of the dead king. This is completely his own voice. He has completely awakened Gru's fist. The flames of the three men mixed up in the blood finally broke the messy memories of all the dark souls in his consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s a buzzing voice, there isn’t a bit of anger in this voice. It’s all sadness and there is no room for any other feelings of pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the things he had just seen, he remembered that this sober and painful pain even covered up the pain of the whole body and almost destroyed his spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he knows that he can't pour his right hand's knife to his left hand that has become completely integrated with the Dark Star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no power to blacken the power of the black star to fade the broken body, no more power, or even just lift this hand, the muscles are falling apart. He used this sorrow to use this sorrow to use the feelings he had left on his face in the face of his previous novels. The blood mixed with his body used Lancelot to use Roland to escort him here. The sacrifice of tens of thousands of soldiers has been cut down with the shackles of his life. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knife broken this piece of his father’s hand-worn knives that he experienced with countless battles slashed on the black arm like a piece of paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fate of the autumn has been hired in his hand. The ring of the king who should have used up his strength should have gone. It seems that the white light flashed into the mouth of the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The card fights his broken mouth and broken. The whole piece was broken into small pieces and dropped from his sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a drop of the black star that has been sucked and the arm of his arm is also broken with the arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the dark hell, the endless black rush of the cracked hilt, without any sound, but all the things瓿 Cover all phagocytosis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why didn't you kill me at the beginning? You should do it." Asa struggled to see Gru screaming and asking tears to rush from the eyes of the people. It is mixed with blood and water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have said that I will not let you die if I am not dead." Gru looked at Asa faintly saying that although the tone is still so flat and arrogant But the voice is weak and his body is no longer complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
