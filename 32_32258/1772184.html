			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swords and swords did not anticipate the earth-shattering loud noises and shocks, and even did not produce any sound at all, as if two unreal virtual images were silently connected. After the knife and the sword collided together, they did not separate but briefly stuck together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two weapons are not separated and neither of them has moved. The dark red light on the knife's body, like the bloody vein, began to dissipate under the impact of the white light. The white light spread from the cross sword to the blade. The original dark red knife has become like a holy weapon that has been blessed by the Holy Spirit. The white magic that overflows with brilliance shines brightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not just the white light of the blade, but also the tide that spreads toward Asa, from the wrist to the chest, although the situation is wrong, but this is not the case. Inexplicable opponents, they do not know how to intervene even more dare to intervene. But it was a few blinks of time. The white light has covered Asa's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa can feel the power of mixing the magic and vindictiveness in his body. But it is not ruining. Although this power is so strong that it may not be devastating, it is not destructive and devastating. It only flows along its veins and even senses. He even felt as if he had fallen into a huge hot water river and was pushed and pulled by the irresistible force. Every point in every part of his body is drowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A light-sounding sword finally separated Asha and took a few steps back and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Light Cross Sword He made a little bit of light in the hands of Lancelot and turned back into a small piece of seemingly unremarkable cross. Lancelot sighed and hung the cross back to the neck. Thoughtfully looking at the face of Assad on the ground, the amount of fatigue on the amount of already on the sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two shrine knights were relieved and didn’t even look at the wanted man on the ground. They are very clear that even if they use paralysis and add dozens of steel locks, there will be no prohibition effect caused by this sword. And the paralysis technique uses magic to condense and cure the vitality in the opponent's body. The incomparably powerful force in the sword directly covers all the anger and function. Although this method is subtle and subtle, but the effect is completely overwhelming. Unless the vitality of this person can be greater than the power of Lancelot, even if it is ingenious, it is impossible to dispel this mix of vindictiveness and magic. effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the two knights are still a little confused. If there are at least a hundred different ways to leave this opponent, even if it is not to be harmless, there will be no less than twenty. But Lancelot is obviously the most laborious. Probably because he saw the cardinal's paralysis is not obvious for this opponent's production. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot looked at Assana’s thick eyebrows on the ground and wrinkled more and more tightly. Then he waved and waved at the two Knights of the Temple: "Take him away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christine looked at Jessica and hesitated. Edric did not care that the Hilton three next to him did not care about going straight to the Assati on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hilton and Druid did not dare to shake the Jessica with both hands clenched a pair of short swords. After all, there is still no shot. The strength gap is really too big, even if it is shot, it makes no sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Adelik just mentioned Asa’s move to Lancelot, the transmission magic array suddenly lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very few opportunities for the use of the transfer magic array in Tula. The elves rarely go out here. The number of people who can get the transfer reel here is very rare, but the one that sends out the magical array is the one that glows at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue light hasn’t dissipated yet, but I can’t see who is inside, but it’s like a mountain, a tsunami, a thousand horses, a killing, no killing, no killing. The killing murder has been as strong as a sharp knife in the air. Not only does the skin feel even strong to the ear but can only be smelled by the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instinct that has been experienced in countless battles is the closest to the transmission of the magical array. Adek immediately slams the gun and flies his movements. The knight's skill is definitely not slow in any situation in front of anyone, but he is still carrying a person in his hand. Although he instinctively felt the murderous violent and incomparable, he still did not let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure with a blue light that transmits magic has already rushed out of the magical array and shot at Adriatic as a sharp arrow, but there is no such thing as a murderous such a power and such a degree. It was only this short moment that the expression on the face of the Knights of the Temple changed from amazement to panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another faster person is Lancelot. In fact, when the light of the magical light is just shining, he has already been alert to the cross that just brought his neck. It is already in hand. And when the overwhelming murder is like out of the air, the Holy Light Cross Sword is instantly formed, but this time the sword is no longer held in the hand but extends to the whole body of his body. A huge sword. He single-handedly imaginary flying and the whole body drove the huge lightsaber to the shadows of the magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword of the opposite of Asa’s sword just showed the majestic momentum of swearing. Now the sword will explode all the imposing manners and majesty. The most destructive and most lethal thing that comes out is like the bow that is full of strings gives the feeling of strength, but when its strings are put into the power, it is the most terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aidelik is back. The man who rushed out of the magic circle was chasing. Lancelot was gathering at a point almost simultaneously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a little closer to the Hilton, and the three of them were directly thrown out by this huge airstream. This is not a magical explosion but simply a shock and impact from each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including all the people in the presence of Christine who didn’t have time to catch up, they didn’t see how the three figures collided and they made some what. The three of them had suddenly separated when they reacted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point where the three people meet is trapped in a semi-circular pit. And Adriek, who returned to Christine here, was amazed. The anger is still unbelievable. The guns in his hand have been bent out of shape. From the distortion of the look, it seems that the thing that just squeezed out of the clay has been twisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But everyone knows that the weapons in the hands of the Knights of the Temple will never be mud. In fact, this sacred gun can not even be regarded as a weapon in the ordinary sense. It is the same as the Glorious Battlegear. The top magic item is the weapon that is specially built by Celeste to fight against Nygen. Even the power of the ogre and the huge tomahawk. The incompetent material or the magical force attached to it is the best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Adriatic’s anger and surprise are not because of this but because his other hand is empty. The person who was originally carrying has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even when he felt extremely dangerous, he did not give up the captive. It was the command of Lancelot, but this person was born from him. I robbed people back in my hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was angry and didn’t re-fly to the idea of ​​robbing people back because he knew very well that if there was no Lancelot shot, not just people were robbed back. Even he himself is already dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same returning Lancelot's light cross sword has dissipated his brown head slightly messy and even in a slight gasp of the brown scorpion firmly The person locked in front of him looks like a mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person has no weapons. Even the body even did not have his high and slightly thinner pair of black sea scorpions facing the opposite paladin. Asa, who was originally in the hands of Edric, is now in his hands. Such an unarmed man has robbed people from the hands of the Knights of Megatron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one can be able to retreat under the combined force of a shrine knight and a paladin. The man's right hand is already bloody. Just now, this finger was long and even elegant. The hand of the Shrine Knight punched the battlefield in the hands of the Knights of the Temple and then hit the Lancelot's Holy Cross. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key is that he now appears to be sweating on his forehead. He has been a full blow just now. And the injury is not just the right hand that looks like it. But no one can dare to think that there is an organic fit, no matter how tired or injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man grabbed Asa but didn’t even look at him. His all his attention was on the opposite side of the paladin. The most gaze is actually surprised at the same time: "Is it you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
