			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I knew you would say this, I still want to thank you." Asa smiled at Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it’s the resonance of people who have the leaves of the world tree and the waves of the sun, maybe there is real meditation, even if everyone else does not know he can be clear Feel the changes in the body of Gru. He clearly felt that Gru was still standing there as a statue, but in fact the body that had been eroded by the Dark Star was flying back to recover the enormous vitality in the body. He knows that he will recover. This is the reason he can be calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't thank me. You saved me twice. How can I get you to be the cannon fodder by these guys who are arguing here?" Lu did not laugh, just cold eyes stunned a few people around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible?" Elder Lloyd looked at the wrinkles on the face of Gru who stood up from the altar and squeezed into a pile that seemed to fall off immediately. . "The sun well water and the leaves of the world tree are the divine powers that only have the purest elves of the elves to be able to fuse..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope has two teeth The tower's tower owner's face is very ugly and Lancelot's face can't be described as unsightly. People who haven't seen it can never imagine that such an expression would appear on such a strong and deep person. It was an unbelievable look that looked at the person who became a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, this is Oufu’s current general of Gru? It’s a good momentum.” Aideli looked at Gru’s eyes like water. The same as the addition of a few hundred barrels of honey, a pool of hot springs can be immersed in the middle of a man into a mud. "But... everything has a discussion, isn't it? You can't just rely on your words..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s up to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru’s voice is like Wannian granite Cold and hard, he opened Adelly and immediately felt that he had stopped looking at his mouth and immediately became a pool of stagnant water. This is the gap in the imposing manner. The instinct of the retreat is like a golden pheasant who does not dare to pose in front of the lion and tiger. Just as his eyes were hard and savage, he had been seeing the deepest eyes of Aidelide. "I will not kill you if I send you a message. But it is only under the premise that the other party has not taken the initiative to find death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main face of the water tower tower suddenly became a blue. She had already held a reel behind her hand but did not have the guts to pull it out. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that, when she spoke, Granada’s bishop, Lancelot, could feel a drop of water on her back. a bit. A master-level magician should have absolute certainty and no awareness of this suggestive trick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other three people also felt the hint of Aidelide but they did not. Because they feel stronger on the other hand, they can't feel the shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granden Tower Lord is only vaguely feeling that even if you shoot, you may have no use of this person's momentum has already explained enough strength. The pope can clearly feel that the breath of the dark star that was originally filled in the body has not been left. Now it seems that he is not in the sun. The one in the castle is shocking but not compelling. In the deeper sense, they all understand that he can only be stronger than the day as the top warrior. The feeling of Lancelot, who is once and for all, is undoubtedly the clearest from his expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contrast on the force has been reversed. The three people have turned their eyes to the Bolugan adults. Only he seems to be able to talk to Gru. The person who speaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need for them to signal that Bolugan has already ran to Gru and said: "Guru is not really good, but now The situation is really not good. It is not that the situation at this time is the whole big 6 situation, so please calmly..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru just looked at him The mouth of Bolugan’s adult was immediately closed. The expression on the big face twisted him and then looked back at the Pope. They sighed heavily and made a powerful conclusion saying, "It seems that it is calm enough."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone did not speak for a long while, and the Pope began to use a hoarse voice to slowly ask: "Do you really understand what you are doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay, I have nothing to say. What is different in words is nonsense." The Pope's voice is getting old and hoarse. He looks at the two tower masters of the Tower of Tooth. "What about you two?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not really good at what it means to say that this is not a person who can understand." Aidely's face is still still looking at Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of them are silent. This is actually not a matter of ignorance, but he simply does not bother to listen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fist is big enough, the reason is not to be called the truth, at least not the truth that can make any actual effect. Everyone who is present is very good at speaking. The reasoned person naturally understands this truth more naturally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the surprise, the elder Lloyd has been saying that it’s not just like an old tree that has fallen and is ready to fall. The turbid old eyes kept looking at the people present. At this time, he slowly gestured to the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let us know your plans, maybe... we will cooperate with you." The pope sighed deeply and turned to the tree. Going to his footsteps was a little embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no way to choose the only option, but it is not easy to decide that I will choose this method first. The two tower lords immediately followed him, and the elder Lloyd looked strangely at Glu and turned away with Lucia and Karin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot finally left with a strange look at Gru, shaking his head and said: "I actually have a question that you really have. Is it human... Isn’t it really a normal living thing with blood and flesh?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a small war on the old tree Lu Bolugan adults Asa and Gru four. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting from Gru, Sandro’s eyes and attention are the same as others. It was completely attracted to him and it was until this time that he could sigh with long and deep emotion: "It is really the age of young people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His expression has been relaxed a lot with more exhaustion. His spirit and body magic have just collapsed to the limit. The self-mutilated body of the dead magic is unplugged by the loss of vitality. A finger is so simple. If you continue to do so, you may not need the Pope to take the shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the Polugan’s face is not good-looking, but not like the Pope and Lancelot, they are emotionally undoubtedly Sa is just under the powerful logic of his huge head. This is a friend who is absolutely not enough to influence the values ​​and choices. In any case, it is no match for the entire Oufu and other thousands of people. Now it’s completely unreasonable. Even if the situation is such that the situation is extremely unreasonable and does not meet his efficiency and aesthetics, at least emotionally he is a lot easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa and Gru did not blame him for anything. From a certain point of view, this is an extremely simple person who is simpler than his mind. Both can predict his position and reaction. It's also simple enough to make people undefended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a way to deal with that monster?" Gru looked at Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. Even the Elves can only choose to join them with Lancelot. Do I have a better way?" Asa shook his head and smiled. "You have "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that we think the same." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excuse me..." Bolugan asked in a very careful tone His original big eyes are now too big to fall out. Even if people are simple, his thinking ability is definitely not simple. He has already guessed something from these two conversations. "What you call the arrangement is Isn't it actually arranged or not? Or can you say that what you have to do is similar to what they have to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa thought for a bitter smile and nodded Let's just say that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Sander almost jumped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
