			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;小懿 can't sleep in bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beds in the hotel are made up of a large shelf of wood that is roughly stacked with a few planks and a bit of hay. And this bed has a layer of linen and a cotton cloth that can be used as a quilt and a hay pillow is already the most upscale facility in this hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of sleeping on this is of course far from being lying on the bed of goose down cotton in the ducal palace. But the little one is not concerned about this cold and humid from the deep mountains. She went to the dragon desert where she could roast cooked eggs. No matter what the place is, it is much stronger than the Duke's House, which has to wear gorgeous and cumbersome costumes to deal with etiquette and entertainment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Mulak is not a hereditary title. The Duke was born only as a local nostalgic family. Because of the outstanding achievements in the war between the Empire and the South in the past 20 years, it was sealed and then stepped up to the present position by personal ability and means. Xiaoyan is not the same as other children of the wealthy family. She is soaked in the prosperity of the rich and the rich and the father's hard work and the education method that was very careful in the early years cultivated her independent character. Her masculine and mature character, which has no father at all, makes her particularly tired of the illusory life of the upper class aristocrats. She prefers to use the spirit in some practical places. In order to get rid of the tired and tired Duchess, I went to work at the Pharmacy of the School of Magic. She often feels fulfilled when she goes around to explore the satisfaction of new things that have not been seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was very upset when her father helped her with her marriage. Under the strict guidance of her father, she rarely thinks about things like love, not to mention getting married, and the rules of the wealthy family of the El Nie family are very strict. She also hates the fiancé who only has the word 'power' in her eyes, but she does not resist. She knows very well that this is just a common political marriage in the aristocratic door. She also knows that this marriage is very important to her father. And she has always been a very sensible daughter who loves her father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So before she got married, she used the excuse to help the pharmacy collect herbs to study the medicinal properties and go out to travel and take risks. She wants to live a truly complete free life in this last time, so she even plans to travel to the Big 6 most dangerous area. ‘If you’re dead,’ she sometimes thinks a little bit like herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that in the lizard swamp she almost died. When she knew that her injury was so heavy that she could only lie on the bed and wait to die, she looked at the somewhat frustrated father and the still indifferent fiancé. She didn't feel sad. But when she saw that the person was very determined to find a way to save her, she suddenly became completely weak and felt that it was worthwhile to die like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she later woke up from the dying long-term drowsiness, she had completely miraculously recovered from the father’s mouth and learned that the person was really She found a magical drug. She knew that the wedding was not far away and her father would not allow her to go out alone but she strongly wanted to see him. This is just a very simple and strong desire. She quietly ran out again in Bracada and finally found him as if he had come to this strange city with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have been very happy these days and have never been so happy. Everything here is so strange that there are strange scenes that can't be finished every day and everything seems to be lively and orderly as if it came to a free new world. More importantly, he is with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can see from the clues on the ground what kind of beasts have passed here before half a day. It can also be determined from the taste of the wind and the clouds in the sky. Weather. He also knows how to make red tobacco bark is a good condiment. How to make it can make people diarrhea not only know what kind of earth mushroom to eat, but also make people laugh and know how to burn the buttocks of the dog to know how to eat. In fact, there are good tastes that are not commensurate with the appearance. These novel topics will never get bored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a very simple person. It seems as if I am suddenly ignorant of the world from the isolated forest. He doesn't know literature. He doesn't know that poetry doesn't believe in gods. He doesn't understand many common-sense problems. He doesn't understand sometimes it's childish and simple, but he can show the most sophisticated and astounding at any time. deep. The two seem to have a tacit understanding of what he had saved her before. After a day or two, the two of them did not have the slightest barriers. The nature of the conversation was as long as the old thieves felt that they were indeed 'lovers'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, she knows that she will leave here and go back to the Empire tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father’s marriage, which has been almost completely forgotten, is the responsibility of the life of the fiancé Wang Duo. These things have been discussed as if they had been ambushed together. The strike was ruined. Before she started this journey, she still had the thoughts to go back, but then this new environment and new mood made her forget these things quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But forgetting doesn't mean that these things don't exist. The feeling of falling down when the clouds in the happy world suddenly appear in these corners is even more unpredictable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first time in her life, she had the idea of ​​completely abandoning her father and family responsibilities. But the thought was just a flash but it was immediately hurriedly extinguished by myself. The mother died early and her father gave birth to her. Even when she was busy with her official duties and entertainment, she never ignored her education. She loves her father very well and knows the importance of this marriage to her father as a daughter. She has a responsibility to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the desire to continue to live so sweetly and carelessly grows in the heart and does not make a concession with a strong sense of responsibility and heavy fatherly love. Finally she could not make her own choice. So she made a decision that seemed completely absurd: tell him about it and let him make the decision. If he doesn't want to go back on his own, then he really forgets to travel with him around the big 6 to travel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he heard that after she went back to get married, she just closed her eyes in the pile of hay as usual. She was very sad and blew tears after blowing out the lights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lying in bed, she couldn’t sleep anyway, and I knew from his breathing that he didn’t fall asleep. Her heart almost jumped out of her throat when she heard the sound of the hay and heard him stand up and sneak up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he just walked out of the door quietly through the bed and then the voice gradually went away and seemed to be out of the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't even have the power of curiosity to sit up from the bed and sit down at the window and watch the sky outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beauty of the plateau starry sky is never seen by people who have never seen it. When you know that the beauty of the changes in the world will continue forever, the viewer will realize that the human beings are less than all the sadness that people have endured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it’s been seen, suddenly accompanied by a huge bang, a huge spark in the distant sky, igniting the entire Oufu city It is. At that moment, even the stars were eclipsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not a sentimental person. But when she saw this huge and beautiful flame, she suddenly felt that it was a human life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the eternal starry sky, this is just a matter of a blink of an eye. But in this blink of an eye it is the most beautiful thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is short, it is beautiful. I don’t know if it’s a short-lived beauty or a beautiful moment. She remembered that she had been crying for a short period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This beautiful and sorrowful language is that her sister usually likes to hang on her lips. She often teaches her sisters that they are just nervous and have nothing to do. Only then. But I didn't think of myself but I felt these things at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This loud noise awakened the entire city of Oufu. The orcs went out of the house and looked at the sounding place. But it didn't take long for the Orcs to start to slap the torch to tell the orcs that it was just a magical experiment by the master of the city. It was no big deal and everyone could go back to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole city riots gradually subsided while the hotel’s half-orc boss came to the thieves’ room with another half-orc and a werewolf to ask questions and then quickly Found her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lord of the City has something to ask you to take a trip." The Orc said very respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The werewolf carried her on her shoulders and flew to the place where she had just fired. The wind was so bad that her eyes could not be opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn't like the smell of the werewolf that reminds her of the death and fear of the lizard swamp. She faintly feels a very ominous premonition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
