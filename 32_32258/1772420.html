			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The armor of his body has no special shape and is as unconventional as the original Ghost of the Ghost. Just plain old and thick fiber is old like an old woman. The fabric will wrap the owner's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing special about people. It seems that there is no difference between them and it is still a face that looks very ordinary and has a sense of glory and wildness. Even the eyes are still very clear, but the expression is an empty void wearing all the emptiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not tall and not majestic or even too breathtaking, but everyone feels that he is indeed different from the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the end. Everything is over here." He said quietly that there was almost no sound but everyone who listened no matter where they stood It is very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can make a sound in silence. They are not afraid or surprised because everyone has been surprised that they simply don’t have any sound. It is indeed the end of the heart of everyone's heart. This is the fact that what is said from his mouth is not the order nor the fact that the declaration is a ready-made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one voice that sounds abruptly loud. It’s not people who are so harsh in this silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This breath... This is the real king of the dead." Moriel was surprised first and then laughed and laughed. "It's actually this kid is actually this kid..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is more angular than any male, and looks more like a personality. Is the extreme anger or the ecstasy of the flaming head dancing. It’s as crazy as her laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? Is it really just a part of his substitute before using this way to make him the king of the Necromancer? No wonder I feel that That kind of weakness." Morrill's narrow pupil burst into a stunning yellow light while her body was also exploding. The red woman in the black tights became a huge black dragon in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I actually let such a guy slip away from my mouth? I actually contributed to the birth of this king of the dead spirit? It is ridiculous. Aki Bud, is this what you mean by summing up all the fate? Even I am even a part of this fate? This is nonsense, I am once again affirmed. I will completely destroy this thing for you now. "The black dragon's huge roar is still full of complicated and strange sounds. Her voice and dragon language magic can simultaneously interfere with each other." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait." Gru drunk and he woke up from the surprise. Even this shock can't make him look sloppy. He grabbed Moriel's foot in one hand. "He hasn't lost consciousness. He is still him. I feel it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, I have my own consciousness. How can he be the real dead spirit? King?” Morrier’s laughter and chanting did not stop. "Can you accept that the Dark Star really agrees with you? Do you think you can persuade him to throw away that thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night-like laughter was interrupted intermittently. Come in, although this voice is very weak. It’s hard to hear but almost laughs at all the delights and excitement of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out to be like this..." Ved Nina’s face was constantly shaking his face, and the dead flesh seemed to shake his expression. She is shaking all over her body. The skeleton screamed and she yelled like she was crazy. "Sure enough, I am not wrong. I am not wrong. Sandro teacher Ronis teacher Deken old bastard you have seen it. I succeeded this is the king of the dead. He really is the king of the dead spirit. Being the king of the dead spirit is the ability to dominate the world! This is the history I promoted! Can you be accused of this fool by Hamm? Can your soul see this?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While yelling at the lich, she rushed toward Asa and she was so excited that even the magic didn’t seem to use a thin skeleton. Every time I ran, it seemed to be shaking at any time. There must be no one who wants to pay attention to her. She quickly ran to Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great king of the dead spirit, you must know who I am now? I made it by hand, you are me, it is me." Lich The hand excitedly caught Asa’s shoulder and looked a little weird. This action is not suitable for a king who dominates her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are actually the images that emerge from his own soul, but these two sides are all accompanied by the fluctuations of the Dark Star. This is not the memory of memory but the memory of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s all that I’ve seen before, I’m sure I’ll sigh heavily, but now there’s only endless emptiness in his mind, no fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's turn the garbage here into our undead followers and then go to the whistle valley to pull up the dark stars and finally board the Sandefes The top is the end of the black star inserted into the veins and then our world is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer's excitement suddenly interrupted and looked down at himself Half of the chest black star sword has pierced the bones around her chest and the dry tissue is turning into a black smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, you have been wrong from the beginning," Asa said faintly. "It's still very wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...you...I...I...I am..." Vaderina’s trembling words could not be said. The extreme fear of loss is unbelievable. All of her souls have been filled with the absolute nothingness. She feels that her soul is disappearing with this **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She already owns the magic box. As long as the hidden box is not destroyed, she can be said to be the real undead. It is a pity that she is not directly blamed for ‘death’, not fragmentation or destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the body of the lich disappeared. Only the hoe was still hanging in the air, but the fire of the soul in her eyes was finally extinguished. Soon the corpse-like head also disappeared completely. The last evidence that existed was not in the name of Vadrina. The lich has been attributed to nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only nothingness is the true eternal true immortality that is what she has been pursuing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when this huge undead ocean has calmed down completely. All the undead monsters have disintegrated countless skeleton monsters and zombies piled up on the ground into a thick layer of debris that is completely turning into dust. There is no ghost in the sky anymore. It seems that even the blackness that shrouds the heavens and the earth dissipates the sun and it seems to be strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s face is still an empty expression and walks towards the direction of the Descartes Valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wake up the kid." A sudden roar suddenly made everyone's eardrum and heart faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you forgotten who you are? You forgot what you did here?" Gru is screaming that his eyes are already red. The muscles are all stretched out and the blood vessels almost burst out. The vindictive light shimmered with his snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s footsteps still go step by step toward the direction of the Deva Valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mollier’s voice rang slowly: “He didn’t forget that he’s going to do it himself, but that substitute has changed him but I can Definitely not a magic trick or any control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. So it seems that I only have to wake you up." Sa said one word at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Talking with your fist is always the most effective way." Moriel seems to have calmed down from the excitement just now. And there is no strange syllable in her voice, and her dragon language magic is finally finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took so long that the dragon language magic did not have any earth-shattering reaction, but the body of Moriel began to slowly glow with strange blue light. The scales also gradually disappeared into a crystal-clear blue crystal. Soon the whole body of this black dragon became like this. It looked like a huge blue crystal sculpture, but she was still in the blue of the activity, and the light from the depths of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a change in the body but in the sense of everyone, this blue crystal dragon is ten times bigger than the black dragon. The breath of the black dragon is the ancient beast to let the soul feel the huge gap in power from the instinct of the creature. The horror of this blue crystal dragon makes the soul feel that it is not a gap, but the feeling of facing different things in essence. It is despair that feels directly from the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the Beast seems to have no effect. Even Lancelot and Roland can't help but squat on the ground. It's all cold sweat. This came from Longwei than just ten times stronger and it seems that Morrie deliberately did not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The top secret method of the ancient dragon on the sacred crystal dragon." Even Asa’s footsteps stopped and looked at the huge crystal dragon with empty eyes. . The scene of the scene flashed in front of the eyes. It was the memory of the Dark Star. At the peak of the shadow of 500 years ago, this huge blue crystal dragon rushed to the altar. "You just use this to defeat Akibad and they interrupted the black star."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You two also come together. Can bear my present Longwei should be able to play some role. The other wastes are going to roll, how far is it far away, you are useless here." Moriel didn't go back just to say this while mourning a little. A few syllables of dragon magic. Behind her, Lancelot and Roland's body suddenly showed a green light, and then both of them began to grow up and muscles, and even the clothes and armor of the body had signs of faintness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people who had struggled to resist Moriil Longwei immediately stood up and looked at each other with a horror. They are not the ones who have not received the auxiliary magic, but the perfection of this auxiliary magic is better than all other auxiliary magic in the world. The power in this body is so harmonious. All the physiological functions of the conscious and even conscious reactions are multiplied without any unnatural feelings as if they should have been in such a state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s swordsmanship slowly rises to the sky and is stronger and more cohesive than the sword he had gathered from all the Paladin swordsmen. Lancelot just raised his hand and pointed out that the air around Asa was in a slight smashing sound, as long as his body moved more than ten times before the sacred light cross sword would come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the gas reaction is multiplied and can be turned around, and the ultimate combat power is not doubled, nor how many times , but how many times multiplied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Asa even didn’t even look at them. His eyes only fell on Molly and Grudy. Morrill didn't add any auxiliary magic to Gru. Maybe she didn't think it might be that she couldn't even add magic to him. Gru does not seem to have the power of Roland and Lancelot, but Asa only looks at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are already many standing ups in the distant coalition. Longwei is weakening and even disappearing in the enclave, and the blue light on the body of Moriel is getting more and more prosperous. She has already condensed all the powers of blue. The radiance of the blue eyes has replaced the black breath just filled the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe this dark star is the darkness of your human beings. It's not the same as ours. This guy looks a bit strange and the former Elf King." The difference in the nature of power is not just a simple force but it makes me feel bad." The stronger the strength of the accumulation, the more prosperous. Morrier is now more and more calm, and then there is no such thing as a kind of cold and calm in the wild voice. "You two will first try it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice is still down, someone will first shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shot is not Roland or Lancelot is not Gru but two people in the back coalition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longwei has dissipated the coalition forces and as the remnants of the retreating army as Molly said, it is clear that this level of fighting is indeed not something they can participate in. It’s gone. However, there are also two leaders who have not left and are still the first to take the shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shots are the two elements of the magical masters of Glendon and Adelaide. Although they are just as soft under the Dragon of the Holy Crystal Dragon, they know this far. The distance is really the time when the magician is playing and they are also confident that they can definitely create opportunities for the people ahead even if they can't beat the king of the dead spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two early mornings, the two elements of the water and soil have been madly rushing toward Asa as they mourn the mantra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa himself did not react at all, but the sand under his feet suddenly condensed into a yellow crystal ice surface while the sand around the distance suddenly rose from the ground. Flying in the sky just in the blink of an eye, just above his head and numerous cold condenses together into a huge yellow and white icicles and then the icicles pressed down with a huge wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as the icicles, there are four sides of the ice wall that surrounds Asa. Plus the ground that condensed under his feet, now he is a scorpion. He only looks at the huge icicle above him and hammers him into meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never have a magician attacking people in such awkward ways but the two elements of the magic master are used. Because they have not forgotten that Asa is still wearing the gown of the Ghost King, which is a treasure that can immunize all magic effects. They have to be so savvy. Both of them's magical powers were completely released. In particular, Aidelide almost completely dumped a master's magical source completely without skill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such a clumsy way of magical attack, but there is no such magical attack that it is difficult to resist and difficult to resolve. Because ‘Qiao’ is a dazzling effect, it can be cracked. Just like the delicate structure, there must be a fragile place. The fine cloth must have a gap, but the '拙' can never be broken. It can only be hard and hard. Go hammer and hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the power of clumsiness. Even the completely enchanted Ghost of the Ghost has no defensive ability under this attack. Even if Asa can forcibly break through an ice wall and give Lancelot their chances to stay big enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After joining this attack, twice the Master’s mind has a faint understanding, they all feel a new realm. Just take time. Their magic level can definitely reach a new height. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s a pity that this time is bound to not be there when they get out of this magic. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The icicles are still falling and the pressure and pressure have squeezed the air below like a typhoon and is blowing the icicles in the gravity field. The Grandden Tower suddenly saw Asa look up at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandden Tower’s eyes are actually not very good, and he is now close to Asa’s full-scale ice. There is still no transparent ice in front of Asa. wall. However, he was very clear and clearly saw that Asa looked at him more than he could read with a lens. He could see clearly that even his reflection in Asa’s pupil was clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a pair of empty and incomparable eyes. He himself reflected in this endless emptiness and silence is also empty as a illusory empty. All the feelings and emotions in the body, and the magical power that is working, are nothing but illusion illusions. Disappearing emptiness...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adelaide next to him only saw that Glendon’s sudden look was a stagnation and the whole person fell apart. This magical master who was still maintaining the top magical magical moment collapsed into a ground limb and organ. But it seems that there is no bloody and cruel feeling. It seems that it is just a very fine puppet who has been evacuated. The most important thing is that he has scattered himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adelaide had no time to scream the woman’s unique instincts and she felt strange. She turned and flew. She didn't know how Granden would become like this, but she knew that the next one must be her turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as she turned around, her eyes still saw the empty eyes. The inertia made her continue to turn and the eyes slipped out of her line of sight. She could feel the hollow line of sight sliding down the neck down the neck to the chest and finally pulling over the waist. She turned and ran a few steps and seemed to suddenly think of reaching out and taking out a delivery reel from her arms but squirting it before she could open a large mouthful of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This blood is not a bit of a mouth because she has been spraying that mouth like a burst of water. The blood is mixed with large chunks of visceral muscles and even some white bones. She almost spit out her chest cavity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only forcefully pull the reel apart half of her consciousness is covered up by the emptiness of the emptiness and fear in her body. Fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Adelaide fell to the ground and the ice wall was also broken. Without the support of the magician, the ice wall could not withstand the pressure of the upper pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bang in the bang of the icy ice fragments, the huge ice technique hit a huge crater on the frozen ice ground and the tremors and tremors are like the heavens and the earth. The upper part of the icicles, which are swaying and swaying, are swaying in the upper part of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa slowly walked forward to his pace or was so unhappy and slow, his posture did not change. The icicles of the mountain were just rubbing the ice cubes that hit him in the back of the ground and the ice splatters that swept around him like rain. But none of them could hit him. He is like a virtual image of reality. No matter whether it is surrounded by the sky, he is stepping on the empty footsteps and walking in his own direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
