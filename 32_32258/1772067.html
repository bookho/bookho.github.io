			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa was awakened by the bloody smell of his body that night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already washed the clothes and replaced them. But as he lay in bed and gradually entered the sly half-sleeping position, he immediately smelled the strong bloody smell that had been swirling around the nose during the day. The sound of the ruptured muscles of the skeletal muscles screams and screams in the ear. The feeling of hand-carrying the knife in the hand and smashing into the body mixed with bloody smell into the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling once made people fall into the excitement of a primitive beast when fighting and killing - because I don't want to die, so I want you to die. But once I returned to this peaceful environment, I had a very fine meal and we had some other things to discuss and lie on the most comfortable bed in the best hotel in Brakada. Really feel that this beast-like memory is only irritating when you are still alone. The feeling of the human being and the feeling of the beast cannot be harmoniously blended into one another in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa walked out of the room to the back of the hotel. He was going to blow his hair to wake himself up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lights and shackles in the front pub are still going on. The dry air in the back garden swept from the west, and Asa felt that the breath of the plateau seemed to change. He clearly sighed comfortably. But there was a sudden vomiting sound in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance not far from the front, a person is bending over and holding the wall with one hand and covering his chest and abdomen to bury his head in vomiting. He spit very hard and tried to dump everything in his body. Even if there was nothing to vomit, he was still retching and tears screaming at his mouth and hanging down with his spit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, he seems to have exhausted his last strength and staggered. The pub turned his face into a dark red light through the lights that made the original masculinity very embarrassing. Asa sees it as Rod Hart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt also saw Asa dialing some water from the sink of the drinking horse to the face and rubbing it with his sleeves. It seems to have recovered. Point spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First killing?" asked Asa. He knows that many fighters are like this after the first kill. I am also very uncomfortable in my heart but much better than him. "Strictly speaking, those are not human."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt gasped and said, "I didn't even kill the chicken before." Today, at least kill more than a dozen big ear monsters. Silence for a long while, he said, "I grew up listening to the legends of the heroes who fought, and I have always been looking forward to the scene of the sandstorm. I used to learn swordsmanship and how to fight in the Knights’ School. I always thought about how to kill the enemy and slash the enemy's head. These are the illusory concepts in my head for many years. I have used to use 'kill' as a word. Today I am personally I finally did it, but his face was very pale. "Don't say it's an enemy. It's just a big ear. Just think that they can talk about people. In many places, they also live with human beings. It's half a person. When you were nervous, you didn't care if you came back. I clearly thought that during the day, the sword stabbed in the blood and felt that I could get something that I could talk to." He showed a painful expression and seemed to spit again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The killing is not a simple matter." Asa walked over and patted him on the shoulder. "It's good to get used to it. And you have to get used to it if you don't want to be killed." Unconsciously he moved the words of others to teach him<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for your teaching." Rodhart’s very serious wording made Asa feel uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used to imagine what justice, what heroes and what to fight in the concept. But in reality, I only use these things to beautify the story. I naively believe that the justice of justice just kills the folks. I thought I would be a fighting hero but know that killing is too difficult for me." He looked at Asa very sincerely. "I have learned from you that what I should have in reality. You saved the way I and the folks did today and solved the situation that I thought was desperate. I really admire you. It is the hero of reality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa felt that the lights in the pub were too hot, and even the glimmers that passed through them burned their faces. He would like to say something modest and realistic. There is nothing to be humble. He has to say: "In fact, I just do what I want to do." He suddenly remembered the common dwarves and people who were common in Karendo. The situation then learned how they look and tone and said: "There is no need to say if you don't give up, make a friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me a favor?" asked Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Going to the fire and not leaving," Rod Hart replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day Asa let Rodhart escorted Chris back to the king. There are really important things to do to stay here in Bracada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the key is how to do this is the problem that makes him headache. Do you want to go alone to the orc's castle and grab the book back? He still remembers how the orcs that had killed their entire team on the hills six months ago. The difference between the ogre werewolf and the big-eared monster is like a lion and a fur-skinned dog who are going to rampage and even die if they have a hundred lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no idea to rack your brains. Asa thought of the big head of the guy in Bolugan. It seems that there are still some things in it. I just went to him to help him think about it. However, the truth is that Asa can not say that the appointment document that the bishop gave him said that the book is a very important book of the church must be brought back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the same as the officials in other places. The name of the church seems to be convincing to this guy who is a creed. This also shows from the urban environment of Brakada that there is only one small church in the whole city that is as indiscriminate as those hotels. Some priests had to live in the rooms of various hotels to listen to the sacred work of the nieces and drunks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even so, Bolugan still tries to help Asa as much as he cares about the news of the orc city-state. They caught a few big ears and secretly interrogated but did not get any valuable information. These ordinary big eared monsters are not very clear about the situation of the orc city-state. It seems that only the leaders of the big ear community have made it clear that they really intend to take a few tickets here and then go there to avoid the pursuit of the human army. The property that was robbed was also gathered in the morning to send people secretly to go there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the interrogation, return to the office of the City Hall. The Bolugan adults frowned and walked around in the same place. The brows and eyebrows stood on the big eyes that seemed to be screaming at any moment, making his troubles and contemplations look evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This ridiculous rumor about the orc city-state seems to be true. Since such ridiculous things can become a reality, we might as well boldly Reasoning and imagining with the situation at hand, you may be able to look at the whole picture of things further.” He suddenly looked up and asked Asa: “What do you say they are stealing money for?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it is used." Asa felt that this was nonsense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say well. They are used for it." The great Bolugan gave high praise to Asa’s nonsense answer. "We didn't go to the bottom when we didn't confirm the news. We just thought that it was customary to think that they were robbery and extortion is the same purpose as other bandits. But we forgot that this is the last few attempts to escape human society. They are no longer dare to reappear in the empire. Then the reason they are so interested in property is that the orc’s city-state is also circulated in gold and silver as our human society. The city-states they built were not the nests of large beasts as we imagined, but a group similar to our human society in order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The average person is too I am used to seeing the beasts as beasts without mind. In fact, from many places, they are also supposed to have quite intelligent races, but only different cultural forms, so it is easy to give people such illusions. So they build one Although this kind of city state of order sounds like nonsense, it is entirely possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nodded. He believed that he had seen several different races of orcs equipped with fairly sophisticated weapons and armor. It wouldn't be a human deal that they could make themselves only to go and have the ability to make them. That is to say, at least six months ago, this matter was already in progress. Such a huge plan can completely ruin the eyes and ears of the entire empire.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not completely at least there are also the own Duke adults to know. The Duke said that it was a military secret empire that was already being processed and could not be easily disclosed to others. But now it seems obvious that it will not be the result of the empire. It is an eccentric doubt. The heart slowly rose but immediately merged with the good impression that the Duke’s adult had given him. This conflict made him feel aroused and irritated that he could not help but stop thinking. Look at the adults of Bolugan and ask, "What if this is the case?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
