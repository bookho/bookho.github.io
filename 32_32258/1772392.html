			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no sound and the sound was shattered together with the Great Hall of Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the meteor-like glare figure with the only ability to tear this dark black force hits the top and the sound does not come out of the surrounding marble construction is like The pile of ashes collapsed silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpse of the transformation of the body of the Pope was smashed into powder at the same time, and several of the sorcerers’ eyes were still shining. The magical light also disappeared together. No shockwaves were released in this collision, whether it was material magic or the air, and everything that was centered on them was smashed. The incomparable power of the two extreme opposite forces, the black breath and the white light, collide with each other, and even the power itself crushes all the tangible and intangible things around it into the finest particles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only one that has not been smashed is the shadow of the center, one black and one white. The moment of collision is as fast as the white light of the meteor stopped in the place, and the figure wrapped in black breath flew out. Everyone in the blink of an eye completely converted to each other without passing out, but thousands of people on the square felt their own. The heart shook with the impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dust is scattered over half of the bright hall has ceased to exist. The two-person collision centered on a huge semi-circle with a radius of tens of meters. Nothing else is only Gru. One person stood alone in the dust that was destroyed by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of priests and swordsmen who were in front of the main hall now have no trace of black and white, and the vacuum formed by the crushing of the air The zone took them into it and only four of them retired in time. As soon as Gru’s figure passed, Asa and Lancelot immediately grabbed Magnus and Talis, who could not move, and rushed back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the two talents can understand the consequences of the collision of these forces at a glance. Only the two of them can have such reaction and degree, and only they can see the dazzling In the glory of white, Gru punched on the chest of Javier. This new king of the dead spirit was bombarded like a cannonball. Even his body seems to have been torn apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javi is now invisible when he flies out of the place, whether the building and the trees are completely destroyed and the smashing of the straight road is extended beyond sight. It seems that it has already flown out of the Glorious Castle. The gray-black scent that had been shrouded in the Glorious Castle was gradually receding. The bodies that just stood up fell again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment of inactivity. The deafening cheers and screams of the orcs burst out, and the swordsmen and priests stood up and lost their minds. This has shown that the power of human understanding has long been the same as that of the Dark Star. Only a complete shock is brought to people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blackness on Talis’s wrist is fading. She finally sighed and looked up and looked at Asa, who pulled her over, whispered, “Why save? I?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa didn't look at it, just looking at the Pope and Lancelot and said, "Fast. Go to the present." Then he flew toward Rushing forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magnus and Lancelot nodded at the same time. The Pope also restored his mind, but his face was still as ugly as Lancelot. The performance of everyone on the square is different. The two church leaders are not excited and shocked. The face is still a gloomy to the extreme. After two noon, they did not rush forward with Asa but retreated backwards: "All personnel evacuated from the Glorious Castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Not everyone can hear their voices and even if they hear it, they may not be able to react. Lancelot and the Pope first found several large priests and bishops in the crowd and their orders quickly spread the crowd and began to spread around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the beast’s cheers have come to an abrupt end because Asa has returned and held Gru back to the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gruard’s hand that just flew to Jarwe’s hand has now become black. The original is as perfect as the essence of life. The muscles are now peat. The black, which is lifeless, is still spreading to him. Although he is still awake, his only remaining strength can only stand like that and all the vindictiveness. Both strength and vitality burned with the blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
