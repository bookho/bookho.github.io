			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day is a good day. From the morning, the sun is shining and the villagers are as high as the mood. Today they can go home safely to continue their previous life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They used all the food under the savings last night to open a celebration party. Bob Brother also took out a bucket of wine that was quietly collected for a long time. Everyone sang and danced around the campfire. Although Asa did not join them, but also can feel the simple and simple happiness and attachment to their home. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, the villagers took the young and brought all the things they could bring to the grassland in the east to prepare for the pardon and tax-free gift. The imperial minister said that it is necessary to see that I can be forgiven so everyone is going to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt kept saying how the imperial minister was so noble and knowledgeable. It is said that he is an aristocratic scholar who is famous in the king for academic research in the seminary and has written several books on faith and theology. These completely made Rodhart admire the five bodies. And because of his good offices, such a great man is out of the predicament and the dilemma of the villagers is also solved. Such extraordinary achievements have made his excitement last from yesterday to today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the woods, walking for a long time. As soon as noon, Asa and the villagers walked out of their woods and walked to the grass that the imperial minister appointed to wait for them to be there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the grass, Asa saw the lost forest in the mouth of the old man across the grass. It was only at first sight that he was completely determined that he was the place he was looking for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be a forest that is somewhat different. The trees are tall and the other trees around the old-fashioned style seem to automatically give the forest a distance to leave a piece of grass in the middle. The entire forest has a strange and strong atmosphere that is awesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closer the feeling is, the more obvious it becomes and the more strange it is. Asa can even feel that the entire forest is rejecting him. No malicious, but there is a heavy and majestic momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting closer to Asa, this is a very huge and majestic forest. Every tree needs at least a few talents to hold it together. The curved large trees and branches show the endless quaint and magnificent forests. The mists that are leaking from the branches and leaves together form a slanting light column cut in the middle of the gauze. There was no bird in the forest called the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't be near here. Asa seems to hear that the whole forest is silently shouting. It’s so close that he can feel the sense of deterrence almost even on his skin. Asa remembered the hunter Levin, the analogy that sounded puzzling at the time. It seems to be incomparable. It is indeed like a huge majestic ancient giant. Looking down, you dare not approach or even think back to this huge majesty. It is all a kind of pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it here? The whispering of the forest." Asa said almost to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the whisper of the slang." It seems that many people replied in a whispering voice at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa turned back and saw the villagers have long stopped their steps and stood in the middle of the grass in a pile of standing and no one looked at it. This strange voice is from a person not far from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a man in a red robe, and as far as Asa is standing facing the mysterious forest in front. The red robes seemed to be as if Asa was wearing the hunchback scorpion as much as possible to cover every part of the body. But the difference is that his face is still outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks like a face that can be seen everywhere on the street, and there are also expressions, eyes are also very shiny, but Asa feels this The face is not commensurate with the strange smell of his whole person. There were thousands of dead venomous snakes under the face and robes. It seemed to be a dangerous smell with a corpse smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to go in?" The red robe asked with his strange voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Asa answered with caution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red robes don’t seem to care much. He still looks at the depths of the forest and says, “Don’t worry, I’ll take you in for a while.” He The voice is not big, but it seems that it is very hard to get out of the throat. It seems that thousands of people are wailing at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villagers did not notice the situation on the side of Asa. They subconsciously did not look at the forest side. Even if they thought about it, they couldn’t see it, but the exact sense of rejection immediately turned them back and didn’t even talk about the interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now they are also focusing on their own affairs. A rumbling hoof sounded from the forest by dozens of cavalry. "The imperial adult is here." Rod Hart saw that one of them was imperial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How are so many people?" Hunter Levin watched as the cavalry were afraid of being armed with armor and sword. "It won't be"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. The imperial adult has already said that he wants to forgive everyone. How can he who has the identity and knowledge to go out? I was disturbed by you, of course, I have to dare to come with a guard." Rodhart is helping everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the group of cavalry is obviously not just the guardian’s meaning. They rushed to the villagers and rushed to the villagers and then spread out in a circle to make two or three Ten villagers were surrounded in the middle. Then the imperial minister and a fat man like an official walked over the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is going on with the imperial adult?" asked Rod Hart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The knight you can come out." The imperial minister nodded to him. Rod Hart went over. "Looking at your noble character and good education, you can not pursue the sins you and the gangsters know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt carefully Q: "Then they"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial minister said naturally: "Nature is going to be executed." The villagers screamed when they heard this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you promised to forgive them." Rodhart said in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial minister has raised his finger very well and raised his head with a voice of superiority: "This is wisdom. If I don’t say that they will Let me go? I was not really pledging to just exercise a brilliant strategy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official fat man is admiring the five-body The tone sighed and said: "Adults such a strategy is too great for you. If you go to the battlefield, you must be an invincible general. You are such a martial artist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The imperial minister smiled and nodded and said modestly: "I am just a scholar. A scholar is not suitable for killing and killing. When you talk about the pillars, you can count it. I have inspected so many places here. It is one of the best and the construction of the chapel shows that your devotion to God is also certain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yesterday you also saw that they all apologize to you for acknowledging I have made my own mistake. This is not to say that they are still It is kind of civilians? "Rod Hart knees pleading. Expectations and reality are just the opposite. This change in flight makes him totally unacceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I certainly remember. As a reward for their apology, I will also kill them at the same time to save them the pain of losing their loved ones. Know the punishment of the pagan village It is generally the first time that the child is first executed to let those who are disrespectful to the gods feel the greatest pain in the soul to wash their ugly soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I heard that this method is for adults. Are you sure?" The fat man asked very respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the imperial minister is overflowing with a smug look. “This is what I thought when I was studying books from the seminary. Let the pagan souls feel the painful baptism when they are alive, so that they can redeem their sins as soon as possible in hell.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man squeezed the fat on his face into a flattering smile and praised: "You are too kind and too wise."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt’s voice has already been a little crying. "But they are not infidels. Didn't I explain the real situation to you yesterday?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial minister has been somewhat impatient. "They are not yet in the future? They have come to kidnap a minister for some money and food. It’s completely unremarkable in the eyes. And I have already investigated it clearly." He pointed to the side next to him in the majesty of the judge. The fat man said. "They are completely smearing the incorruptible local official. The Dato's people impose a small tax on the people to build a chapel in the city. This is a feat for God. They are not only not The surrender of this glorious tax is also so devout to the great people who have said that they have no God's teaching and gratitude in their hearts. My theological expert has distinguished that such souls are the most easily tempted by the devil. They have not yet It is the best way for them to become a pagan before serving the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
