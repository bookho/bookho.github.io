			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty strange figures in the sky at dusk in the highlands are lined up in a queue. These figures have a head and neck lion-like body that is much thicker than the common eagle. It has four or five meters wide wings and sits on it. It is the famous Griffin Knight of Elazia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the Griffin Cavaliers looked at the sunset in the distance and yawned. He is calculating whether he is going to steal a lazy and go to sleep this evening. In the dark night sky, riding a gryphon on the cold wind over the plateau is not a comfortable thing. Although no one dares to say that the military discipline of the Erasian Griffin troops is scattered, but now it is really impossible to beat the spiritual patrol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church's coalition forces have gone deep into the wild for half a month. Except for the contact temptations between some of the reconnaissance units, there is no unexpected bloody battle with the orc troops. It seems that time is a problem for the various car coalition forces to drive straight into the city of Oufu from all directions. Although the generals of the commanding department became more cautious later, the officers and soldiers below did start to relax or loosen more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They seem to have a reason to relax. Strategically speaking, the total number of joint troops in various countries is 100,000. The number of orcs in the city of Oufu is estimated to be no more than six or seven thousand. The force gap of more than ten times has already filled all soldiers with confidence. As for the reasons why the officials seem to be more confident, Oufu has been relying on trade to trade food with neighboring countries, and the neighboring countries have already stopped trading in Europe. The barrenness of the wild highlands is unknown. The people who have been to Oufu are not in the minority. They can all testify that there are not enough grain fields and pastures for the werewolf and ogre amazing food. Without sufficient food security, no matter how strong the troops are, the powerful combat power is no shortage of rice. No matter how the orc city-owner is trying to become famous in the big 6, it is impossible for a large group of orc soldiers to be dizzy and to maintain a strong fighting power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual response of Oufudi from the start of the wilderness is also a mess. The two-legged dragons, which were originally sneaked into the weapon, seem to have no effect in front of the Griffin Knights. Although the powerful fighting power of the Wyverns is far above the Griffins, the number of Griffin Knights is far from the Wyvern. Above. And in the years of fighting with the eagle of Nigan. The cooperation and tactical literacy of the Griffin Knights has long been tempered. In the first contact battle between the wilderness and the Orc Reconnaissance Force, the ten Griffin Knights smashed a two-legged dragon with a subtle match. Since then, the Wyvern Dragon has never been in contact with these same air forces. The air superiority that had been controlled by Oufu has only been taken over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erasia has long been reluctant to expose the true strength of her Griffin forces to other countries and this time seems to express respect for His Majesty the Pope. Almost all the griffins were sent to the battlefield. More than two hundred lions and the gryphon knights on the battlefield had an extraordinary effect on the battlefield. Whether it is the animal Lasia or the other believers, the officers are very determined. They know that the control of the air superiority means the absolute superiority and absolute tactical initiative in reconnaissance. The party that has mastered the air superiority will be in reconnaissance. Tactical arrangements and strategically have a great advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sneak attack of the orc troops that have always been worrying has not been born. The reconnaissance orcs with small stocks are constantly being defeated by the Griffin Knights, but the alertness of these orcs. And the level of fierceness is also surprising. There is no way to catch a living is not a small regret. In such a good situation, the morale of the coalition forces is unprecedentedly high because it is true that the victory is already in the bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that is unexpected is that the biggest problem so far is actually inside the coalition itself. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all the soldiers below have high morale. The shrine knights and several generals who are responsible for the supreme commander show extraordinary caution. They did not take advantage of this great advantage and the high soldiers drove straight into the country. Instead, they used the safest and most rigorous way to enter the camp. The various units must maintain mutual support and echo. At any time, a large number of troops escorted the grain road as the most conservative. The old man is step by step, step by step, and steady. It seems that he will not take a step forward without stepping on a footprint on the rocks of the wild highlands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cautious is a good thing, but excessive cautiousness seems to be a bit of a bad morale, especially when this kind of careful stereotype becomes more obvious and even evolves to make the soldiers a bit Can not accept the point. Since yesterday, the Supreme Command has issued the order for the troops to march in the daytime to rest on the night. This is the reason for the most effective prevention of the night attack of the orc troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The command of the Knights of the Shrines began to violently with the dissatisfaction that had been suppressed. In particular, this dissatisfaction is not only from the soldiers, but also more difficult to solve when the officers who know the strategy and tactics. Although the Knights of the Temple spent a lot of effort to gather morale and reduce dissatisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Knights of the Shrine do not have any confusion on the command, the big troops are still using the safest and most adaptable security method in the European way, but it is a lazy and exhausted atmosphere that has been scattered in the army. opened. In addition to the Griffin Knights, there are still things that can do this imposing expedition in the hearts of soldiers and most generals who have been tempted to succumb to a boring march. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two shadows suddenly appeared in the evening glow of the evening. The captain of the gryphon knight suddenly shouted: "All attention to the battle formation. It is the beast's feet." Flying Dragon.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Griffin Knights noticed it, they were not nervous. It’s just two two-legged dragons that they have enough to handle. Sure enough, the two Wyverns are no longer close to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vice captain is a combat mage. This is also the most powerful part of the Griffin Knight. The mage who can attack in the air is definitely the nightmare of the soldiers and the best weapon for any flying enemy. He looked at the two bats and looked at the captain. "What are these beasts doing? Do we simply take the initiative to kill them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The captain thought for a moment. Shaking his head and sighing: "Is it the last time that Edric was not specifically to give us instructions? It is absolutely strictly forbidden to be tempted by the orcs. Even if we catch up, we will kill the two dragons without any damage. Go back and wait. I am afraid that it is not a reward but a punishment. I see that the orcs are just observing us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war mage took a sip and said: "Fucking We are surrounded by killing one side. It’s so timid and afraid of the tail. Is there no masculinity?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t say that you didn’t see it Has the last time someone deliberately exposed both hands in front of everyone? It is really convincing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The spirit and combat power are two different things. The real military atmosphere is not those The guys who nest in the prayer room all day can have it.” The vice captain seemed to suddenly wake up to something. Overwhelming his head and frowning like a secret telling a terrible secret, "Hey, think about Celeste... There should be no brothels. You said they would really..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain slammed into the battle mage. He is a devout believer. No one is allowed to be so arrogant. But he just opened his mouth and wanted to scream and scream. He saw a flower with a foot and a stalk of the eye from the lion's chest and pierced the man and the mount together. The War Mage's sorrow with his lion's sorrow was thrown down to the ground with one person and one beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain yelled, but he just opened his mouth and shot the same huge arrow on his face with a half-slap-sized arrow directly to his Half of the head was cut down. The headless body swayed and continued to make a sound. It was already impossible to tell whether it was a command or an exclamation of screaming. This sprayed blood and pulled it on the back of the gryphon. The white objects in the red blood and floating base immediately dyed the beautiful yellow fur of the raptor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Griffin seems to feel the death of the owner screaming and screaming at the far-footed Wyvern. The excitement of the other knights in the team immediately turned into a roaring squad of the whole team, and the lions and knights all rushed to the two long-legged dragons. Although the commander has lost, the role of anger and fighting spirit is more motivating than any impending approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, they know that it’s impossible for two Wyverns to be the opponents of more than twenty Griffin Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the two-legged dragons saw the Griffin Knight flying and immediately turned around and flew back. But not flying far away, the two-footed dragon flew out two equally huge arrows to shoot two gryphon knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Griffin Knights are even more angry and chasing. But the degree of the two-legged dragon is no different from the griffin. No matter how much they chase the distance between the two sides, the distance between the two sides can not be shortened. At some interval, the arrow is shot from the back of the biped dragon. The huge arrow was only shot from the Wyvern and the same as a lion's lion and the lion's pheasant. When they cut off the half of a gryphon's wings, they finally got it wrong. Under the command of several seasoned warriors, all the Griffin knights began to withdraw from the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, the two Wyverns who had been escaping in the past also began to lose their heads from the escapist to the chaser. The Griffin Knights finally felt the panic because they flew back as they chased themselves. How far is it that the orcs on the Wyvern can also shoot as many times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces of the Knights and the generals of the Eliasian army are not good. On the ground is a lion's corpse with the knight's body. A huge long arrow of rice is just taken out of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilskai took this arrow with his usual arrow and looked at it. Said: "This is not the only thing that the bow can make out of the car to get out of the ground. The arrow also uses a silver thread to sculpt the magic array. Not only strengthens the penetration and destructive power, but the most important thing is to influence the air. It is reduced to a minimum. The production of the arrow is also very precise and professional. It guarantees that the arrow's straight-range range can cost no less than fifty steel swords. Therefore, it can reach the horror range beyond two miles." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A general of Erasia immediately said: "The cost of training a Griffin and Griffin Knight from an early age can definitely create a thousand good The steel swords. And within an hour. We lost forty-nine lions and gryphon knights, and the squad leader who sent them all killed, but they are the most experienced fighters. Without their gryphon forces At least half of it must be clear at a glance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lion patrols patrolling in all aspects were attacked at the same time. The way the orcs were used was the same. Shooting in the team Long. Lack of commanding people to advance and retreat naturally if not because they are all clear-minded warriors. Seeing the situation is not right to know that the loss is only greater."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Wilska frowns: "The captains of the Griffin team must wear different clothes from the players to facilitate the enemy to aim?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No way The battle in the air can be no more than the tacit cooperation between the ground and the commanding or the commanding of many times when the sound is not transmitted. The distance between each other is sometimes inconspicuous. So the captain’s Clothes suits must be different in order to ensure the operation of tactics and formations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really doubt what kind of brakes are within two miles. Can there be such precision? Even if there is such precision, how can I aim? If it is you, I will believe but those barbaric orcs..." Another general of Erasia hesitated and turned to ask Wellskai. He once saw the arrow skill displayed by the Knight of the Temple. He couldn't believe that the barbaric sub-humans could reach that level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilska shook his head and said indifferently: "There has been no need to doubt anything that has already been born. I believe that there is enough for the craftsmanship of the dwarf craftsman." This kind of precision winch with the arrow of the orc's power is absolutely destructive enough. If it is about vision... even if I don't dare to compare it with the lizard, my eyes can't grow like them. In vitro, it can be adjusted automatically and then after a long period of special training, so they can do it without any doubt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The distance between the two is not to mention the Griffin The knight's smashing arrows are absolutely impossible to attack even the battle mage's spells. They keep this distance and take the tactics of the two-legged dragons and the lizard manipulating tactics to take over the air. The strength and volume advantage of the dragon is swaying and the advance and retreat will not chase the top of our army. Let our guns and magicians have a chance to let the ten-footed dragon completely suppress me. "The Griffin Knights?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A staff member thought about it and said, "Let the magician and the squadron sneak in front and then lure them with the griffon." Flying into the sky suddenly raided. How about this plan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can you lurk in that impossible?" One immediately responded that he was stationed on the edge of the eastern highlands. The ability of the orcs is clear. "Their sights are not limited by the night. No matter how you send troops, they can see it clearly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aidelik turned his head Erske said: "Tomorrow we can attack together and we can have no effect on us. Just try to take the initiative to kill the ten-footed dragons on our side."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two adults may be the intention of Oufu." The young Templar on the side suddenly spoke before he kept talking and looked at the table quietly. The sandbox listened to the conversation between the generals and the Knights of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aidelik frowned and asked him, "What do you mean? Jia Wei Samurai."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Javi Samurai nodded and replied with a very plain voice: "I think that since Oufu can plan such a fine and effective tactic, then how do we deal with this tactic must also be in their plan. For such a long-range airborne sniper sniper There are only powerful individual tactics that can crack this point. We don’t know if we want to get the people from Oufu. I think in their eyes, the life of Wellskey and Adelik may be more than the entire gryphon team. Value..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
