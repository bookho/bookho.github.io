			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue figure has just moved around the Templars and all the priests have mourned the prayers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These guards who send the magic array are the elites of Celeste. Even if they have just been shocked by the murderous murder, they are absolutely fast enough. But in the Templar, the sword was pulled out, but in the blink of an eye, more than a dozen people have become broken bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the sword is pulled out, it seems to have no effect. The only old martyr who had the highest martial arts could puncture the half-sword toward the flying figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The degree of the figure has been more than the naked eye of the surrounding people. Only the old Templar can withstand the sword with many years of magical skills. . But it was only a half-sword. Because of this feeling, he had just stabbed the instinct that he had been practicing in the battlefield and killing for many years. He immediately took it back and rolled it to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instinct and feeling honed between countless battles and life and death is already the fastest response of the human body, but the quick response is impossible. Make up for the gap in strength. The warrior who stabbed the half-sword even fled in half and then his upper body flew out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue transmission of light has dissipated and replaced by a stronger white half-light. The radiance is dazzling white but in all eyes that can be seen, it is more than any black or scarlet. It gives birth to fear from the depths of the soul. It represents the death that represents the light of killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White vindictive ray flies around the magic circle as a swordsman priest who is holding a storm and is blown up like shredded paper The flesh and blood of the sky sprinkled like rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Glorious Castle, there is no such thing as a pastor trainee pastor who can see this scene. The magicians were all shocked and immediately used the magic dozens of light arrows and fireballs to splatter like a rainstorm. But these low-middle-level magics haven’t even really hit the white light above the small white snow like a tiny snowflake that can’t be blown up. The wind pressure and momentum of the movements of the <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all these magical blows are broken and broken. disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is not only the broken limbs, the flesh and blood, the huge and fierce, the murderous, the murderous and the murderous. There have been magic apprentices and wind priests scared to the ground. This is clearly in the Glorious Castle but they all feel like a different world of purgatory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A huge white lightsaber came from the direction of the shining temple. The same white light, the white light of the lightsaber is a grand, calm and inclusive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword has not reached the ground of this sword. The ground has already cracked a deep trench in the sword air on the cracked marble floor. Was wrapped in the sword. Like a condensed god for thousands of years, the thunder rumbled to the raging storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole glorious castle has trembled with a loud bang and a sword of light while dispelling the weaker priests and magicians around the blast. Was thrown away. Two people in the center of the explosion retire one person and refraction around the glory of the armor. Another person is naked and bare-handed. It is Gru and Lancelot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s just the turn of this round. But both of them have done their best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want?" Lancelot screamed at the intersection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not difficult to get the reel of the Glorious Castle by means of Cedros. Lancelot and the Pope have long been wary of individual soldiers like Gru Sharp and sudden assassination. And as the core of the church is only for the majesty of Celeste. It is also impossible to shut down the magical array in order to guard against a group of orcs in the middle of the class, so Lancelot will try to leave the Glorious Castle as little as possible. As long as there is a person who can compete with Gru, Gru can only be sent to death. After all, there are thousands of swordsmen and pastors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don’t think Gru actually came. And this is murderous. This is not just a surprise assassination, but what is bigger and more horrible behind the scenes. Lancelot feels it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to hell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru's words are simple. Then he took out a small object from his arms. It seems that a jade ornament bends and raises this little thing with a sharp air and a high air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not throw this thing to Lancelot or to anyone, but to the upper sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the power of his hand, this thing has reached a height of several kilometers above the line of sight of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot’s face instantly became whiter than paper. Although he didn’t feel it, he could guess what it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face is changed or Stephen, he has already arrived with Inham, not far away. He is now looking at the sky that has nothing to see: "The idiot of Asri is the only finished product that we have spent countless energy and the top sorcerer..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inham's face There is no change. He seems to have long expected that this life is all the same. He also looked at the high-altitude face with some satisfactory smiles. The same playwright saw his own script being staged by the most famous star in the Royal Theatre. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can see where the little thing flies. The only thing that can be seen is that the sky is dark and the sky is dark and red. The huge clouds are slowly emerging in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Concord cloud is very heavy and heavy. It seems that it is not a cloud. A large group of red-hot rocks hang in the sky and the center of the clouds gradually appears to be a whirlpool. The roar of the mix has huge magical fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burning dark red giant fireball is drilled from the vortex and then falls down the ground with a slanted red flame tail. In the glorious castle on the ground, everyone who was screaming at the place where the fireball fell was screaming and fleeing to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a loud bang in the castle. It’s like a person who has been pinned. It’s not the volatility of the explosion. It’s not falling. The magical condensed fireball is a hill-like weight weighing tens of thousands of pounds plus the drop of the height of several kilometers and the high temperature flame wrapped around it has heated the temperature of the rock to a near melting point. Instantly blown up, nothing can withstand such a blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is not in the air, the red clouds are roaring in the whirlpool of more and more clouds, and then the fireball falls down. This time it’s not just It is not a three-piece, five-seven-seven-seven, but dozens of dead rains that slammed into the fire and destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most powerful of all curses. It’s not only the top mana that combines the fire and the other, but also the only one of the forces of the gas and space. The four series of magical curse meteor fire and rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a magical amount to release this curse, you can turn the magic power of the four top mages back to the apprentice level. And this is the first meteor fire and scroll in history. Even with the top mages of the Descartes Valley, it has spent countless efforts and gems, and finally made some fortune scrolls with some luck. Esri is carried by the most powerful and even sacrificed a lot of magical power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the necromancer wizards made this thing more for a hobby of magic than for practicality. This magical power is of course almost irresistible, but the application time is long enough to deal with the castle. It seems that the style and strength of the Necromancers will never use this thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now this most powerful curse has finally got the most powerful place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strategic destruction of the Glorious Castle is a building that will only completely irritate all the religious countries without any room for manoeuvre. The center of the church is here but the power is not. So Sedros has kept this secret weapon that was accidentally acquired unused. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, Oufu has long stopped thinking about what strategy and tactics are left to destroy the battle simply for revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty fire meteors are rolling down with flames, no matter how glorious castles are, and then strong defenses, strong and high-ranking swordsmen and magicians, but in this power The biggest curse is also like an ant. After all, manpower cannot compete with the power of this near heaven and earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
