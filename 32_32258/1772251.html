			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your heart is already messed up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cup shakes the tea in the cup in midair It has also begun to overflow in the sloshing. Stephen looked at Sandrew faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru did not move his face indifferently like ice sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are as full of hostility and impetuousness as the young guys. Under such circumstances, do you think you are the opponent of both of us?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably not." Sandru thought for a moment and finally replied faintly. Although he replied in this way, the magical fluctuations in his body are still tumbling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then sit down and have a cup of tea." Stephen's hand raised the cup in front of Drew's face and floated up. Neither he nor the end of the mountain did not have the slightest murderousness until this time is completely indistinguishable from the two ordinary old men who advised friends to drink tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru is a slight glimpse: "I really want to sit down and drink tea? Don't you both come to deal with me?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that these two people are not able to deal with his poison in the tea but he knows they won’t. Perhaps other people in this world may poison him but the two alone will not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not based on what kind of friendship and trust, and he and the two are completely different. He can be so sure because the two men are truly worthy of their title, the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if they want to maintain the inexhaustible iron in the Descartes Valley, they may indeed be able to fight with him, but they will never use this method. Therefore, letting him drink tea in this situation, whether it is imposing, mentality or strength, is to say that they really just want him to sit down and drink tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To deal with you? Sander, you really disappointed me..." Shant tried to sit up straight. Watching Sandro cough and say intermittently. “Don't you forget what is the most important thing for a Necromancer?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is flat and slowly mixed in the coughing sound, which makes people not listen It’s clear, but the whole body is filled with murderous and magical, and Sandro’s body is tight and stagnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephen took another cup of tea from the side of the stone chair and said to him, "I can see that your heart is stuffed with something." And it’s full. You are not just looking for that guy because of yourself. There are other reasons. Others are not for your own reasons. You have some involunts and even the hostility in your chest can’t be suppressed. Man as your enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru turned to look at Stephen. The light in the eyes is colder than the previous one. It is still a little dazzling. He sneered and said: "I don't know if your eyes are so good, even I can see through. How? Do you think you have seen through?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Stephen doesn’t seem to care about this vision or even care too much about Sandro. He leaned back on the back of the chair and began to look around slowly. The eyes around the clouds in the surrounding mountains and the clouds flowed across his eyes. The eyes were very casual and soft. "Where can I see you? I just remember that you seem to I didn’t look at the surroundings after I came in. The beautiful place of Deya Valley, I’ve come back, I’ve seen it for a whole day, I haven’t seen it enough for you, but I’m not seeing it for 20 years. It only shows that your heart is blocked by something. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru looked at his eyes and slowly let go. I didn't feel that I also looked around with Stephen's. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning sun is swaying from the highest point of the shadows and the business of this beautiful piece of land in the valley is full of business. The exotic flowers and plants are planted in a very artistic way. In every place in the valley, there are three or four thick and lush trees scattered in a mountain stream where a pool of green water is accumulated. There is a rockery that is integrated with the environment. Looking at this scene from different angles has a different aesthetic. The Necromancer who designed and planted the vegetation in this valley was known to the world in the world, but his name is the most famous garden artist of the 6th and they are all gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone benches and stone chairs placed in the shade of the trees or on the edge of the pool are all hand-carved by the Necromancers. Every single piece is enough for the most discerning art collector to be crazy now floating in front of Sandru this cup is also true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
