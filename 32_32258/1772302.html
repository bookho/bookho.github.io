			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am responsible for the death of this ogre warrior. It is my intention. I did not notice that this is actually an old bull." "The werewolf who made the magic with a weird long knife came over. Although it was a wolf's face, he still could see that he was heavy. His words are round and round, which is very different from the accent of other werewolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of thing is inevitable, Luke’s captain, you don’t need to be too self-blaming. You must know that you have to kill such a bully king at least. It is the people of the church's shrine knights who can go deep into this swamp hunting. You come with me." Bolugan adults waved their hands and turned to go outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are basically a lot of bulls that can be captured in this area. Do you want to continue?" Luken asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course continue. But in another direction, you can't go deep into the swamp. If you are not going to provoke the Hydra, let's get used to it." You don't have to be responsible for it. Wei has just accepted the position of the tribal leader. He will lead 20 elite ogre warriors to take over here tomorrow. Today, I will order all the rest.” The main assistant of the city of Oufu is struggling with a deep foot. The ground walks in the swamp and jumps on it. Although the ogre and the sorcerer have already opened up a avenue, the rough work is only for the convenience of transporting cattle and supplies, and there are still sewage sludge stumps everywhere. It is harder to walk than the original swamp in the shape of the Bolugan adults. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that it is my responsibility to have casualties in these two days, but I hope that the city of Cydlos will give me another chance to prove it, my captain He will never let him down." Luken stood still and watched the adult of Bolugan. Bolugan’s adult cracked his mouth and smiled. He could only shoot on the lower back of the tall werewolf. "Stupid. Not dissatisfied with your work here, there is something more important for you to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, what?" Werewolf Captain The light in the eyes is bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The city of Cedros has invited several elemental magicians from the Tower of the Tooth. Officially intends to begin teaching the magic of the children in the city, you have to go When the chief instructor heard that the magicians had just heard that they were to teach the magic of the orcs, they were astonished to hear the eggs and eat people. If it wasn’t for the relationship between the city of Cedros and their relationship, they took a few The best magic gems make those guys drool, and the self-righteous old bastards really won't come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magicians are all high and self-righteous. The werewolf captain smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They think that the Werewolf Ogre Half-orc causes the barbaric race to be forever with the mysterious magic, so you have to give them a good demonstration, magic It’s not their human patents.....” When he said that he was here, he was awkward and had been a high-ranking official in the orc’s city-state. It seems that I don’t know myself as a human being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the orcs learn magic somewhat differently from humans. The spiritual concentration of meditation and the ability to understand the mantras are indeed a little different from humans. We can hardly learn spells." Luken nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The key point is not how many years it takes to train a few Orc Masters. The key is to let magic learning begin in the city of Europe in a year or two. Popularity. You know that magic gems and the like are not missing, huh, huh. As long as you master some basic meditation magic release techniques, we are enough for everyone to have the ability to release magical magic.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, huh. Luken also cracked his mouth and covered his mouth with a grin, and raised his huge hand to grasp the grip. He had four rings of fine magic jade on his hand. He even considered whether he should see the magicians. Take these away, so that the hearts of the old man can't afford it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Pope can't have four of them that will be used as magic power savings and magic. The magical jade ring of the increase. This kind of thing is enough to make the heartbeat speed in front of any magician, let alone four, the most crucial thing is to set him in such a werewolf hand who only uses some intermediate magic. The meaning is not to use the most gorgeous silk fabrics for the farmer's farmers to sweat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a large number of magic mines brought back from the Sandefes Mountains. In order to prevent the mainland's magical commodity value system from collapsing, Cedros only released a small amount in exchange for a large amount of money and resources, and other nature was reserved for his own use, but Oufu can now use magic in addition to the plug. De Adams just outside the only way a willing it, so he only comparable to that Avandia Valley mages equipment <br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"Good title...." There was a bitter smile on the werewolf's face. "I must go all out." The wide front is parked with only two-legged dragons. Bolugan and Luken and the half-orc adjutant boarded the dragon to leave. It didn't take long before the swamp came out. I came to a large field that was transformed with a swamp. Many big ears were busy in the field. The two-legged dragons carried the new Oufu orc instructor back to Oufu to accept the appointment of Cedrus. The Bolugan adults stayed here. In a short time, two orcs and the orcs took the account information and reported to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Today, 30 acres of new land have been opened, a total of 590 acres. According to the budget, the total income of berries and tubers next month can be Reaching more than 300,000 pounds, and then next month can be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The map of the swamp is brought." The fingers snapped a finger. The half-orc adjutant immediately took out a piece of parchment from the large pocket of his waist. His biggest role was to help the city's assistants carry all kinds of information, even though the owner of the city's assistant had enough things in his head. However, from the current development situation, it may be possible for the adjutant to be replaced by an ogre. The Bolugan adults looked at the map of the swamp, and the cockpit-like head swayed. Said:. "Temporarily stop the reclamation of new land, these is enough" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "But adults, our seeds and manpower are still enough, you can then reclaim two hundred . mu production so we can mention ...... "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" producing so much to do you endure it "dry Bolu adults? The bull's eye turned over. "This kind of production is enough to raise the cattle and Kodo animals, and there are already food and pasture highlands. Although these plants grow short, the soil consumed should be very strong, and the farmland must be replaced within half a year. Let these used arable land be restored for a few years. If you cultivate too much at one time, you will end up with only the land that can be planted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whatever it is Even if you are farming, you should put your eyes on the long-term perspective. Don't just stare at the front, do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloogan adults squat. The Orc was much shorter than the Werewolf, and he was half-bent in front of him. This time he finally took a successful shot on the Orc's forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is the situation at the training ground?" Bolugan asked another half-orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When...there was a supply of oxen's body during this time, sitting on a wolf, a clear-winged dragon, and the two-legged dragon also included two meats than the Mongolian The question is considering whether it is going to make the wolf breed in large quantities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are so many wolves coming out, then the bulls are no longer caught, then What does the wolf eat? Eat you? For the same reason, these bulls are temporary materials that cannot be considered as sustainable resources. From today, the bodies of the cattle are all shipped back to Oufu,<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emergency treatment into meat and dry food storage. But Kodo animal this kind of thing to breed and breed, whether as meat or transportation tools are not too much. Also, difficult The number of domesticated bulls must be increased, but don't make it hard, be sure to <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More ways to use, can come up with effective ways to improve There is a big reward for domestication and speed. Force is not the most important, efficiency is, understand?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I know." The Orc admired and nodded and retreated. After more than a year, the city's assistants were in a much higher position in their eyes than the ones themselves. Each of these tips is really insightful. The wind of the swamp blew through, and the large areas of the fields in front of the green fields shook their heads in the dazzling sunshine with the heads of the Bolugan adults. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the data that I have just heard, the feelings in the head of Oufucheng’s main assistant are as vibrant as the good field in front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you give me another, no, give Oufu three years, and all the countries on the mainland will no longer dare to smash this wild land. There are another ten years. It is definitely the strongest country in the history of the mainland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way to build a city with one hand and one foot, the feeling of a country is really great. Now this Oufu, whether it is from the scale of weight, or let him show his hands and feet, is more than a few times more than the small town of Bracada he managed, and the sense of accomplishment is naturally countless times. Standing in the wind, he only feels passionate in his chest. If this can have a very powerful cloak on his back, he laughs a few times, and he feels that he is completely a legendary great man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
