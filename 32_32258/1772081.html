			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assah woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the oil lamp on the haystack table at the wall of the hotel room that still keeps the look of the night. I was lying on the bed that she was sleeping on, and on the hay-woven pillow that she had used, although it should have been a long time, but it still felt like the smell of the above. The sunshine and the noise outside the window are coming in. This is the morning of Oufu. Asa feels very brisk and feels very good and has never been better. The muscles and muscles of both hands are so powerful that the skin is also full of healthy elasticity and complexion. The mind is soberly awake and the voices of every orc outside are clearly distinguishable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get out of the hotel's door. The highland morning sun is so light that you can penetrate the body. The beasts on the street are busy talking and talking. The half-orc boss who is screaming at the invigorating sights of the hotel is sitting at the door and cutting the unpalatable tubers in his hand. It seems that there are a group of businessmen coming. He wants Busy for a while. The city is full of vitality and peace. Asa shook his head hard and shook his head. The bloody fear in memory when he was awake was like a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory of some of the pieces fluttered from somewhere in my mind. In that half-dead time, although he can't move, he can still vaguely know what is happening around him. Although I don't fully remember, I know that everything has been restarted. The people around you are no longer the enemy that was misunderstood or the enemy. It’s just that I’m alone in a strange city and I’ve got a strange sense of loneliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The owner of Sedros asked you to go to the City Hall to find him after he woke up. He has something to say to you." The Orc boss looked up at him and glanced at him. Just lower your head and continue to concentrate on the food on your hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? Oh." Asa nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to the City Hall The city of Cedros is holding a meeting with the elders of various tribes. Asa is waiting in the city hall. There is still such a busy half-orc and human officials who talk to each other and hold some official comments. There are also a few ogres werewolf lizards in the meantime. The sounds of various languages ​​and the appearances of each other are mixed and intertwined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Gru came in from the gate with a few werewolves and ogres. These orcs are wearing weapons and armor. It seems that he is the fighting force led by him. General Gru only looked at him and then nodded to him and took the orcs and walked into another conference hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked at Gru and couldn’t help but nod. Is this the horrible enemy in that last memory? He suddenly remembered a story: Someone sleeps in the mountains and made a dream down the mountain. Now the time has passed and the world has completely changed. And now he feels like he has done such a dream for hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world has changed. So what about her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting is finally over. The main face of Cedros City with a smile came out of the conference hall and asked Asa to beckoning. Asa followed him to the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have she gone back?" After listening to the story of the city of Cedros, Asa just said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros nodded and said, "Go back to her. Go home and get married."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The word 'self' sounds particularly harsh. Asa didn't know if it was Sedlock's intention to express it or to listen to it. He felt that the chest seemed to be hit by something from the inside. It was very painful, so stuffy and sour, and even felt like shaking himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are your plans?" Cedrus looked at him and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa has no expression on her face. The street still seems to be so lively and peaceful. All kinds of orcs and humans walked by and yelled and said. But these noisy things seem to be just phantoms, as if they are too far away to be completely unrelated to themselves. He is just walking step by step. Sedros looked at him and didn't talk to him just to accompany him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally he sighed and said: "I want to travel around to travel to various places to see and travel. This is the wish I have already made." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This of course is not encouraging but just a little curious. The feelings of young people are usually not acceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since she is going to have her own reasons, what should I do to find her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, young people actually know how to make a choice." Cedros nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what to offer. Just an old man once told me that 'this world doesn't rotate around your feelings'. I think it makes sense. She has her choice." Asa's brains are mixed and stiff, but she listens to her own words that are as human-like as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha." Cedrus laughed. As if I am very satisfied with this answer. He nodded and said: "The talents who are not dependent on the children's personal feelings are qualified for major events." He pointed to the street like an artist who introduced his own singular works: "I will ask you first what do you think of this city?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Asa nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you know that two years ago it was just a barren land. And the army of the Einfast Empire is about to take this piece of highland. The orcs rushed to death. These races, which are similar to our human beings, will soon disappear from this big 6 forever. Know that their history is as old as our human beings, but the cultural forms are completely different. Their original way of life and ancient beliefs refused to communicate and refused to progress. As humans grew, they became weak and brutal groups. But look at the present." His look is no longer a display but a father. Showing your son. "Look at the scene of this life. Every orc is working hard to build this home. Have you seen such a vibrant city? Their original beliefs and lifestyles have been destroyed by the past tribes. Completely vanishing. The young people who survived the human slaughter are growing up in a positive self-effort and working with humans. They also have no hateful beliefs. They are no longer gods and ancestors but freedom. The legal system has also worked hard and struggled. Only two years after they built such a city, it will grow stronger in the future and may not necessarily become the most powerful country in the Big Six. Although I lead them, I am not here. Ruler. There is no need for a ruler here. In the early days of this creation, I will guide them to further improve the laws and institutions in the future so that the residents here can govern themselves. Such a country with a free and equal effort and a virtuous system of belief systems is The greatest country. It’s hard to start such a city from scratch. Is there anything more interesting and meaningful than this?” He waved his gray whiskers and wrinkles on his face without alleviating his energy and pride. "What kind of children, love, love, I love. What are the short-lived things compared to these big careers that have changed history to change the history of civilization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delos looked at the eyes of Assana’s youngsters with all their fighting spirit and hope. "I can see that you are a very capable person. How are you interested in helping me build such a country with General Gru? I believe that the joy I feel in pioneering and progress is unparalleled and you are still young." You can also take over to lead the country." The words spoken from his mouth can make every young person feel tidal. "At that time, the entire 6 exhibition will be changed by your hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it." Asa shook his head weakly. "I really don't have any interest in these big things. Now I just want to travel around freely and freely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I misread you." Cedros Staring at him and looking at it suddenly smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not independent of your children, how are you going to I don't know. You don't know how to face your feelings. You are afraid." The old man smiled a little. "You are too simple and kind. But the truth of those old guys is a bit too much. Hehe reason that even if it is correct, sometimes it is better to know less."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not speak. He is so annoyed in his brain that he is not interested in the meaning of this sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I advise you to return to the king." Cedrus took out a reel and handed it to Asa. "This is the delivery reel left to you by Bishop Ronis. You will wake up and go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wedding of the Duke of the Kings. Asa’s mind immediately had such an association. He shook his head and said, “I really don’t want to go to that place anymore. It’s not bad to start traveling like this.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you not with him?" Asa was surprised by this reminder. "Is he always helping you block the news that Oufu established?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros looked at him with a meaningful look. "In short, you are careful. I heard Xiao Xiao said that the story of the two of you in the swamp looks like you are probably the soldier who ran away from General Gru?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros said: "About two thousand people have been killed by us in two years. Only you are the only one who can escape from General Gru. People. Because this time to prevent the war, General Gru is very busy, but he told me to tell you that although it was a misunderstanding last time, it is really a very interesting battle and hope to have the opportunity to fight with you again."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled bitterly: "But I don't feel interesting at all and I don't want to have that chance anymore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedrus patted Asa’s shoulder and said, "Okay, go back. I have to go too busy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Said that it will not go back," Asa murmured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never go back. He wants to make up his mind but there is no strength in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, a blue light flashed in the magic circle of the Imperial King’s School of Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue and white magical light around his body faded away from Asa. It was only in a blink of an eye that he came to the magical school of the Magic Academy from the wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s finally back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the magical school Asa looked at the streets of Wangdu, which had been missing for a long time. He has been feeling like this for a while. It seems that the body is empty and part of it is uncomfortable and it seems that something is blocked. Although I decided to travel early, I didn’t know where I should go. Walking alone in the wilderness for a few days, after a lonely noon in the bushes woke up, I suddenly found out that the transport reel was opened and used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am back." Asa walked back to Sandro's big house and pushed the door of the big house. Here is his home in Wangdu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru’s old man is still messing up his body as if he would only do this kind of thing forever. When I saw that Asa came back, I was so shocked and looked at him and said, "How do you feel powerless this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked closer Shandrun’s unbearable face shook his head and said, “Because I think that I have to work here, I have no spirit.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart is still uncomfortable Maybe living here for a while will be better. Asa misses the kind of plain life that used to be here with Sandru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Sandro was a little surprised. "Now that such reputable young people are rare. In fact, I almost forgot about it. I heard that you were killed in the west for stealing the book. Is it good that I have already taken it back? The work you owe before you have such professional ethics and credibility is saved. You are now free to do what you want to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;doing what? What do I want to do? Asa stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the return of the work clothes to me." Sandro waved his hand and glanced at him. "It’s a bit dangerous to wear this stuff now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa took off his robes and handed it to him. Sandru put the legendary top defense equipment on the table and put a few hands and feet on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the store of Wangdu Street, Asa’s life spent the first time to buy a dress. He doesn't know how to choose, and he doesn't have to say anything. He only needs to pick up a sparkling gold coin. Naturally, the boss man ran to give him a deal. After putting on his clothes, he combed his head and scraped his face at the boss's strong request. I was a little surprised when I saw it in front of the mirror. I didn’t know that I was like this. It doesn't seem to be worse than the young knights of the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa suddenly remembered the appointment of the bishop and the duke. Cedros also gave him the idea that they should be returned to them and slowly unknowingly I went to the Duke's house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been waiting for you, I must thank you for saving the little girl the clutches of the kidnappers." The Duke led Asa into the ducal palace. Although it is still so bright, but he is secretly confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My daughter came back before her wedding, which made him feel at ease. Although the daughter did not mention what happened outside, but the Duke still estimated from the phrase that the young man had arrived in the city of Oufu, it is very likely that he has already been aware that he has been blocked for the city of Oufu. Message. What if this thing goes out? It’s hard to lie to him now. Just kill him and kill him? The consequences of not being able to anger the bishop are even more unimaginable. Where should I start? This is another opponent that does not enter the oil and salt. Power is not interested. Money is also not attractive to him. He used to misunderstand that this young man is fascinated by his little daughter but it seems obvious. As for the big daughter who chased him and came back to look at the look, it seems to have something to do, but she will soon have to marry a chip. Of course, she can’t go down in two places<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;And the thoughts and troubles of the Duke’s heart like a horse-drawn lamp are compared to the Asa. He walked with the Duke in the ducal palace. It is still so luxurious and beautiful everywhere. You can also see the people walking around and busy with the arrangement of the lanterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Father and sister's wedding dress is ready to go and see." Cris came from the front and saw Asa look a little surprised. His eyes have always looked on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also come to see if the little girl can rely on you today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Hearing the invitation of the Duke of Mulak, Asa’s heart suddenly had a strange feeling. It is a feeling that I finally found it. He now finally understands why he is so bad that he will come back to the Duke's House without knowing it. It is all to see her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; followed the Duke through a long corridor. He feels that he has never been so hard and so thrilling. Every step down, you can hear your heartbeat and keep squeezing the blood on the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After turning around a door, she appeared in front of her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is no longer the dirty adventurer's costume, but a white wedding dress, like the mythical fairy black and thick head is also very good at the site. It’s no longer a casual move. The thin face of the rouge was slightly decorated with some eyebrows. She has never been so beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. Asa felt that her empty chest was filled in an instant. It turned out that the place that was empty was her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw Asa. First, it showed incredible surprises, and then a flush of redness rushed to the cheeks to make the rouge above dwarf. Although she wants to work hard to restrain, there is a flash in her eyes. Her body trembled a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that it’s not just full of compensation for the emptiness of the long-term share, but the waves are pouring over the river. Countless huge impulses collide with each other and immediately rupture from the chest. Looking at the flash in her eyes, his heart hurts. The pain is like a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as one of her calls for a footstep, an action, a look, he can immediately rush to the chest and the roar will immediately explode. Regardless of whether it is the Duke's House or even the Imperial Palace, it is a thousand troops and a horse. He has to pull the knife and take her to kill. What is the life of each and what kind of world is going to *** eggs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, however, she finally restrained the flash of the blink of an eye. All the signs of excitement gradually returned to calm. He also smiled a little like a regular guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa can hear his broken voice of the internal organs being crushed by the tsunami in his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke’s slender eyes swayed on the two, and he naturally saw all of them with his subtle insight into the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My daughter is really the most beautiful bride in the world." The Duke’s heart thought that no one could see that he was a daughter before the marriage. The model of the father's image embraced her daughter lovingly and kissed her face. "You are slowly preparing. I still have business to deal with Mr. Asa."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s soul walked into the room with the Duke in the same way as the corpse. The duke personally closed the doors and windows. Asa is now the Duke’s bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bedroom is the place to sleep. A person usually only relaxes completely when he sleeps, so the bedroom is the home of the family. A true sense of the nest is a place that truly belongs to you. This most private place is definitely not used to receive guests at will. And if there is only two possibilities for reception, one is that nowhere else is available and the Dukes will never find a place to talk. The second is to talk to people must be the most private and secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke looked at Asa and said, "Oh, the next day, I will get married. I am married to the knight of the Marquis, the son of a Marquis of the Elni family. "The strange thing is that there is no signature gentle smile on his face instead of a cold indifference." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s expressionless voice does not bring any emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But Xiaoxi doesn't like him and hates him. He doesn't like Xiaoyan. But they still have to marry. Do you know why?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." Asa almost replied in a reactive way that he was still unsettled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of power. After I married the Elni family, I was very good for both parties' powers, especially me. My status and real power in the court will be more Take this as an opportunity to skyrocket. You have been to the city where Orford has seen the orc. You know why I risked such a big danger and promised to help them find a way to block the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Asa is swearing and somewhat frightened by the confession of the Duke, he is shaking his head: "I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is still because of power. After the establishment of the city, the city of Europe will have a great influence on the interior of the empire. I will marry the Elni family again. The political storms that arise from this will skyrocket. Even under one person and above 10,000 people. "The dukes of the Duke of Mulak reveal the eagle-like light. This is probably something that no one has ever seen." "But you know why I am so obsessed with power. Is it so eager?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." Asa was a little shocked and he felt the Duke's words. Unusual in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke looked at Asa’s eyes with a voice that was completely different from his usual gentle tone: "Because I used to be like you." Watching a woman I like is taken away by someone else. And that person may not even be a little finger of mine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At that time I was more than you Young and you are as free and free, and you are alone in the sky. You like a woman and she likes me very much. I thought that with a sword in my hand, I can protect the woman around me. Worried, but unfortunately the world is not a world of only two people. In order to keep her family's status and interests, she had to be a nobleman's chamber and finally was implicated in the war and died. From then on. Only then did I know that in this society composed of countless people, the power of the individual is negligible. Only power is the power in this society. So I have been trying to climb higher than anyone else and higher than anyone." Br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa was surprised to see the person who had been so deep and so flustered that his current leaks and enthusiasm were farther than the craziest pagans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s expression is filled with real emotions and living vitality. It is something that can’t be imitated by a brilliant acting. A stupid person who speaks benzene once can say his true emotions and excitement. Even if he can't convince people in the truth, he can be emotionally appealed to the listener. Moreover, the Duke is by no means a fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can see that Xiaoxi likes you very much. She is my daughter. I know her. I can see that you like her very much. I look at you. It’s my former shadow. But this marriage is absolutely impossible to change. It affects the political struggle and may involve the lives of thousands of people. At this point, there is no room for personal feelings.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the Duke locked Asa’s eyes, sadness, pity, and majesty to save all in his expression as a martyr. "Do you feel very painful? Very sad? I feel that I can't do anything about it? Do you want me to tell you how to overcome this kind of pain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stares blankly The duke listened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
