			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not look at the two Templars quietly listening to the noise outside the window and the corridor. It seems better to take a breather than to rush out. He gently touched the wrist of his hand and was immediately shrouded in a green glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wristband was picked up from the wreckage of a group of adventurers while he was in the Sandefes. He was only judging this from the magical fluctuations above. The extraordinary value, but until after asking Cedros, he knew that this is a top-level magic item. The magical array of fine magic items, including magic jade, is arranged on the wristband to store the two magics that are instantly applied when needed. Although it is generally impossible to store aggressive magical aids or healing magic for reasons that are difficult to control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Asa has never used this thing because he has never been used to using these magic items because he really does not know what magic to instill. Throughout Oufu, only he and Cedros would use magic and the two were not deep in healing and assisting. So this time in the forest of Tula, he would have asked Elder Lloyd to store two natural magic. Recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this decision is really wise. Natural magic is more effective in restoring ** trauma than white magic. These two magics are used by Elder Lloyd to hold the leaves of the world tree. The endless magical power has spread from the wristband to the whole body in an instant. The broken bone of the chest slowly healed the arm that was almost broken by his own punch. Although it could not fully recover, the pain of the heart was greatly relieved. At least no longer hinder the movement of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa still did not move. These two old Templars will not be his opponents, but it does not mean that he can easily break out from the ring of the two. This kind of veteran who has been playing for a lifetime on the battlefield is almost even fighting. But the gap between experience and judgment is definitely the most difficult opponent. He does not panic, the magic thorns in the room are still growing. According to the position of the three people standing and the growth of thorns, almost two or three seconds of the two templars will be touched by these thorns. Whether the two are concessions or swordsmanship is his chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is at this time. The thorns that had almost filled the entire room swallowed quickly and almost disappeared as soon as they appeared. Then the exposed door was exposed. I don’t know when the door was full and the pastor had joined more than a dozen pastors. The purifying technique used to dispel these magical thorns lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noise outside the window is getting bigger and bigger. It is already audible to see the neat pace of the battle and the thunder and lightning. The experience and judgment of these two old Templars are indeed very old and the quality of these church guards is indeed so extraordinary that they are set out of the window so quickly. The space between this room and the corridor is too small. The guards gathered here are the masters who are gathered outside the window. Although the skills are not first-class, they only know the number of people without listening to the sound. If you dare to jump directly down. That is no different from directly hitting the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis is at the door of the priest's front steel sword is already in hand. The radiant armor of the body was wrapped in the white light of Tianzhiyou. The pair of original phoenix eyes looked at Asa, and the distortion of the muscles on the face of the bloodshot made her look a bit embarrassed. Undoubtedly she has blamed everything on this for Asa. It’s not just that he’s all eyes, and he’s so eager to bite the meat of Asa’s body with his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the eyes are not afraid of people who have such eyes but can still maintain at least the calm and coordination of the action without any impulse. A reasonable way to narrow the encirclement by step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is undoubtedly the arrangement of the two old Templars and the direct expression of their faces without even the slightest expression on the face of Essar’s body. All the spirits of the last glance have been concentrated on Asa. Because they all understand what kind of opponent they are facing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa secretly smiled. Some regret that I did not bring a mask. It’s just that his face, which everyone has long been familiar with, can’t be cooked anymore. Everyone who sees it is shocked and afraid, and therefore he is always wary of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa watched more than a dozen pastors only felt a headache. Even if only half of them will use the attacking spells such as the Light of the Lights, or if they have a numbness, they will need to sing a half-day prayer to make a half-day gesture to use one to make the two old holy The warrior seized himself without any suspense. And the self-contained necromantic magic, no matter how it is used, the purification and demolition of these early-preserved priests will immediately pour over the ice water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention Talis. Asa had to admit that even if she was injured and empty-handed, she would have to work hard to get rid of the body of Eszal, not far away, but he would not dare to go around. Will give him this opportunity and idle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastors sang and began to continually assisted the white magic light to illuminate the two Templars and Talis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa knows that he can't wait any longer. If you let these pastors finish the prepared magic, then it is definitely a seamless match. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must move now. But how do you move? Where do you move? Will these people around him make him move? But if he doesn't move until the other party moves, he will be late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a thunderstorm at the same time. Everyone present felt that his diaphragm was twitching. The skin is shaking and even the heart is shaken by this sound. But it wasn't the thunder, but the snoring of Asa, which started with the thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you forced me. Go to hell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White vindictive and The magical fluctuations of black rushed from the body around Asa's body like a raging wave, and filled every inch of space in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis are two priests outside the Templar. Everyone's eyes are shrinking. Whether it's the temperament of this gaze or the magical fluctuations that can actually spill out of the body, it is the realm that only one of the top warriors or the great magician can reach. And now this young man who seems to be only in his early twenties can actually make such a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just the momentum is more important. Everyone naked in the field and unconsciously started the goose bumps. This is murderous and beast-like murderous violent to kill and kill to kill and kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that everyone who has seen this person has been shocked. The adults of Escher have been in a situation where they should be mad, and they are not panicked. Some are because their spiritual cultivation and combat literacy are the most important, but their spirit has already been taken by this person in front of them. This is the biggest 6 most wanted man who has assassinated the Bishop of Ronis and the Duke of Mulak. The most vicious assassin of the most vicious assassin in the dark demonic legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when they see this incomparable momentum and momentum, the mind instantly tightens to the limit as if a volcano is about to burst into a hurricane Tsunami. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone is careful that this guy is desperate." Talis shouted and the sacred guardian shield was opened. When a knight knight is facing the enemy, he has not yet started to open the last resort that should be a life-saving. This is absolutely unprecedented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two templars have a slight squat and a cross sword. The humming sounds continue to be the priests' various protective magic moments that have been lit up on each person's body and two or three pastors working together to prepare a broken magic. From these pastors, at this time, they did not panic and still behave. It can be seen that the combat experience and psychological literacy are extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa raised his fist and sighed with radiance. Everyone's eyes are gathered on this fist. He suddenly boxed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fist did not hit anyone but hit the ground or floor under his feet. A dull sound slammed the floor under the foot of Asa. His people have also fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floor is the strongest. The good Nanmu is specially treated and built. In addition to the weight, the hardness is strong and the rock is no different. But this punch goes down like these floors. The cracker broke like a cracker and it just shattered the small piece of Asa's foot and there was no crack in the other place. The rest of the room didn't even feel the vibration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis and the priests outside the door have stunned them for a while and still can’t understand how this supposedly earth-shattering counterattack would be such a result until the next In an instant they just woke up and what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two Templars were the first to react. They just stayed for a short while and almost rushed to the cracked hole at the same time. But at the time they just rushed, the dark green fireball burst into the hole. The thick corpse smell instantly filled the nose of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
