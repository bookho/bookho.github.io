			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the constant explanation of the mountain, Talis and Asa’s face is getting more and more ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rodhardt..." Talis said hard. Although the face was full of signs of stitching everywhere, she still recognized that this was the friend of Asa who had discussed the middle of the night in the previous two days, the captain of the Paladin who had sold them in the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man who said that he was laughing and laughing, young and handsome, and that the queen of a country is now a monster, is still being transformed into a living Such a monster. That period of ups and downs of feelings and life, the night before she had been seen from the perspective of the onlookers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Asa, this is a companion, friend who accompanied him through that extraordinary life experience. I personally witnessed his turn-over, saw his innocence and kindness, and experienced the infinite beauty he once stood on the ring, and his very friendly and nice smile...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this colorful life is now translated into the terminology of the Necromancer who describes the internal organs and organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How? Do you know these two people?" At this time, Shante paid attention to the reaction of Talis and Asa. "Oh, probably not a human now. According to the name of Lord Akibad, these two should be called fear knights, or dead knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Asa did not answer, did not speak, he was afraid that he would spit out when he opened his mouth. Ai Meimei began to vomit when she listened to Shante's commentary. When she heard Talis’s identity as a monster, she snorted and vomited. After an extremely shocking buffer and explanation, Asa also took control of two undead creatures from Shant. The control method is not difficult to learn, even simpler than controlling zombies and cockroaches. Both of these Necromancers maintain a good instinct. As long as the mind is moving, they will perform it themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no choice. The rest of the road is definitely not good. According to Shante. Although these two Necromancers are not completely completed, but the combat power has been much stronger than before, it is very helpful for this trip to the bottom of the earth. So even if you are disgusted again. He still had to accept these two 'gifts'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transformation is irreversible. Asa is clear that this method is more than a hundred times more difficult than the kind of transformation he did for the Queen. And Shante not only changed the body, but also controlled the consciousness of the two spirits with the magic of the dead spirit. Now these two people have no thinking ability, only the required combat skills and instinct are left, and the difference between death and death is not great. Maybe this is not a bad thing. Anyway, even if he is alive, there may be no good results, either for himself or for others. It is never possible to satisfy the people who are the most dangerous to anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the crocodile has been eaten for a while, and the two Necromancers consciously stopped the action of eating, and then stood upright It is not moving, like two sculptures. They are digesting food into the magical power of the dead in the body. As long as the meat is their food, Shant said that rotten human flesh is the most suitable for the transformation of the stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illuminating plants around the river are lush. Asa closed her eyes and prepared to sleep. The destination is not far away, take a break as well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the one that closed his eyes, Rhodes Hart’s face, which was stitched together by repeated craniotomy, appeared in front of him, and the pair Godless eyes. After completing this, is it to let him continue to survive like this, or simply let him really die completely? Asa is hesitating. Death is sometimes a relief, especially for situations like Rhodes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you die, you don’t know anything, no ambitions and no desires. Of course, there is no trouble, no more, no more unnecessary twists and turns, yeah, dead, forget it... It seems to be the sequelae left by the hilt of the black star, gradually falling asleep, thinking about this problem. Samuel returned to the boundless sense of death. It’s all dark and it’s all dead. The feeling spread from the deepest part of the body, slowly drowning all other feelings, he only felt that he was sinking down... to die, to rot, not to wake up again. Rhode Hart<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile, once a cool and beautiful, scenery. Talking and laughing, the blame that appeared after betrayed him... all flashed in front of his eyes, and finally it was the stitched Muran’s face, the muscles that had been practiced with the Necromancer, and the magical array. Bone, worth anatomy to learn about the liver and stomach... All of this is twisted together like a huge siege hammer violently hitting the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
