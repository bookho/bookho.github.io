			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s true that you should go to the School of Magic to see Bishop Ronis. Asa felt very embarrassed in the snowy and expensive carriage of the bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard Sedros said that half of the reasons for taking down the leaves of the world tree to save himself, but also because of Bishop Ronis. Moreover, the bishop also left a transfer reel for himself to come back to see him, but after returning to the king, he was all in the duke house and Xiaoyan, and actually saved this honorable and respectable. The old man hangs on the side and ignores it. He almost forgot a clean and went out for a trip. Fortunately, the bishop also sent a carriage to ask himself. Asa felt that she was embarrassed to face the majestic smile of the bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage has been driving to the entrance to the Cathedral of the School of Magic. Asa got off the bus and saw that the bishop was slowly coming out with the help of two senior pastors. He was also very respectful to follow an official-looking middle-aged man and a seemingly familiar young man. The young man shook his scorpion and saw Asa immediately showing a fierce expression. However, Asa did not care much about this hostile expression from the intuition that the tiger would not mind a locust on his own teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa blushes and walks over and bows to Bishop Rooney and says, "I am sorry for the bishop. I am late."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his opinion, this is a very thoughtful ritual that fully expresses his apologies and respect. But the faces of the other two people changed immediately, especially the look of the fat man who seemed to be full of fat. Asa’s dress is not a clergyman in the church, but seeing the bishop’s adults is not a slap in the face, but it is like being an ordinary elder. This is already very amazing, and even more incredible is that the bishop is also happy to show no dissatisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the prime minister. I have something to do now. It's better to come back next time." Bishop Ronis nodded to the middle-aged official. The easy-going and rigorous manners are not allowed to resist. The prime minister had to retire with the young man behind him and gave a deep sigh of relief to the bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa is probably a little rude to be himself. In any case, his identity will never be more noble than the prime minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really tiring to deal with these officials." Bishop Ronis shook his head and sighed. The two pastors next to them indicated that they had to retreat. "You come with me." He took Asa into the hut inside the cathedral. It seems that I don't want to let other people know the conversation between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Rooney signaled Asa to close the door and he sat down and signaled that Asa also sat down and smiled. It was so easygoing and graceful and said: "I I don't like the red tape. When someone else is present, it's not necessary for us to cope with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably only the less confident people will care. Others who are attitudes toward themselves and who are like the bishops are all convinced that they are tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I thought you should come yesterday." Bishop Ronis looked at Asa and smiled. "Is it going to the Dukes' House?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa blushed and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of my reason, the Duke probably did not dare to clear the person you know too many things. Presumably he wants to get in touch with you? But you can see He doesn't seem to have done it. He can be regarded as the most powerful means of the king. The number of people who can make him helpless is not much. You didn't let me down." Bishop Ronis looked at the two fires in Asa's eyes. The flash of light flashed as if it was easy to ask: "Did he not use the feelings of you and Miss Mulke to inspire you to win over you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not Understood and remembered the exuding rhetoric of yesterday, the Duke’s excitement was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Ronis will never send someone to follow him. And yesterday, his dialogue with the Duke did not know that he would not say that the Duke would naturally not carry his own feelings to promote. So how did the bishop adults know? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Ronis still said: "The Duke should be able to see the relationship between the two of you. His observations in these areas have always been good. Being good at using emotions is also a place where he is much stronger than other power machines. I can imagine that his rhetoric must be very exciting and very touching yesterday. But you don’t seem to be able to tell me that it is Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His answer provoked the satisfaction of Bishop Ronis. He reached out and patted Asa's shoulder tone and actually had a trace of excitement. "Okay. I don't think you can have such a heart when you are young. It's hard to know that the power of power is not the only thing. Only the relationship is the most difficult. Only a firm self-consciousness sticks to the talents who go their own way. It’s a real powerhouse. Only such a person can make a real big thing. You really didn’t let me down.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa hears a little mindless and seems to be a bishop The adults have great hopes for him. He doesn't understand what this ‘disappointment’ means. I just feel a little uneasy. He doesn't want to take on other people's feelings. It is even more cumbersome to hope that the bishop is such a respectable person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is a little more surprised. He saw something on the other side of the bishop's adult who seemed to be completely unclear in the eyes of the duke and others. So the deep and wise Duke seems to be in front of him like a child, but he only knows what he is playing by inference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""There was too much to be born during this time. It was just for you to retrieve the book. I know that you are so bad that you have arrived at Oufu. I have given birth to many things. All of this is too clever and too unexpected." Bishop Ronis smiled and looked up at the roof. This study is not big but the roof is surprisingly high. His eyes fell in the high space and revealed a blurred look. "Maybe it is the arrangement of fate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is even more inexplicable. He felt that these things did happen to be unexpected. But to put it bluntly, it was just that Ou Fusheng had a small misunderstanding to steal things without stealing them but was killed and then rescued. This kind of thing takes turns every day across the country and does not seem to use the ethereal metaphor of ‘destination of fate’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Rooney looked down at Asa. His two brows in his brows were suddenly flashing and suddenly asked: "I asked you a question privately. Do you believe in fate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Destiny?" Asa has heard of this thing. The beginning and end of the legendary stories often come to such a line that people can judge the end from the beginning of the story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Roone nodded. "The right thing is that all the world that has been arranged is actually moving forward according to its established trajectory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not believe." Asa’s answer is simply incomparable. The story can be so well-organized. It can be said that he is destined to be in reality, but he never believes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it really has it?" The bishop asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stunned and replied simply: "I don't believe it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Why?” Bishop Ronis. "If you know that you are only in vain, will you still do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing is futile and not futile. When a person is born, it is destined to die." Should you sit and wait to die? If you have time to think about the inexplicable problems, you should not concentrate on doing your own thing. And who can really tell what is going to happen?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Rooney laughed at the moment and thought about it. This cheerful laughter does not seem to match his thin face. Some of the thin face can't hold up such a violent expression. The smile has to break through his face and fly out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa was surprised to be surprised. I can't think of a few words that make the bishops so happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good" Bishop adults continue to repeat the word face is full of smile and vitality. "You are right. Who is really clear about what will happen? It is better to waste time on these issues than to concentrate on doing what should be done. I did not expect that I have always despised others to think too much on these boring things. Now I think too much. I thank you for reminding me that I really want to thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is it" Asa feels less I am so happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troubles of Bishop Rooney have been lifted, and it seems that they have made up their minds and said that they are so eloquent and said, "Well, this is the case. I am letting you come because I want to ask you." Help one. Can you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is such a dear and respectable old man who has just been so happy because of his own words The identity of the benefactor's benefactor is still very gentle, please help yourself to help a little busy. Such a request, no matter who could not refuse, Asa immediately nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Asa thought he had got it wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of Ronis sighed and said: "You don't know the current situation is very difficult. The other candidates are not the military or the Elni family. Yesterday There have been several military ministers coming to me and you have just seen it. The prime minister is also staring at this position. Now the political struggle is fierce and both sides want to win this war to strengthen their momentum. In their eyes, that is A political chip can actually be a war, after all, the lives of thousands of people may be because their fame and fortune disputes are inexplicably sent away. Tomorrow I will tell the emperor that he will retreat from the war. I rarely Speaking in these big things in the country, but as long as I say it will rarely work. And with Cedros also having his way, this armistice should not be a problem. But now the order of the emperor’s command has not yet been released for discussion. It will take some time for the troops in the west to still be there to fight. It is possible that there will be a touch. So I need someone who does not belong to any faction who does not want to establish military merit and is trustworthy to help me go first. Side ease the situation as much as possible not to let the war raw "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;". I really do this kind of thing does not come ah "Asa waved shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you must do it." Bishop Ronis looked at him with a very trusting look. "You must help me this busy. It is also saving the lives of thousands of soldiers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lives of thousands of people. Asa felt that she suddenly felt mad. If you forget it, you will be rewarded with the help of the bishop. He nodded. "Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Ronis was satisfied and nodded with relief. Today, his skinny and majestic old man is particularly happy and his face is particularly rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duchy's study. The Duke is dealing with a batch of official documents sent by the military. Recently, the troops in the west have all happened. All the magicians have not yet started the battle, and they have been completely annihilated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This accident on the front line is too late. This is a catalyst for the political storm that is about to begin. He must prepare for it. He is now half-hearted and half-hearted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Western military’s defeat was long anticipated. When Cedros asked him for assistance, he saw all the variables behind it in advance. As long as Oufucheng is a military minister who is eager for military power, this is a rare opportunity and they will definitely fight. But General Sanders will never be defeated by the opponents of Cedros and Gru. At this time, the Elni family will naturally seize the handle and want to use their own people to sit on the position of this general, but the military naturally does not Will agree easily. At this time, her daughter's marriage has made him a member of this family, and his subtle status as a military minister immediately produces miraculous effects. So all the plans that have been brewing for a long time will soon enter a good end, so even if he is as ruthless as he is, he can't help but be happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are still some unexpected factors that make him jealous. The trick is that there is an important object that he does not have in hand. Although this person does not mean to add to the mixed water of this beach politics, but if he holds the things in his hands, he can always turn his own into the eighteen layers of hell and never turn over. Even if it is only one in ten thousand, it is too dangerous. However, the existence of this danger is not dare to be eliminated by a forced direct method. This person is the most difficult object to be dealt with by the Duke. The power of the power is completely inconsistent with the fact that the oil and salt are not linked to each other, but it is still difficult to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke is now almost always thinking about how to deal with this person as long as he solves all his things is perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s deputy, the Cavaliers, sorted the documents he sent. Although he will be married tomorrow, his face will continue to see that there are still fluctuations in his face and still put his own mind on these official matters. In fact, after all, this marriage is just a ‘public business’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A priest dressed up in a hurry into the study. This is a 'sentry post' placed by the Duke at the School of Magic. Everyone in the capital and the ministers of the kingdom have such a person arranged by the Duke. As soon as there is any abnormality, the Duke can immediately get the fastest response in the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke knows that intelligence is always the most important on the battlefield. The officialdom is also a battlefield and a more esoteric and even more technical and even artistic battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentry brought a very valuable message. The Prime Minister went to the School of Magic this morning to ask the Bishop to ask the Bishop to appoint his son as the official of the battlefield. But the bishop later negotiated with several great priests to appoint another person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that it is not the very strange name of the sons of the ministers of the DPRK." The secret agent frowned. "It seems to be called Asa." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next to Clavis frowned. In his unique memory, there was only the title of power and power. However, this name is an exception. The name of the lower class, which he hates most, can also make him forget. This reality makes him always annoyed. I heard the name again now. The key is that the name has been linked to the power of power and has to occupy a place in his noble memory space. He felt as disgusting as having to eat a donkey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Duke listened to the name and immediately yelled at the table and said, "Okay." Not only did the mouth scream, even the expression on his face seemed to be Fight into a 'good' word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke waved his hand and let the spy return to his job. He saw that Klauvis’s puzzled eyes smiled and said, “Do you know the story of slow-cooking frogs?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I don’t know.” Clavis Never know what story he waited for the Duke to explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When a frog was suddenly thrown into a hot boiling water pot, it immediately jumped out. But then it fell into a pot of cold water. The water is cold, but the fire below is slowly burning. The water is slowly warming up and the frog is cooked unconsciously in the pot." The Duke showed his old smile. "As long as you are willing to go down the pot, is it still not easy?" He waved his hand like a chef. "I am going to prepare one of the most exquisite and most expensive stickers, and I will use the gold foil to engrave the words. Then let people send the incoming priest to the past. Be sure to invite him to the wedding tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of excessive intoxication in the smug mood, the Duke did not notice the unhappiness on the face of Clovis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, almost the entire Wangdu people are waiting for the wedding that has been held for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The groom is the disciple of the leader of the El Niño family, the leader of the First Knights of the Paladin. The bride’s career as the Duke of Mulch, the Duke of Military Affairs, is also like a day. This is really a good marriage for the family. The military and the Elni family, both of whom are in the midst of the tide, are happy about this marriage and are thinking about the benefits of the people on their own side being integrated into the other forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the civilians who are waiting to see the excitement, the grandeur of this wedding has never been disappointing. Dozens of ceremonial knights escorted a white carriage to the magical doorway. The wide red carpet stretched from here to the entrance of the cathedral, surrounded by small children with flower baskets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the newcomer walked out of the carriage, everyone couldn’t help but get a sigh of praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The groom is tall and handsome, and the golden lining of the knight is like the legendary sun prince with charm and brilliance. The veil on the bride's white wedding dress can't conceal her eyebrows and the black and silky black hair. The elegant and temperament of her hand-to-handedness is the viewer's temperament. Nothing to be drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the pair of monks walked on the red carpet and walked to the sacred hall, hundreds of young children were ready to grab the basket. The sonata of the solemn wedding of the petals thrown into the sky also began to sound from the hands of the royal band. For a time, the music is full of music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the center of this joyful celebration, the people around the couple can feel a sense of inconsistency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis struggled to keep a little smile on his mouth, although he could not find a reason for a smile. This is part of the job is an essential program and then stick to the hour and he can free himself and tell him. Through the dress, I can feel that the other hand holding his arm is so soft, but Klauvis would rather have the wood hanging from his hand instead of the fact that he never looked at him from the bottom of his heart. Woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small I only feel that I am holding a piece of wood. Looking at the petals that fluttered for her, listening to the music and cheering for her, it was a dead silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastors stood neatly on both sides of the cathedral and blessed the couple to stand on the platform and smile to wait for the grand wedding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no bishop. Probably with him to discuss their big things. Xiao Yan recalled the conversation with the bishop of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have not promised that your teacher, Cedros, will come back to perform the marriage contract?" The bishop was smiling and did not blame, but Xiao Yan was blushing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know. For young people, feelings are indeed the best, nothing can't give up. You are not wrong but you can't do it. You know if you What is the result of the escape? The military power that your father is about to get may not be expected. Whether the military or the Elni family get military power, the next battle will be a battle between the Empire and the European Union. Even the last. We can reconcile but there will be tens of thousands of soldiers killed in the Empire and Oufu from this to hate this is not good for anyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small bite His lips whispered and replied: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And even if you think about it, you shouldn’t look for him." Bishop Ronis was very gentle. Very merciful but there is no room for any change. "There are a lot of important responsibilities that are going to be on his shoulders. There is also a very ambitious future waiting for him. If you are going with him now, he is going to fly with him. This great good material may be so ruined in the children's personal feelings. I tell you ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the words of Bishop Ronis, Otaru was silent for a long time and finally bowed his head and said: "I understand. I can't delay him." She looked up and finally looked at it. A look at the west side of the looming big house turned and walked toward the ducal palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Rooney looked at Xiaoying’s back in the darkness and sighed and turned and originally wanted to continue walking towards the big house but thought about it and turned back the magic. College. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to marry the man around you and promise to live forever?" The voice of the great priest pulled the thought of Xiao Xiao back to the cathedral. The ugly face of the man tried to make her expression of divine love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is he busy with now? It is for the great future and is working hard to prepare. Xiao Yan replied gently and replied: "I am willing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With his voice falling around, the guests cheered. She turned her head and looked at the hundreds of people in the church full of the words she had just cheered. She only felt a cold and lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is now alone in the big house looking at the surrounding bodies. The post that the Duke of Mulak gave him was smashed and thrown into the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop has a great degree of education in the Magic Academy for a long time. The three great priests consistently believe that his outstanding ability to perform outstandingly is very suitable for the position of a priest. And he has been diligently and diligently guiding the deceased in the warehouse where the corpse is placed in the School of Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru spoke a mouthful when he heard this comment. But now I don't know where the old man went to go to Asa to find someone to talk to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and the person who missed him not far away felt almost at the same time as lonely and lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time in the other bedroom of the School of Magic, Dr. Rooney is playing with him in the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s hard to have such an opportunity in the future. I will be very busy. You know that there is too much behind-the-scenes work to support a hero. The bishop of the bishop listened to the faint noise and music of the outside and took a sip of tea. "But fortunately, I have a good start."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really going to want the kid to do something big?" Sandro, who had never said anything, suddenly wrinkled Said the eyebrows. "Don't you think that it is too difficult for the people to be too strong? That kid is obviously not the material for this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will slowly train him." Bishop Ronnies Smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not the problem. Don't you think that his personality is simply not suitable for doing something big?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I know so I didn't tell him the truth of the matter and let him slowly get used to starting from small things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru sighed Slowly saying in a breath: "The nature is hard to move. Let a bird that has soared in the sky become a lion. Don't you think this thing is too awkward? The kid will be very unaccustomed and probably will never get used to it."
