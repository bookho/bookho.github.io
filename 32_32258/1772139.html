			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun sets the golden glory of the plateau evening in the city below. Asa finally returned to Oufu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked at the buildings and vertical and horizontal streets below. The city has expanded more than a dozen times more than when it first came here, and it has almost the same size as the king of the empire. The fire and smoke from the street of the workshop can be heard in the air, and the noise is full of vigor and vitality everywhere. The city’s fringes and streets are still ubiquitous in the construction of new buildings. The city is like a huge creature that is slowly squirming. Change growth at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streets that are staggered are the blood vessels in which the blood vessels are constantly running around. The heart is undoubtedly the new city hall in the middle of the city. The huge and conspicuous volume is known from the air. People and orcs who come in and out from all directions bring life and vitality out to every corner of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although most of the buildings in Oufu are still rough houses built by boulder, but occasionally they have begun to have a more sophisticated workmanship. This is the case with this new city hall. The huge volume is comparable to any other building in the Big 6. It is still built of stone, but the details are no longer so rough. Concise and clear lines on the flat outer wall are occasionally simple but magnificent and bold, with a huge volume and rough materials to create a momentum that matches the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three monumental gallows and gallows engraved with the law in front of the City Hall still stand with a unique temperament and illustrate the uniqueness of the city together with the City Hall. Style and majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa knows that he has to stay here for at least a year. From a certain point of view, this will be his temporary country premises. Whether it is the Calendo Basin or the Imperial King, he prefers this rugged and vibrant city. There is no repression and no political conspiracy. Although returning to here is fulfilling one's promise is a task, but it has a feeling of easy relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wyverns hovered over the city hall for a few weeks and called three times to make sure that the following people would report the situation to the city owner and then fly out of the city. It is. Asa is still a big six-headed wanted man and naturally can't sway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the edge of the Oufu edge, the two-legged dragon fluttered with wings on the flattened peak. In a short while, two fast horses galloped from Oufu and went straight to here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the big head of Bolugan just came out from the edge of the mountain, he looked at Asa and shouted: "Okay. It seems our risk The investment is really not wasted and you are finally back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled at him: "Because I never like to owe someone else's feelings. And apart from I can't think of any place to go here for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh. Isn’t it because you didn’t run because General Gru’s escort?” The skill reached the top of the mountain with a sensitive touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Absolutely not." Asa smiled a bit. If he really does not sneak away from Gru, he is most happy, maybe the three do not know how to track his necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay. Haha." Bolugan said with his fingers. "From the beginning of the year, your brain worth 5,000 gold coins is worth about 13 gold coins, 69 silver coins, and 86 pipe copper. Every hour, about 57 silver coins, even sleeping and sleeping. It is definitely the most expensive mercenary in the Big 6. Please remember that you must help us with the quality that is commensurate with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa smiled and he liked the unobstructed character of this dwarf. He smiled and asked: "You won't catch me on the last day and then sell a five thousand gold coins?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured." Gru Lightly opened. "The guy named Roland will never pay this account. Because he also knows that you can't afford this price. Even if someone actually takes you to reward him and your prime minister, you will definitely think." The way to help you run away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Sedros came up the mountain. He is still a brisk pace, and his waist is so straightforward that he is not weaker than the young man. The golden sunset dyed his whiskers red and yellow as if it were more spiritual. He looked at Asa and Gru and laughed too: "You are finally back. I think you will be able to bring me some good news. How about the Einfast Empire?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old." Cedrus smiled and shook his head. Although it was said, the look on his face remained undiminished. "If you were really stopped by me at the time, I really want to regret selling drugs for the first time in my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled and said: You have your considerations. Cautiousness is not wrong. It is the judgment that you make after considering all the factors. And I insist that it is just a matter of arbitrariness."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A good disregard of the willfulness." Bolugan seems to want to pat Arthur’s shoulders. He only had enough hands to get his vest and he patted it. "I was just willing to help you with this wayward boy, so I tried to persuade the city owner and General Gru to help him. In fact, I also know that this plan is very risky in terms of the balance of interests and rationality."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros smiled and said: "Knowing that the adventure has made such a suggestion that you are a staff member of my assistant but dereliction of duty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; Bolugan adults nodded. Fortunately, his neck was thick enough to support the swing of the big head above. He said: "But fortunately, the fruit of this dereliction of duty is good. The dynasty died after the empire did not fall into turmoil. Your lover also got the position of the prime minister. Everything is ideal." He looked at Asa and smiled. "But except for your crimes and black pots."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter anyway, I don't care much about this." Asa sighed at the east where the empire was. The sky has already appeared in the sky. There are so many things that he gets rid of and abandoned under the sky. He nodded and said, "Yes. It's all over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right," said Gru. "We met three flies when we came back on the road..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flies?" Cedros. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled and said: "But it has been a little trouble and has already been rushed away by us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;When listening to Asa’s Gru’s account, Cedros’s relaxed face was completely dimmed and replaced by incomparable dignity and anxiety. He slowly shook his head and said, "No, it will never be a small trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out to be a big problem." Bolugan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean that the Necromancer will come to take revenge?" Asa nodded. "A group of top magicians seems to be really a big problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really hope they are just magicians." Sedros smiles. I continued to shake my head. "The next thing is not the word 'trouble'. It can be summarized. It is the problem and it is the biggest problem." He sighed to the south and said, "This question was originally going to face sooner or later. It’s time to start ahead.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just hope we can be faster than them." Gru faintly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros nodded and looked down at Oufu in the sunset below. The vitality of this golden city is so beautiful and so magnificent. The next question is whether it will continue to exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conference room of Deya Valley. The two necromancers told the acting president the battle. The skull mask has been taken to reveal the faces of both Adela and Master Eden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is already the sacred Deva Valley. Necromancer's absolute paradise and homeland, but Adelaide could not erase the feeling of fear when he recalled the situation of the day because of the story. The overwhelming power gap and the fear of facing death are the horror of being branded into the soul for him who is always confident and even proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis closed his eyes and thought about it and then sighed and said: "It’s too big. In fact, as long as they keep a distance of more than 100 meters from them. The two men screened one person and tried to use the big mantra, and they had absolutely no room for struggle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adela and Aydin masters nodded slightly. This is true. Even if that person is more powerful, it is an individual. If you use this tactic of completely swaying your own advantage from the beginning, maybe this battle is very easy. And maybe the things that were originally available are not so good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them seemed to blame him for anything in any case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before acting as the acting president, I did not investigate the other party's information before the three distinguished members went to action. It did not give you appropriate advice. My dereliction of duty.” The Marquis apologized to the two Necromancers for bending down and seemed to have done something very wrong. "I'm sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now the respected Nimbath is dead. This is a very big loss for the guild. Can use the eagle besides him. The only people in the eyes are Ved Nina and Mr. Shant. Ms. Ved Nina is impossible... and the teacher’s body is too bad. We can’t really give him the burden to make him a hawkeye. So I I decided to study the eagle eye surgery in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... seems to be not suitable for you." Adelah hesitated. The eagle eye is undoubtedly a very useful magic. But mastering this magic is extremely difficult. If it is not magical rumors and talents, it will have a bad influence on the magic level of the magician himself. Nimbath is the weakest one in the guild because of this magic. It seems that the talents in the guild do not need to be done by the acting president. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this is what I should do." But the young acting president has insisted on this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adela nodded and looked at the Marquis's eyes with more praise and admiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Aiden also nodded indifferently, but the light in his eyes was a little different from Adela. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If only one person in the guild holds the eagle eye, this person is undoubtedly the only eye of the guild. There are some things that he can let everyone see and make it invisible. Although there are some doubts and uncomfortable feelings in the heart, Master Aiden knows that there is no one in the trade union who is willing to take the initiative to study this spell and it is even more impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Aiden said coldly to the Marquis: "This man has killed two members of Asri and Nimbas. History is an unprecedented shame. I want to ask you what you plan to do in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis sighed and said: "Can threaten the lives of our noble members. The person is naturally going to kill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Three people still can't kill him, then go to four people." Adela took a deep breath and the original kind and beautiful face was already excited and burst into a sullen atmosphere like the Madonna. Light. He said slowly and word by word. "I must kill this guy myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" The Marquis looked at him and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because this is the enemy of the guild is the only one who can threaten us. Naturally, I can never let him go."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it's because you are afraid." The Marquis's voice is very warm and peaceful. Even those who are sensitive will not think that there is any irony. "You are a person who is far stronger than you. He not only destroys your self-confidence but also deeply feels the horror of death. So you use anger to cover up the fear and want to kill him with his own hands to overcome his fear." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adela did not speak. Because it was said that his eyes were a bit tempered but also a bit confusing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis went on to say: "Man and the beast have neither a strong physique nor a sharp minion, and even those who are fierce orcs will be afraid to tremble. But rule the world. It’s people. Are you strong or wild?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adela thought about it and probably understood the meaning of the Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one is not afraid. The real powerhouse is not a fearless ignorant but knows how to deal with its weaknesses. Our organization is big. 6 is the most powerful and powerful organization. Every member is the most elegant and noble. They are all standing at the top of the world. Why do we have to spend unnecessary effort and spirit to risk their lives and Only a beast is more savage than a minion than a minion? To know that our power is not manifested in the power of direct violence.” Marquis smiled and relaxed smiles were all faint and unrecognizable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
