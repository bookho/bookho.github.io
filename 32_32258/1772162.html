			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight infused the white magic into the crystal of the hand, a crystal that is so intensely incomparable, and the crystal of the crowd burst out silently. The basement is instantly filled with light that is emitted from the crystal, which is the essence of this light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scream of screaming more than killing the pig replaced the scream of his pig-like pig from the throat of the skinny man. When he rushed forward, his footsteps were very good. He just stood in front of the horsewoman. The light that no one dared to look at was almost a close-fitting photo in his basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small screams did not last. A weapon from the back of the volley passed through and ended his pain. His body was pushed forward by the knife and just fell on the crystal on the horsewoman's hand. All the light was blocked by his body and the smell of burnt smell was immediately ten times thicker. It seems that some people just burned a few pounds of stinky meat in this basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight rides the half-hearted body and stands up and throws away the crystal that has been broken, although there is still pain on his face. Broken bones can't be restored immediately, but with this buffering time, it is enough for her to be able to recover the state temporarily with her own white magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man took a step forward from the body of the skinny man. The dark red on the knife was darker and redder. The faint blood in the air was also heavier. It is. The face of the horsewoman was immediately more ugly. She noticed that the weapon on the charred black body that kicked her foot was an evil weapon full of blood and darkness. I was actually a momentary person. This was originally a good opportunity to collect opponents' weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syracica also stood up. Just now the man’s knife made the thin man make a shield in time and others closed his eyes in time. Only a few unlucky thieves suffered some minor burns. Now everyone's eyes on the Knights of the Temple are no longer scruples and fears. A woman who has been devastated by the most threatening auxiliary magic has been eliminated and even the last card is used in their eyes and the lamb is no different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika’s expression on his face seems to be the direct formation of two words. One is 狰狞 one is obscene. His whole body muscles are laughing and saying: "I will give you a chance to take off all the things on your body and then..." His voice and look suddenly stunned because he did not look from the face of the female knight. Despair or fearful look in anticipation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple now look very embarrassed. The bloody flesh has covered the light of the Glorious Battle Armor and there is also a lot of blood on his face. The original bright face also appeared to be a bit embarrassing not only because of the blood and because of the extreme anger and fighting spirit. She suddenly pulled out two things from the belt and it was two magic scrolls. The knight, with the injured hand, barely and quickly unfolded the revolving waves of magical waves, and even the skin could feel the sinful atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression on the face of Silika is stiff and he is now judged wrong. The equipment of this shrine knight is good. The legality is by no means the imagination of the grassroots. It is only obvious that the knight has never taken out these high-end goods because of lack of experience and too much arrogance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a reel that burns in the blazing flame. The breath of magic overflows just in the blink of an eye. This flame grows up and becomes a hugely composed of flames. Human form. The other reel was turned into a dust. The dust fell to the ground and swelled and deformed. In an instant, it also became a huge human figure in the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two figures are all over five meters high and the head is up to the basement ceiling. Even the huge body like Helicel looks like a child in front of such a monster. No need to fight. It’s just that this volume and appearance is enough to destroy the fighting spirit of ordinary people,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elemental summoning?" Everyone was shocked, especially behind Aisi and the old man. Two magicians. This is the top magic that every magician dreams of being able to display. They often have their own control of these elements in the dreams of decades. I can't see them at this time. But it is in the hands of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The onlookers have finally froze. I began to desperately squeeze towards the passage. Xi Lika's deterrence will not be the biggest of the two top magic, especially the burning of the fire element, no need to fight, just close, you can burn people to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Hilika did not take care of this time, and actually he was thinking about running away. The horsewoman shouted the prayer to herself and the two elemental giants with auxiliary white magic. Although this should not have the same horrible effect as the white magic attached to the Glorious Battle, it is enough to make people feel chilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aisisi was so scared that even standing still stood unsteadily and sat down on the ground. The thieves escaped more madly. The narrow passages passed by. So many people jumped to the tops and shoulders of others and stepped on the crowds like a lot of locusts. The screams and screams mixed into a basement that wasn’t too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government card is shaking all over the body. Although the masters next to them have not yet run, he understands that he has lost his painstakingly created Shamuhi thieves group may be destroyed. He used his strength to eat milk and restrained his screaming and rushed to the temple and his impulsive impulse to tell his reason that he must now consider how to escape.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "All *** give me a stop. Don't run." A roar like a thunder suddenly blasted and shocked everyone's eardrums. The original panic was instinctively shocked by this sound. The status of the card boss in these people's minds is deeply rooted. And this sound is really shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most shocking person is Helicia because the snoring is not that he is out of the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who is out of this is actually the man with the dark red knives. This guy has been speechless since the beginning and has no strength. There is nothing remarkable about it except that his appetite is very good. I don’t think that this time, it’s actually the more he’s coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is not just calling for Helicel, he is still helping Hip-Like. He stepped into a thief who was desperately trying to squeeze into the passage. Then a knife broke into the thief's body. The thief opened his mouth but could not make a scream. Instead, it was a strange snoring. The thief's body also quickly dried up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the Helicopter and others were jealous, even the horsewoman was confused by this person’s actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person has no mud and water. The knife spurted bloody and rushed straight into everyone's nose. The original dark red knife was already a bright red piece of blood condensed on the knife. This knife actually pumped out the blood of the thief. Then he broke into the thief's body in the other side of the emperor's thief. The thief also shrank like a deflated ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight is the first person to wake up in the first time. She waved to the two element giants and shouted: "Kill that person." Two elements The giant immediately took a big step toward the man. Isis, who was about to die at the foot of the fire element, immediately returned a life and moved to the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two elements of the giant's stride just two or three steps went to the man. The element of fire is that the whole body rushed to the man to smash the earth element and waved a man's body-sized arm to hit him. Under the huge body of two elements, this man seems to be very small and should become a group of coke or a local patties without any difficulty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the man has killed four thieves and the hands are no longer a knife but a large group of bright red blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell of blood is already heavy and makes people feel dizzy. The thieves in the vicinity of him can feel the bloody smell of the skin. In the bloody smell, this person seems to have become more violent. Facing two elemental giants who are more than twice as tall as him, he suddenly slammed his knife and screamed out: "Big death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of blood Replaced all the scenery. Only the best Helicika in the eyes can see. The blood on the knife became a bigger blood knife. The man's white vindictive light slashed the bloody knife down to the two element giants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood knife turned into a scattered blood. A loud bang sounded like a torn piece of paper. The giant of fire element was cut into two pieces from it. The smell of blood transpiration from the high temperature can almost kill the two pieces of the wreckage of the giant element of the fire. The earth element giant's arm was broken by the shoulders and fell to the ground and smashed the huge body and shook the next butt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation of flying down makes everyone feel that their heads are not turning around. The two elements of the giant originally surprised everyone to add to it, but in the blink of an eye these two monsters that scared everyone off were struck as suddenly as they appeared. If it is not full of blood in the basement and the deep trace of the basement can witness this incredible blow, they will feel that they are dreaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth element has no feeling and no thinking, no mouth, so it won’t scream and only stand up silently and awkwardly. The entire basement suddenly became very quiet, leaving only the man's long sigh of relief and a strange slight snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
