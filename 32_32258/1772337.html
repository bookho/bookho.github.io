			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ion Fass can give us limited support, I don't think if Celeste really goes to the power of the Western continent to attack us. At that time, they can also put all their national strength into the battle. And Tatliya’s national strength is too weak, and at most it can only be used for a certain amount of production.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .... Would you like to return to the elite troops of General Gru and the Sandefes Mountains? The base there should be built, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The other troops will not be used, let him come back alone." Sedros nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, one person will do." Sedros Eye There is a cold flash in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that he seems to be very comfortable, well, then forget it." Moriel nodded thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think... Gru is actually your adopted child..." Asa tried to put the red-haired woman in her mind. The image and the image of Gru are coincident, and it seems that they can find something in common. It is not the appearance, but the unique temperament that other people, or other human beings, will never have. Asa was astonished to be surprised that some of the originals were so relieved, and only this dragon could cultivate a man who was as strong as Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as in the forests of Tula, Jessica, who was kneeling at Gru, said the word "the messenger of Morial". However, Jessica did not say anything later, Asa did not ask, until this time, only learned from Moriel's own mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s strange to say that it was more than twenty or thirty years ago. I was suddenly awakened by strange magic fluctuations in a long squat. .... Actually the vibration of the most advanced space magic, then a baby appeared in front of me. I don't know which guy actually used an incomplete time-space transfer technique for a baby. Even in the previous era of elves That is also a taboo * surgery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is probably produced by the elves and humans. The noble elves are combined with the low-lying humans, in the elves. The empire is indeed a felony that cannot be forgiven. You know, in the infinite time and space, this coordinate is actually sunken by my side. This is a strange coincidence. What is this... fate No. What is the word?... Coincidence? No... It seems to be called "Yuan". I remember that it was a golden dragon that told me the word, the word has a very Interesting meaning. Well... maybe it’s the guy I’ve known before wants to entrust him to me, but I’m not The law knows who it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scattered gold coins and various treasures have been restored to a small Jinshan under two or three magics of Moriel. The dragon's blood altar that sealed her soul and vitality was buried underneath. And Moriel has reverted to the original appearance of the huge black dragon on this golden mountain. Although the state of the human form is more flexible, it seems that she is more relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is kneeling on the ground. Looking up at the giant beast above the Golden Mountain. According to the experience of the old guys like Asa and Sander. Moriel is both a self-explanatory and a self-talking memory. Although her illusion of human form does not seem to be old, it is difficult to have a standard to measure whether she is also "old", but she must have more experience than humans in life beyond humanity. Come chewing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He didn't talk to me and followed the old man of Sedros. I thought I wouldn't let him go out? That was his own destiny. I don't have the right to interfere, and I don't want to interfere. It's just that these years are occasionally boring..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa quietly listened to Moriel Then, this is the opening: "Well, now you know what you want to know. Can you tell me what I want to know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mollier's huge faucet I clicked on it and said, "Is it a question about the Dark Star? My agreement with Akibad is not to disclose these to the people who inherit his Necromancer, so I can tell you some."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed and touched the joints where he was still hurting, saying: "Before this, I want to know why Akibad The channel that was specially left behind is actually the way to death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why damn?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The meditation that he can stay with is completed, that is, it is possible for this person to pick up the dark star, such a person. Why don't you die? Not only does Akibad think he is damn. Even I think he is damn. This is a rare consensus. It can be something that is beyond our expectations. It is actually your weird little guy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Akibad...doesn't you always want to pull out the dark stars?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did he think of pulling up the damn sword? Although he is a very annoying guy, he is not crazy, he would not think of committing suicide and then destroying the world by the way."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is..." Asa only felt that the more he asked, the more dizzy he was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Asa’s expression, Moriel made a burst of laughter from the cave. "It's still telling you from the beginning. Kid. It seems that what you have always thought is far from the real facts. What I told you is enough to surprise you." She paused. Looking at Asa with a strange smile, "I will tell you an interesting detail first. Does the sword handle you think that you said the last acting president was interrupted? Don't dream, in the dark star. What condenses all the dead and dark atmosphere of this continent for thousands of years, it is the power of countless people, even Agibad has no guts to break it. The hilt is actually broken. It was only that Akibad had reluctantly placed it on it. No one has dared to pull it up in the past few hundred years. That is what I broke it. I went to the Shadow Mountain Range five hundred years ago to find this. The sword, want to destroy it, but was stopped by Akibad and his friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Why?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mollier looked with interest at Asa’s unspeakable face and slowly opened his mouth. "Tell you from the beginning. Kid. You are the only person on the continent who can know this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least in the history I know, there is no Anything that records the Dark Star is present. I don’t know how long ago, I don’t know whether it’s natural or what kind of race is done. The southernmost part of the continent is in the shape of a magical array, the atmosphere of the mountains and the whole continent. Connected, whether it is an elf, a human, or another intelligent race, the spirit and the slight magical power left behind after death are brought to the mountains by the veins, and these breaths are highly condensed at a point in the mountain. It became a sword."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In my time, the elves of the Elf Empire actually noticed the power implied by this thing. They also understand the dangers of this thing, and have deliberately developed a series of protection methods that do not allow people to touch the sword. But then the elves began to rush with our dragons and Titans for infinite expansion. After several wars, there was finally an Elven king who thought of using the amazing power of this thing to deal with us. That idiot, the thing that brought together the birth of countless dead thoughts, can be used by living creatures. The magical protection of the special wizard of the hundred elves does not have any effect. The elf king holding the sword becomes the undead monster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elves, people, even Lianlong and Titan can't resist the power of this sword. It is the power of the whole continent. Countless creatures are killed and become the controlled undead. Finally, all the remaining races are united and ready to be The Undead Elf King was wiped out. But when the army gathered near the Central Mountain Range, on the Elven City on the Central Mountain Range, the Undead Elf King launched a spell attached to the Dark Star."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before this, our dragons and feet, the wizards, all thought that their magic had reached its peak. But when this magic was released from this sword When we came, we only know how small and how ridiculous we are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are countless flames and meteors falling from the sky, and large earthquakes igniting lava eruptions. Central Mountains Originally the center of the mainland's veins, the death and darkness of the sword spread along the veins to every place. The castle drifting in the sky. The city on the ground, everything is ruined, the situation is like the end."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Blade of the Doomsday, this is the name of the sword at the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only our dragons are here The trauma of the catastrophe is minimal. Only I was seriously injured at the time, and the rest of the family only helped me with magic seals into the ground waiting for myself to recover slowly. More than five hundred years ago, when I regained consciousness, I found out that my people were gone. The Elf Empire, the Titans can no longer find traces. Instead, the once-inferior human being became the master of the ground. I have incarnation* to understand that you have only a thousand years of history in human history, and no one knows anything about the Blade of Doom and the Holocaust. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
