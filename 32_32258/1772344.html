			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru’s figure was not hindered by the slightest hindrance, and the yellow sand that had been scattered was like a human-shaped lightning that chased the Tima priest. The shape of the Tema Grand Priest was a meal, a tragic sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just after using magic to fly back and turn around, Tima High Priest felt two strange stings from the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tingling was first cold, then pain, and then began to numb, and a strange sense of weakness began to spread from the stinging area to the whole body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this sting, it is the surprise and anger in the heart that makes the Tema Grand priest out of control. He knew that the two feelings on his back were poisoned and cursed, and it was the poison and curse peculiar to the eagle's knives. The high priest in the rage returned to a boxing out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no time to pull out the two knives that pierced the back of the high priest. Basil Ray turned around with a fly-like sensibility in a very small angle in midair. The priest's fists rubbed against the good shoulders, and brought a flesh and blood. The bones broke and the eagle eagle chief gave a sharp and screaming scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Gru has arrived, this time he did not use his fists, but the fingers, the palms and the fingertips in the neck of the Tima high priest Cross over and then stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tima High Priest is still retreating, but the footsteps have been smashed, and the huge body has knocked down a shrub and it has stopped on a tree. The bright red blood sprang from his throat like a cheerful fountain, and his body was completely saturated with red in an instant. The voice of the earth can't tell whether it is from the mouth of his mouth or from the wound of the throat. I don't know if it is his own voice or the sound of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge bulls eye almost went out of the body. All inside is anger, unwilling, not convinced, watching Sedros, who he calls ‘my friend’. He suddenly took a breath. It can be seen that he exhausted all the strength left in the body to absorb this breath, and then his voice mixed in the throat of the throat: "I was called Sedros to take you out of Nigan. The price is three magic black crystals. This is the price you have in his mind..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru slightly, the face of Sedros is Slightly changed. The blood of the priest's high priest was sprayed with blood, and these words were rushed out of the blood that overflowed into the throat. The high priest finally showed a sly smile with a bloody bubble, and finally, his huge body crashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things didn’t need to be taught by me... The Thamma priest finally glanced at the basilale that fell to the ground, staring at the huge cows. The eyes are dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru came forward. Looking quietly at the corpse of the high priest on the ground, the black eyelids restored the original squat and the ancient well. Suddenly he turned and asked: "Who is letting you shoot?" Basile was originally holding his shoulder and was stopped by Gru, but the cold sweat on his head was still raining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am afraid that if Tima really ran, it would be difficult to do it." Sedros was speaking, and his face was calm. Nodded to Basil. "Good job, Ms. Basler Lei. You can rest assured that the eagle banshee will be a member of Oufu Zhenzhen. You should know what happened here today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, I certainly know. Several princes of the princes sneaked into here. In the battle, the Tema high priest was unfortunately killed, and we also killed a shrine knight." Basile nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sedros smiled and nodded. "Well, then you are bothering to tell this to your local people. When the Tauren arrive here, you have to bother you to appease them. I will try my best to let the Tauren accept your leadership. Now go and deal with the injury first. Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roulere came over and took out his two nine from the body of Tima's high priest, for this former ally who has become a dead body. She didn't even have a glance at the interest. Indeed, as the Tema Grand Sacrifice knows, she is not an answer. She knows that she is only a vassal in the eyes of the Tauren, but it is just a card. There was no choice at the time of Niegen, and it was because there was no such habit and thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is, as Tima’s high priest thinks, these things only need to be pinned out. It’s just that he didn’t think that the first person to call was the one sent by Sedros. And a single force needs to be supported by people. The mind and the mind are relatively not so deep, the eagle banshee chief, it is obviously better than the strong and strong ambition of the Tema high priest to control, much better manipulated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
