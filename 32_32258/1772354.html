			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the phoenix phoenix that is tens of meters wide, the body is divided into two full moons of fire clouds disappeared. The white light rain is also gone. Only the black sky still has the trace of the white light. Everything is cut and disappeared under this sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two bodies of the phoenix are still falling on the ground, but the flame is far from being as strong as the previous one. After the flame, the body of the phoenix became a pile of ashes. The surrounding fire elements are still gathering in the pile of ashes but this time the concentration has been very slow. The sword that is open to the earth contains not only the influence of power but also the level of space and elemental ions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bang of the giant sword was heavily inserted in the pile of phoenix-burned ashes as a majestic monument. A few pieces of crystal fragments spattered in response to a slightly inaudible crack. The fluctuation of the elements of the fire in the air, like a sigh of a giant's sudden death, finally agitated and finally completely subsided to return to the most primitive silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire Glorious Castle is boiling. Everyone has seen this ancient hand-beast, known as the Undead, finally falling under the sword of the Archangel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still no expression on the face of the golden angel's golden eyes. It seems that the countless worships and cheers at this foot are completely unrelated to him. He looks down at Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa can't see it but can feel the majesty and pressure like a mountain tilting to the top of his head. He knows that the angel has already paid attention. Got to him. In his hand, he suddenly slammed his knives and screamed: "Get out of the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From letting the phoenix throw the angel away, he wants to take the opportunity to escape outside. Did not escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot has changed to the Phoenix. The swordsman and the priest have been attracted by the sky-shattering battle that was originally an excellent opportunity. As long as he is allowed to highlight this circle, no one can hold him around again. This only takes two or three seconds. But just as he just left for a rush, he stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is actually Talis in the cell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred warriors have already removed the cell from the skeleton. The aftermath of fighting between the archangel and the phoenix completely shook the ruins. Talis had been standing by and watching quietly, whether it was Asa, Lancelot or the prayers and battles of the pastor's magicians. She stood there and watched, but the expressions were always weird. When she saw Asa rushing out, she suddenly grabbed a templar's sword and rushed to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are crazy? Don't block." Asa smashed the past, although he also told Talis that he would stop at this most critical time. Surprised but he knew it was not a surprise time. No matter who is in front, it can only be opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis is barely holding this sword, retreating her and biting her teeth, it seems like she used a lot of effort to shout out: "Stop this person, he wants Escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the templars around this block have reacted. Although their minds were attracted by the war in the sky, dozens of trained fighters immediately came up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think of Talis!" Ai Meimei’s face is incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis did not answer. I didn't even look at her. Just raised the sword and madly rushed toward Asa. The light rain in the air has disappeared. The white magic in the air is diffused. The two Necromancers have gradually recovered their mobility. The templars that have been surrounded by them have been tightly sealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Asa Big Brother, leave me alone, let's go...you don't fight." Ai Mei yelled in Asa's arms but was again Do not dare to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s face is slashed to Talis’s knife. A knife is more difficult than a knife to resist Talis. But no matter how hard she did, she did not step back and evade Asa, but she was actually blocked by her. Although the templars next to them continued to help, but they were mostly slashed and retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Talis did not step back more than half of the offensive. She was taken by herself. She seemed to have no scruples at all. She was not afraid that the knife that was filled with strange smell would be cut on her body. Every attempt was very fierce. Both play and lose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a situation, Asa’s swordsmanship, which seems to have been too clever and doesn’t seem too powerful, is completely out of his previous impressions. . That is the crystallization of talent and Lancelot's long years of teaching. Although the strength is that Asa has the upper hand, she can't push her away two or three times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the feeling of the fire in the air has completely calmed down, the incomparable pressure from the archangels is like a mountain, and Asa has put down Ayi. Mei roared out with a full force. He knows that this is the last chance. If it is no longer, it will never be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strike is truly a full-scale black knife light like a steep black frenzy overwhelmingly completely obscured the sword light of Lisi. The few templars who were involved in this knife around him could see that such a knife could not be blocked by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, there are countless companions and the goddess Lancelot over there and the miraculous angels, even if you let a hide, this person should Still can't escape. So it seems that no stupid person is willing to use his own life to take risks and block such a block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s just that there is someone who doesn’t hide or give up. There is a long sword back in Lisi. With the sword on the arm, the two hands intersected and the magical light gathered all over the arm. She actually used her body to block the knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white magic of the sky has been dissipated as if it was dispelled by this knife. This piece of overwhelming black is not just a knife, but more of a deadly magical corpse. Helium. And enough to kill all the souls and kill them. In this way, the force that kills the air and the suffocating qi is all the same. Only a master who has integrated the mind and martial arts souls like Lanslot can use it. This is also a knife that other people can't resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis can't see the power of this blow even if she doesn't use such a blow, but she still condenses all strength and vindictiveness. Come to block this knife. Because as long as she does not let Asa this knife will only have a sturdy figure and then a weak momentum will leave the best opportunity for others, he will never escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black knife is in full swing. In such a frenzy, it is more fragile than the bread soaked in water. In the eyes of Talis, there is no fear or even strong emotions such as fighting spirit. There is only a strange calm and sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister..." Ayimei’s screams have been completely submerged in the wind and momentum of this knife. Even if she doesn't know the martial arts, she can feel that Talis is only blocking the knife and letting Asa smash it into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘When’’’’’’’’’’’’ All the swordsmen here are veterans who have experienced many battles. They can all hear it. This sound is the sound of a mixture of metal and bone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis was not smashed into pieces and just flew out like a cannon thrown by a trebuchet. The bang slammed straight into the wall behind the wall and collapsed. Tali buried it underneath but the blood that she spurted out in the air was visible to everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not just the vomiting of blood. It’s not just Talis, but also the blood of the mouth. But it seems that I am also hurt and temporarily unable to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if he can’t move, there are others who can move. Rodhart and Hilika, surrounded by the Templars, suddenly rushed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white light rain summoned by the archangel has dissipated white magic and gradually weakened in the air. Although the movements of the two Necromancers are slowly recovering, it seems The recovery is very limited, so the Templars can work together to trap them. But just after Asa’s knives, the two Necromancers uttered a strange scream of black juice spilling from their facial features. Then their movements were completely restored to the time they just rushed into the Glorious Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two figures who had just struggled in the white magic of the Templars suddenly added a few templars surrounded by them and were directly hit and flew up. Then they rushed to Asa and Ayi Mei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
