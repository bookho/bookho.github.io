			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really don't know what the hell's secret room you are. You can find it yourself. Asa is also hysterically shouting. Just a huge psychological pain. He has already pushed him to the limit. He feels that he seems to be only one step away from madness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Javy has no reaction to his angry screams, just static The last finger of the right hand of the Black Elf was quietly held. He advised a friend to drink a cup of tea and said: "You think about it again." Don't worry that she can still hold it. Even if you don't have any confidence in your memory, please be confident in my white magic. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just outside this time, an urgent footstep came from then and then shouted: "The bishop is going to report to you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there something important? Bishop Jia Wei quickly got up. He had been strict and did not allow anyone else to get close to it. And now that someone has come to inform it, it is really a very urgent matter. He turned and Lot. Hart went out to the dungeon together.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the dungeon was sullenly closed and it became a silence, leaving only the breath of Asa and the Black Elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can the beasts do this..." Asa squirmed on the ground with a rotten snake that was pulled out of the spine. He felt it for the first time in his life. Such pain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has experienced many battles and has been severely injured. Broken bones are broken and the bones are broken and opened. Even the internal organs are broken. Cracked... These feelings have been experienced by him but until now he knows. The most painful is not the pain of ** but this mental torture.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cardinal has just hit every word he said on his heart. The most painful The words are undoubtedly implemented because it represents an irrefutable reality.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repent humiliating and angry hostility...when you understand all the reasons are actually because of your own time Emotions will double back and continually bite and squeeze in the heart. So people habitually like to find excuses for their own mistakes to find their own hostile and humiliating objects. This is not just escape or subconscious protection Emotional means.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But reality is ultimately inescapable. And escaping never gives any power only when people go straight to the pain that cannot escape And the reality of accepting this torment will get the more realistic courage.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This courage is the power that a person truly has. The power in pain.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa slowly straightened up and sat down halfway, his gums leached with blood under his own efforts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The School of Magic Academy is surrounded by several of the Bishops of Javi The priest led to come here and watched a big hole in the wall. Rodhart was also on the side.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that there is something to tell you to let me see this. hole? Bishop Jia Wei looked at the rotten wall and his face was similar to the wall. The pastor next to him immediately bowed his head and said: "The bishop is like this." Just a few of us are suddenly seeing this wall broken. A large figure flew out from the inside and disappeared over the trees and walls. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you come to me for this kind of thing?" Let Ryan’s great priest not look at it? "Although this sounds really a strange thing, but the mind of the Cardinal is not here, he is a little impatient.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These pastors are also a bit stunned by them. It is a young man. Bishop Jia Wei has shown extraordinary skill and his own temperament during this time. The temperament momentum has already erected the image and prestige in the Magic Academy and the Wangdu, especially these young pastor magicians. It is regarded as an idol. Therefore, although several large priests and priests in the upper middle school of the Magic Academy still do not let go of the power to him, but in the eyes of many people below, he was also the successor of Bishop Ronis. So after this incident The first time I came to find him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Things are like this..." A young pastor explained quickly. "We just started to see this strange thing." I thought that who was doing what the magic test failed, we went in from this hole and looked at it after a while... The specimen of the eagle in the library disappeared. At this time, we only remembered that it was the specimen of the big eagle that flew out of the wall and it seemed to be sitting on the individual..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest continued to lower his voice and said, "I participated in the battle of the Necromancer of the King of the Kings a year ago. I thought of it when the specimen of the eagle was flying out... The slight magical fluctuations seemed to be... Necromancer The taste...so we rushed to inform the bishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Bishop Jia Wei became very dignified and serious after listening to this report. He walked from the hole to the library and looked around and then stared at the hole that the specimen had broken. Suddenly his body turned his head and nodded to the pastors. "You have done very well. Very good, don't you mention anyone about this?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, before the priests nodded and excited, the figure of the Cardinal had already rushed out like a gust of wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have an urgent matter to do. You should first go and see the two people to make sure that there will be no mistakes and then return to the Paladin headquarters to assemble the staff. Just in case." Jia Wei said to Rhodes Hart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt nodded silently and turned to walk in the direction of the dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in the dungeon’s door did not seem to change. Rodhart went up to see the black elf on the ground. Then I looked at Asa in the prison and sighed softly. From the time he was with Jia Wei, his face was always calm and cold like ice. Until this time, his face finally came up with a whisper of a whisper: "I'm sorry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said it very lightly and is watching On the ground instead of talking to Asa. He leaned down and put his hand on the ground and snorted the mantra on the body of the dying black elf. After the flash of white magic flashed, Jessica gasped for a long time and the muscles on her face were not so distorted. Rodhart reopened the prison and threw her in with Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is still sitting on the wall half-sitting for a short while this time he seems to be exhausted after tens of thousands of miles in the wild and sinister. The original refined look has long since disappeared. The eyes of the eyes in the eyelids are now full of bloodless gods but they are deliberately watching Rhodehart not saying anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt no longer said anything. He just quietly checked the prison and then turned and prepared to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing is so sorry." Asa suddenly said in the middle of the prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well?" Rhodes had a slight glimpse. Turned his head and looked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said nothing is sorry. You are just doing your business. It is my own fault to send it to you. You are a know-how. Knowing the interests and the rational choice of people. It is my own fault. I have your heart to think that you are as childish as I am. So there is nothing to be sorry. You can not only have more words with him. Big power is a better chance and he seems to be better than me to handle the matter of Chris." Asa said faintly. His voice is now very calm. A pair of bloodshot eyes, though there is no god, but there is something else in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Rhodeh nodded and nodded to his friend who had just betrayed to show his indescribable look on his face. With the depth of his city and the heart of the present, these feelings still cannot be completely concealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No thanks." Asa also nodded to the friend who stabbed himself in the back. He is completely calm down. "I finally understood and admitted that the guy said that it was all right. Everything is my own fault... but I am a little strange that you are not confident about your teacher? You really think Roland Will you be able to take you for a long time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not confident that Teacher Roland is more confident in Descartes. More confidence in Bishop Javey... ..." Rhode Hart replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that he does have confidence in you. I am relieved to let you know that everything is safe to let you stay here and look at us. "The calmer the look of Asa's eyes, the more deep things in the eyes are beginning to become more and more obvious." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are wrong. He is not confident in me. He is confident in the interests. The trust that is maintained by the interests is always stronger and more stable than the emotional maintenance... ..." After returning these words, Rhodeh turned back to the door of the dungeon. When he got to the door, he suddenly stopped and didn't look back. He just whispered: "Sometimes I also remember that when I believed in feelings and justice, it was really naive and ridiculous... but... sometimes Some..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the iron gate closed again, Asa also regained his gaze. He still looks like a donkey and a wolverine, but the things in his eyes that have never been seen before start to light up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame is also lava. But it was not the kind of flame that released the heat and the light. The flame condensed like ice because the power and the light all projected into one's heart. This is the power of the heart that comes from the real pain and temper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does that stinky old man really have nothing to do with it?" Asa sighed and closed her eyes to earn the last trace of the exposure. I was lying still in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a battle away from the king’s three hundred miles away is almost coming to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge hands of the steel magician merged and finally caught the body of the swordsman in the middle. The sound of the hyperthyroidism and the internal organs of the bones is like a person who has crushed a hundred eggs at the same time and squirted blood from the completely distorted body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the crushing ground is only between the waist and the belly of this swordsman. The swordsman’s head and chest and his arms are still there. Although he is definitely not alive. But after all, he did not die immediately. He also used all the residual power in the remaining body to cut a sword and slashed it on the chest of the magical couple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical runes on the body of the sword in the sword smash also shattered a lot of the action of the magic couple obviously sluggish. This magical rune that maintains the magical movement is engraved in the body of the magical even with heavy hammers and heavy weapons. It can be seen that the destructive power of this sword is great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician released his hand and it was not like the swordsman who fell to the ground. This warrior, who is definitely a good hand, has no slightest screams. It seems that the meaning of his existence is just to cut such a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scar on the body of the magical couple has been quite a lot compared to the core that is destroyed in the body. This way to slowly destroy is the only way to deal with these steel monsters. As long as the body structure is damaged enough, these magical couples will also fall apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground suddenly popped up with a huge, sharp soil column that hit the metal magician's body. A muffled sound like a bell. Under such a heavy blow, this huge metal monster finally stayed still and then trembled and fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is already the last metal magical couple. Other places have already fallen down to become a pile of scrap iron. Not only that, but also many ruins of stone ghosts scattered around. These are the fronts of these swordsmen. But relative. Just fell down is also the last swordsman. The last magician in the team used the remaining magic power to make a land-based spell complete the scene of both defeats. At the same time, the magician’s body slowly swelled into two black blood and slowly collapsed into a ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midair, the Necromancer took back his own eyes and sighed softly. Here is the height of hundreds of meters away from the ground. At this distance, killing a person with the impact of a dark soul and the opponent is still a low-level opponent, even with his ability is slightly more difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These guys are so powerful..." Another fat one. The magician who also had a silver skeleton mask was crying. Because the metal magicians below are all his gargoyles, and almost all of the things he made are worth at least half a city, even if they are not worthless. And there are two metal magic couples who are just one face and become scrap iron under Roland's sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These people who are close to protecting the emperor are all of the Paladins who only want to take your two scraps of iron and iron and want to take it without damage. Others are really unlikely." Master Eden, who floated in midair, said lightly. Only he did not sit on the gargoyle in comparison to his six unreachable air magic. The flexibility and degree of the flying ghost like the gargoyle is similar to that of a pig. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master Aiden, if you can do more, maybe I won't lose so much." Necromancer continued to cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Aiden still said coldly: "I said that I am only responsible for the containment of Roland. Now I have at least done it. Nopolino Do you think that the pile of broken my life is worth it? Want me to fly to the vicinity to fight him?" The long silver beard on his chin is only funny. There was some bruise on a small lip. This is the consequence of his acceptance at the beginning of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the head of Roland was only a sword. No one knows how the sword went to the face of Master Eden after 50 meters. And the sudden speed of that sword is too late to prevent it. It is the fastest and most flexible 隼 can not escape. Fortunately, Master Aiden’s flight was really a little bit faster than the eagle’s cockroach. After that, he was no longer close to Roland's 100 meters and only harassed with magic at that absolutely safe distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No need to argue anyway, our purpose seems to have been reached. Although the combat power of this guy has indeed passed our imagination, but we finally won." Another Necromancer looked coldly and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there are only two people standing below them. One is the emperor of Ian Fast. One is the head of Roland, the Paladin. The ground of the two people is full of gargoyles. The magical bombardment of the potholes guarded the broken limbs and wreckage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Shura hellish venue, Roland is still standing straight and still cold. The sword in his hand is still so tight that there is no battle on his body. Causes a scar on the ground or a mess like an immortal war god. But in fact, he himself knows that he is almost at the limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter who is facing the three top magicians in the sky, the unstoppable magic bombardment can last for so long. Also pull out from time to time to help others deal with the magical and gargoyles. At this point, it will be exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Geffenhardt XVII behind him has long been a face, but he can continue to stand. But Roland knew in his heart that this was not the protection of himself and his men, but the three magicians did not target the emperor at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geffenhardt XVII’s hand has no bond power. If the goal of these three Necromancers is really he is afraid that the Paladins are here. There is nothing to do. The wizard who uses the Dark and Soul Magic spell is the perfect man to kill this weak goal. But he has never shot the emperor. Instead, slowly and slowly kill other swordsmen from a distance. The other two Necromancers, one of them who controlled the magical spear, circulated over their own air with the air magic that was far more flexible than the birds. There were three times for myself and his men to use the transfer scroll for the emperor. The necromancer immediately dropped the serial lightning and the thunderous bombs in the rain. The other two also used all means to attack the two times before they hardly sent the magic. The termination is terminated. The last time the priest in the team burned his life using the sacred asylum to protect the emperor from using the transfer reel to leave but the Necromancers used a very rare 'space lock' reel to completely enclose all the space magic in this area. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rare and rare for the necromancers to use this reel as a last resort. And almost all of these three necromancers are carefully kept at an absolutely safe height. Slowly use the magical couple and the single attack magic to kill his fighting power and his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolande can see what the goals of these three Necromancers are. Their goal is actually themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer who used the magic of the air to get rid of the gods did not use the top air magic. The stars were flying away. Another Necromancer did not use the soul and the darkness. The scope of the fusion of the big magic 'Lob of Soul' is not something they can't use. Rather, they are not willing to use this wide range of killing magic. Roland is not very effective, but Geffhardt XVII is likely to suffer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t want to hurt the emperor but they must stop the emperor from using the transport reel to escape because the emperor was a baggage that could not be abandoned for Roland. As long as the emperor still stays here, whether he wants to escape or desperately fight back, he will have a scruples. So they can safely kill Roland to death at an absolutely safe distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the strength of the three Necromancers is already far above Roland, but to ensure that they can be harmless, Roland is absolutely unable to escape. There is only one such method. Although the time will drag on for a long time, the means seems a little mean but it is absolutely effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s almost time to end everyone’s shots. I can see that this guy’s vindictiveness and physical strength are almost exhausted.” Master Eden took the lead. At the same time, a trick of thunder and a violent bomb flew toward Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Thunderball’s approaching Roland, I feel that my hand seems awkward. This kind of magic has just been smashed and smashed many times, in addition to the fireball ice thorn blade and so on. His feelings have begun to become somewhat numb in the hands of the sword has become much heavier than usual. I don't know if he can still open this time? This time, then what will be the next thing that will be like a storm? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Aiden’s figure in midair was abrupt. Suddenly he seemed to feel what was lifted up and then his body shook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although with a sly mask on the face, the eyes on the lower half of the enamel master’s face are still showing a horrifying look. . It's like seeing the most incredible scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbelievable (continued)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central image of the teaching has been removed to reveal a dark Real estate mouth. The rancidity and moisture from the real estate mouth made Ryan’s great official frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, it is undoubtedly very inappropriate to open this place that was originally hidden. If it is not the cardinal, it is very anxious to ask this time to go in and see. Seeing Ryan's great priest is definitely going to open here at this time. For this he had to call everyone out of the cathedral and let no one else come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this dungeon is the most secretive part of the School of Magic, there are still a few people who know it and will not hide it for the successor cardinal. But to say why this dungeon is built and the real role of this dungeon is probably no one knows now. If you only hold those dangerous monsters, you can build prisons elsewhere. It seems that you don’t need to be in the underground of the sacred cathedral...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Ryan’s priest is now I don't want to go into these things. He vaguely feels that maybe the cardinal knows what he is not. Although Bishop Jia Wei has not yet officially taken over the Magic School to take charge of the keys, he is not a good refusal to ask himself for rush. He can see that maybe the cardinal is really likely to take over the Magic Academy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a few days before the arrival of the king’s capital. Bishop Jawi first cured the Queen’s strange disease and then spread that Queen’s Majesty would fully support him. At the same time, the great man of Rhodes also walked with him very close to the bishop. Almost every day, he went to the prime minister and the prime minister. Although it is already a consensus that does not allow this outsider to come to the magic school, this trend has to be reconsidered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the new captain of the cardinal. Naturally, every place has to be reviewed. This dungeon was watched by the bishop of Javi in ​​the first two days. Ryan's great priest is very unbearable. The smell inside is like a rancid cotton. It is stuffed between the chest and abdomen of the man. Instead, the cardinal is interested in this place and carefully looks around. The case of the great priest about this prison. It’s a pity that Ryan’s great gods are really not interested in talking about it and the cardinal seems to have some scruples when he rushes out of the basement with a reluctant expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this time the Cardinal is eager to go on again. Ryan’s great priest feels a little strange but has not asked much. Although he still does not know whether the cardinal will not become his true head, he is clearly aware of this unclear situation. Don't go into the depths of these unclear things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a horrible silence in the dungeon. This is deep underground. Everything is isolated from the outside. There is nothing in it that can make a sound except the bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cages that hold the monsters have been opened, but all the prisoners have become dead bodies. Whether it is a bullhead like a ogres or a living monster of Medusa and evil eyes, it has become a fragmented wreck in a pool of blood. A few ghosts and zombies are quietly standing in the corner and not moving. Bishop Javi, who only looks at the prison center, is more obedient than the most obedient dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javier Biwei shakes the blood on the sword and the sword is eagerly looking around. He has once again used the dungeon to search the dungeon as quickly as possible. Even the prisoners holding the monsters have not let go, but he still has no clues that he needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If time permits him to be willing to knock down every inch of the ground and walls in the dungeon, carefully and carefully check in his hand. The huge and rigorous magical enchantment outside the dungeon is a bit too much for a place where only a monster is held, and Jarvis faintly feels that the power and precision of this enchantment is far greater and deeper than the surface feels. If the guy said it really is really no other hidden place. It really should be the most reasonable place for the teacher to collect that thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But leaving him to look up slowly is not much Jawi knows that the most important one of Sander’s bottom line is probably This is an important opportunity now. There is only one way left to find out that this is the single most effective way to use this rare opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the king is three hundred kilometers away from the south. Master Aiden looked at the flying figure and met the ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strictly speaking, it’s not that he met a ghost. As a Necromancer, whether it is a ghost or a zombie, what Aiden Master sees in his eyes is no different from watching a dog. So the present expression is not that he saw the ghost but the other common people saw the ghost. Unbelievable with fear and shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was just a thunderstorm that was just a little sparrow. It’s just that this sparrow is flying too fast. The eagle eye that Master's attach to himself has reached the top and will never see the true face of the black spot at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to smash a thunderous bomb can never be an ordinary sparrow. But it wasn't the sparrow that made Aiden's master show his expression, but the one who made the sparrow fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge raptor does not know when it has already flown over this piece of the sky. There is a huge wingspan of nearly ten meters. This is a Sandefis. The eagle is unique to the mountains. But no one cares how this rare raptor will fly here. Everyone's eyes and attention are concentrated on the person sitting on the top of the big eagle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the same expression emerged on the faces of Master Aiden and Nopodnot and another Necromancer. Unbelievable and terrifying. fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground. The head of Roland, who saw this scene, finally breathed a sigh of relief. Originally, it was only for the purpose of preventing the accident and the means of communication could not be truly useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong? Are they coming to the reinforcements again?" Geffenhardt XVII frightened and asked. Being able to stand up at this time without stumbling to the ground shows that the emperor's guts seem to be getting much bigger and slower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolande shook his head and sighed. At this time, he only had his sword in his hand. He didn’t hold it firmly. “Not our rescue.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man in the midair eagle wears just a common priest’s robe, the white head and the beard are tangled together and are swayed by the strong winds in the sky. shake. He has a mask on his face like the three Necromancers. The same is the shape of the skull. However, the three of Aiden’s masters are silver, but they are a kind of pale gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't think of it..." The man spoke. Although the wind in the sky is strong. But he didn't seem to forcefully speak the sound clearly to everyone's ears. "I really didn't think that one day the three Necromancers would come together just to kill a person and still use such boring and unappealing means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three masters of Aiden are like a clay sculpture, they can't move in the air, only the gargoyles and eagle owls flap the wings. Nopolino's half-lifted hand flashes the magic light. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A frost storm that has not yet been completed. However, he did not complete this in half and did not dissipate it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the eagle is not as great as the one sitting above the gargoyle, but once it appears, it completely shocks everyone. God takes it for granted. His sitting posture and oblique body can also be seen as an old man. At first glance, there is neither momentum nor any pressure, but unconsciously, the space around him seems to be dark. stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man on the eagle sighed and said: "And what I miss most is that the noble necromancers are now able to be like power and interests. Like a mad dog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person’s voice is not only small but also very calm. It seems to be just chatting with friends but on the head of the three masters. They all started to have cold sweat leaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person said that this hand is no longer the three Necromancers are silent. After a while. Nopolinot finally broke the dull silence first. He said with a voice: "The former former acting president, you seem to have vowed to not interfere with the guild in front of the dark star when you left the guild. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your memory is so good... I can't remember this vow, it's hard for you to help me remember..." The person nodded and answered. This answer made the other three Necromancer's faces change obviously but he slowly said: "But since you reminded me, I will naturally obey. As a Necromancer, even the once dead spirit The vow of the mage in front of the Dark Star is impossible to violate...
