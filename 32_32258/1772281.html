			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the sun well under the ancient tree of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war water tree has not yet continued to draw the well water wells of the sun well has now recovered to the lower half level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luya has let all the nearby elves go away. But this is not her own meaning, but Asa let her do this. She is now puzzled to see Asa take a small pocket from her arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A firefly is flying over the sky and the light that makes it clear that it’s just a cloth pocket and a very Rough cloth. But from the shape of the pocket that is now soft and swaying, it seems to be filled with water. If you look carefully, you can see that there are countless tiny magic runes on the rags that look like roadsides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa spread out the soft pocket of the hand and sighed and said: "I am here for the whispering of the singer for this thing. Inside the sun well The water is not enough, and it can be supported for a maximum of two or three weeks. It will be fun when it is time-consuming. So I have to come here to fill this pocket first."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun well water?" Luya looked at the shock and asked. "When did you take it here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not me. It seems that the old man who brought it out of the whistle valley is still five hundred years old. I am afraid that the goods will fail at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is inside?" Luya asked. She saw a small bump in her pocket that seemed to contain not only water but also something else soaked in the sun well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A very troublesome thing, you stand a little farther." Asa shook his head helplessly, indicating that Luya let go and then kneel by the sun well. . Untied the rope tied at the mouth of the bag. "The woman who has a problem with her mind is not in the middle of it. Otherwise, she can get entangled..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slang of the sacred warrior is not far from the forest The magical eyes are looking at the direction of the whispering forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tamek Knight is still standing next to him like a statue, and next to another Templar. Talis and Abin are standing behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin has not been caught or tied. On the contrary, he is now standing upright and his face seems to be full of precision and seriousness. Instead, Talis is full of anxiety and confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician just disappeared. Now the man is working with the Sun Tree of the World Tree... "The magical eye of the sacred warrior's head has condensed into a small group of pupils like a small group of celestial balls. To the limit.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well? It seems that something suddenly appeared..." The Templar's magical eyes squinted at the top of the head and then shrank the pupil in the middle and then rose up. The cockroaches that almost broke through the eye went straight into the air. "That is..." It seems that this sudden appearance is a bit strange. The Templar is not just running the magical eye to the limit. Even his own eyes can't help but squat and stretch his head. Look at the direction of the forest.<br />< Br /> /> </ br> </ br> The samurai fell to the floor with his hands and feet twitching. His expression and his face were as ugly as if he had wanted to eat a bite of food. He was suddenly poured into a ten-pound stool. It was not only because he could not stand the whole person. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one cares about what is going on in the end, almost at the moment of the templar’s ​​present thing, everyone’s eyes are on the whisper There has always been some absent-minded Talis I looked at the past as if I had been stabbed with a knife. It was almost out of the inherent instinct of a creature that they felt something horrible from there.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This is already the night. There is no starlight and moonlight in the sky. It is simply that the fingers are not in the direction of the whispering sensation. At that moment, people feel that they have seen it. Seeing a black.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the darkness of the night can't give this piece of black a covert and blur. This is the real black. There is no vitality and the light can be born in it. A group of dark nights seems to have been swallowed by the black. The surrounding insects of the insects immediately disappeared and the black silence is like the legendary dark hell.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
