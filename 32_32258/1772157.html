			<div id="content">Hey, 47 points, I will know how this difference is. It’s just that a group of rabble faces the professional players. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is just the movement of patting the ball, irrelevant to the national economy and the people's livelihood, I waited for the rise of the small people to see the score after the two sentences. But then there was some grievances in the old Jewish. The Chinese Basketball Association immediately came to the enemy, and it was sealed. It was out to explain the evasiveness and angered the old man’s nonsense. It seems that the English sentence is a state secret from the mouth. The nuclear war caused the 1.2 billion Chinese people to mourn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wonderful article by Mr. Bo Yang can make a wonderful comment on this matter, look at the official and see:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Patient: I am going to get married next month, and I have to make a big banquet. You have to enjoy the light and be my guest. What is the result of my disease test? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor: Sorry, I am afraid I will report you a bad news. The result of the test is here. I am afraid it is a stage III lung disease. The first one is cough...< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patient: It’s strange, you said that I cough, you just don’t cough, why is it not lung disease? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor: My cough is different from yours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patient: What is different? You have money, have knowledge, go to the university hall, drink the water of the Amazon River, and have a superior bloodline, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor: Can't say that, there is a fever in the middle of the night...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patient: Can't say that, How can you call your heart, like your intention? I have a fever in the middle of the night. I used the electric fan in my house. I can use my hands in the middle of the night to get a hot blisters. Is it a three-stage lung disease! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor (grievance explanation): Hematemesis is also one of the signs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patient: My family is a dentist next door. People who go to see the teeth are vomiting blood. Do they also have three lung diseases! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor: Of course not, but integrated...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patient: Ok, back Ten thousand steps said that it is a lung disease, but also a seven- or eight-stage lung disease. What is the relationship? It is worth your yelling! Are foreigners still suffering from lung disease? Why do you say me by pointing your nose? I am getting married next month, who doesn't know, can't you say something encouraging, why should you hit me? What is my complaint with you? What is your hatred? Are you going to break up us? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor: You misunderstood what I meant, I just said...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patient: I am a little bit I don't miss it. I saw your lungs at a glance. You lost your mother at a young age. There is no family warmth. In middle age, because of rape and murder, you have been in prison. The legal sanctions against fairness are full of hatred, so look. No one else is happy, and no country’s national glory can be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor: We should talk about things...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patient: I am just talking about things, tell me frankly When you first murdered, how did you get it, not to mention the old lady who was kind to you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor (a little panic): The diagnosis is based on the test of your blood and saliva. I am not talking out of thin air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patient: Of course you are not talking out of thin air, it is equal to your original knife, and will not be inserted into the old lady's chest. Your insult to the progressive patriots is enough. You are single-mindedly hating your compatriots and saying that they all have three stages of lung disease. Don't you feel shameful? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor: Brother, I just love you, I hope that you will recover soon, only to be vocal, and not malicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients (sneering and coughing): You are a bloody executioner, and conscientious patriots will unite to stop you from doing the "love" Murder of the motherland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor: I am based on laboratory reports, like saliva, which is the test of the University of Scorpio...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Patient: Chongyang Meiwai, Chongyang Meiwai, you are the undercurrent embryo and skeleton bone that loses national self-respect. I solemnly warn you that you have to pay the price of worshipping foreigners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
