			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great world, all beings. If you don't have enough strength to stand at the top of the world, or at least the top, it's small, humble, not worth mentioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what beautiful feelings, great dreams, the meaning of life, no matter how great the value, in the contrast of your existence than you are stronger than you It makes no sense. Just like the countless poultry that many insects eaten by birds every day are eaten by people, it is like a dust in this world, which can be ignored. Needless to say, no one will remember that you won't have a place in the life goals of people's memories. Even if you are still alive, you will be drowned by countless other people, waiting for the power that is stronger than you to swallow it silently, then The world continues to work. There is no difference between you and you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt can’t remember exactly where this belief came from, perhaps when it’s time for the emperor to follow the Duke of Mulak’s eyes. Maybe after the incident happened in his hometown, it may be earlier, perhaps an instinct that is born with it. He has been lurking in the depths of his soul since he was a child. He has to be a hero since childhood. The dream may also come from this instinct. As time goes on, more and more things are going on, and this belief is stronger until he integrates all the feelings and souls into one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friendship, love, he is not without feeling. In fact, he has struggled many times, and he has almost given up on this ideal several times. Occasionally, I think about it. At his age, the status and future he already has has long been dreamed of by countless people, but these thoughts just flashed past. After all, the power of that belief made him give up everything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the world is not going to be strong because of your desires, and how persistent your beliefs will change for your wishes. He failed. Although he was not reconciled and did not give up, even if he lost his love friendship and future, he put his life on the gamble to make the final struggle and efforts, when he finally met the Necromancer in the Shadow Mountain. He seems to have seen the door that has always been in his dreams and finally opened a gap for his efforts and his beliefs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But finally waiting for his results is actually a test material for others. Rubbish. Objects, dust, and even bugs are not as good. This is the fact that is in front of him. He wants to be crazy, but he can't go crazy, he wants to die, he doesn't know if he is still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Archangel’s dagger’s great sword divides his body into two, the white magic that rushes into the body not only dispels the deadly mana in the body. . The seals under the brain of the Zhongshan Special Branch were also washed clean. Shante did not have time to eliminate his memory and thinking and gave him to Asa, because the seal of this necromantic magic is complicated and subtle, except for Shant himself, no one can solve it, but the angel’s sword contains Magic is the glory of the entire Glorious Castle for centuries, and has already surpassed the scope of manpower. So he woke up like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wake up, there is no more power in the body, and he just lie quietly like a pile of rubbish. There were also several pastors in the middle to look at it, and he turned it over like a pile of pork to check the commentary. Finally, he moved here. Listening to Hamm and Stephen discussing how to use him as a material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only listens like this. I can't even turn my eyes. However, he is not too excited. No matter who he is, he can't escape from madness, he can't escape madness, he can't die, he can't die for a long time. His mind is not tough and can only be numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you give me another chance, give me another chance. If you give me another chance, give me another chance, give me a chance if I give me another chance. If one chance is one, if I... for dozens of days, his intermittent thoughts are all composed of repeated words. Although he knows that such an opportunity is really impossible, he has nothing but continuous repetition. Even his own person seems to be a monster made up of this illusory thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But like the day when the archangels appeared, the air once again swayed the majestic white magic. He suddenly felt that he could move. The ubiquitous power of Purdue beings in the Glorious Castle is also filled with his body. Although it is completely different from the Necromancer, this grand purely magical energy can still make him drive the body slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a little bit. This body is made of Necromancer magic after all. At best, it can only lift a small movement such as raising a hand. But this is enough, because at this time, he heard the necromancer say a word to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a way." Rodhart poked his fingers into his throat with all the power he could use, tearing the next piece of meat across his throat and saying. Although the strength is very small, but every inch of the body's muscles can control the insects more precisely than the insects' movements. The ligaments are not too complicated organs, and they do one thing for their own body control. Not difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Steve Flower heard the sound as if it had been stabbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's me." Rhodehart replied in a very awkward voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You?" Stephen frowned at the half of the ‘people’ on the ground, and he took a closer look to understand what was going on. "Sand did not clean your head and made you a Necromancer... Pudu sentients can make you move, you are lucky..." His eyes narrowed slightly, which is obviously a matter of knowing too. People with many things, but it seems to be a person who may be useful. "What did you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, I have a way." Lot said with his strangely made noise. "I have a way to make him a loyal man..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Stephen is interested in this half-dead knight who also has his own thoughts. Although Purdue has already begun, he does not mind waiting a little longer. "But I don't have much time, give you a minute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's actually very simple, let me do him. Not let me do him. The part is to exchange his parts for me and exchange that face for me. I will do it for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are still fifty seconds Stephen said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can say that during the operation, you suddenly found a way to treat the damage on his heart. It is directly treated. This Purdue magic is not As you can see, as long as you find a suitable reason, you can say that you have hurt the memory part during treatment. As long as I am careful, he will never find it. And I have no vocal cords with this other Necromancer. Can't talk, so the chance of revealing flaws is even smaller."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephen's eyes slightly, and nodded. He had to admit that it really meant something. It's just that although the danger is small, it is not without. "Thirty seconds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can put a magic spell in my head, so you can rest assured that I will not betray you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephen’s eyes are not only bright, but also slightly stunned, with a smile in it. He carefully looked at Rhodes Hart's full of scars. Like a patchwork face, I thought about it for a moment and said, "Ten seconds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhode Hetton paused, Shen Sheng continued "You should be able to see, because of what kind of person Hamm is. This person is too dangerous. If you can have a person who is completely unprepared, you are lurking around. Full control of all the movements of this person, maybe you You can also take control of him. Isn't it worth your gamble?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Stephen finally didn't count down, but just said: "Don't say those powerful relationships. I know better than you. But I know what I care about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I am jealous of you." Stephen smiled coldly. "The person who can be used by Shant to be a fear knight. The firmness of the mind, the viciousness of nature, are monsters far beyond ordinary people, and such monsters can have your mind like this, and will be dismantled as a part soon. I can still convince me so calmly, and the calmness of my heart is not under my mother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just don't want to die. No matter who is being piled up in the garbage heap for so many days, what feels numb." Rhode Hart replied faintly. He did not reveal the expression and tone of flattery and begging for mercy. Those who were impressed by these were all idiots, and only idiots would think that begging for mercy would be useful. That will only make people despise and even look down on it. He has said everything he can say, and the rest will wait for the other party to judge, and from now on, the Necromancer should have judged what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the madman who can grasp is not much better than the madman who can grasp. At least I know what you want." Stephen put Luo on his hand. Dehart's forehead. "If you are successful, I intend to work with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
