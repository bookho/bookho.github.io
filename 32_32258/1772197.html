			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is spacious and gorgeous and more stylish. Black heavy tables, chairs and furnishings all show a grand and serious atmosphere. It seems that the entire St. Peter's Cathedral sits in front of the condensed and steady sitting in the center of the cardinal like a god in the center of the church. He may have deliberately arranged his room like this, but the majesty that he scatters is indeed matched with his identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talis Knight This is why you let me wait here in the middle of the night?" The Cardinal frowned at the dying girl in front of her. His majestic and dignified eyes only swept away and received some of them. "She is just a shock that is caused by excessive scare. Although this situation is really serious, Celest should have three or four to treat her. It is necessary for people to use magical rumors to specifically ask me to come here to wait?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The status of the cardinal of Elazia can even be with Queen Catherine On the same night, on a stormy night, like a doctor, I am here to treat people for treatment. If it is not Talis, this is not the only apprentice of Lancelot, Essell will never have patience and good temper to sit here and She spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis quickly said: "Please forgive Master Asher. But there is a very complicated inside story behind this thing. I dare not take it." The girl brought to the teacher of Celebrity Lancelot is hurting me and I am inconvenienced. So bring her to you first to treat her first. I will report this to you first."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal frowned and nodded since the person has brought a look. He often inadvertently slows his movements a little and looks a little dignified. Even such an impatient look seems to imply the majesty of the gods. He looked at the girl who was demented and suddenly said that she had been chanting the same sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May the benevolent Lord to lower your mercy and shelter the fragile soul and life by the life of the believer...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The voice of the girl is very low. The sound is also very vague in her demented look as if it is a suspicious slang. But the word naturally carries a sad majesty. All the spirits of the girl, all the thoughts, all the minds are concentrated in the proverb that I don’t know how many times I repeat. Every word is not shocked by the soul when she speaks with her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the majesty of the Cardinal is that the artificially built cathedral is tall and majestic, the viewers are all over. The girl’s sentence is after hundreds of millions of years of sedimentation and then a stone lying on the river is unremarkable or even ugly, but the person who knows the true meaning will definitely move it. It is the shock of coexistence with the heavens and the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the prayer of God's protection." The Cardinal can't help but move. This spell is not really subtle in his eyes. But no one can turn a deaf ear to the spells that only the most convinced senior pastor can do all his life and magic. Aggregation is a bishop's magical career that has only seen a limited number of such magics for decades. His eyes suddenly looked at the girl's slow glance and suddenly the whole body shook aloud and said: "She..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you see? ?" Talis asked cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light in the eyes of Bishop Esshir flashed. Slowly nodded: "This girl was once rescued by the magic of God's protection. The situation must have been an abnormal horror. The blood was too scared and she caused her mental disorder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know?" Talis looked blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal smiles as if it is as majestic and compassionate as the statue on the high platform: "This is very simple and clear. This kind of person who stimulates excessive confusion is constantly repeating. If it is not the stimulus itself, it must be a big and direct connection with the stimuli that make her dysfunctional. And the magic of God's shelter is also very clear. You are also very clear that the person who protects her must be her close relatives who use this magic. It will not be within the guardianship of magic. It must have been killed before her eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The name of the Big Six First Mind Magician is well deserved "Talis is completely convinced." Although she knows that the mental magic of the Bishop of Ascher is very high, she does not think that it is just like seeing all the causes and effects at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as happiness and smug on Aescher’s face. Perhaps this sentence by Talis is not a compliment in his opinion. State the words of the truth. His eyes walked up and down the girl's body several times and then unknowingly moved to the upper right direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know when the girl in the room is whispering. The wind and rain outside the window are still fierce but this is spacious. The air in the grand room began to have a strange and heavy taste. Talis faintly felt a little uneasy but she didn't know where the uneasiness came from, or whether it was just the silence inside the house and the illusion of the storm outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very close thunder blasted away from the candlelight in the room and shook a few lights. Bishop Esshir finally looked back. After carefully looking at the girl for a while, I said, "If I didn't read it wrong, this girl should be a very talented magician. The magic of the elements can reach the level of the intermediate magician... The key is how I am in her body. I feel the fluctuations of white magic? From the time you want to quietly take her to see that she is not a believer and not a legitimate white magic user... Who else is sheltering the gods she uses? I remember not receiving it recently. This report says that any pastor has used this spell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis nodded and replied: "Yes. This is what I want to report to you." One. This girl... and her brother are actually raised by the former priest Relais of the Pythagorean parish, who was given the white magic by the professor of Relas, and this time the pastor of Relas is at a critical juncture. They saved their brothers and sisters with the protection of God."<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pingsburg...It seems to be one of the pastors who were removed from the priesthood when they were enthroned." Bishop Aescher snorted a thick nasal sound for a while. The wind and rain have concealed the past. "Even if he was dismissed from the priesthood but did not have permission to teach the sacred white magic to others, this is a serious violation of Celeste's rules. White magic is the magic that the Lord gives to believers to protect the light. The Lord's followers use white magic to be awkward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bishop, the old priest, although he was dismissed from the priesthood, did not waver in his faith. He was able to use The refuge of the gods is proof of the piety of the Lord. And this girl and her brother, I can guarantee their pure heart and character with the honor of the Knights of the Temple." Talis quickly screamed "and I want to report Behind this incident is a real embarrassment. You are allowed to finish the sacred white magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eschael Bishop Expressionless place Head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things are like this... This girl and her brother joined the Erasa Chamber of Commerce to the caravan of Oufu... On the night of the return... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight is very detailed. Everything seems to be what she sees." Bishop Essell is also listening, but perhaps he is too serious and too fascinating. The cardinal of the cardinal has no slight change in his face. He only looks at the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ability to use paralysis and even the gods of the heavens is at least a bishop. Although I am unbelievable, just in case I dare not take this girl to Celest easily. I will report it to you first..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talis Knight, do you think this story is true? Bishop Esshir suddenly interrupted the words of the horsewoman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." The female knight is stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A believer who serves the Lord is still the subject of the lord who gave the radiant light to the savage and ridiculous land to use the sacred white magic on several beasts. Just let them kill a group of businessmen who are full of copper smell..." The cardinal sighed a little and asked again: "Do you think this story is very reasonable? If these words are spoken from other populations, I will send him directly. Fire on the prison column."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight’s face rises a blush but it’s paused but the tone is not shaken: “He won’t lie to me and this girl. It can't be caused by other situations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He?" The cardinal seemed a bit surprised by this wording "Who? This girl's brother? That helped. Your young man?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Eschar is sitting up straight The body looks like a god in a blank expression and looks irresistible to the majesty and momentum of the female knight's eyes: "I saw it from your eyes. There should be some lost feelings. This is a fall for a knight who dedicated his life to the great justice and the Lord’s glory.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I don't have..." Talis's body was full of mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
