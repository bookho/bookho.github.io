			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am too young to see you." The voice of the Duke has no life at all, just spit out the words one by one. "You haven’t been wary of you since I’ve been asking for political affairs. I thought you were just like the ministers of the military, but they’re just those who have just enough brains. I can’t think of you, you can see some clues and still be in front of you. The original enemy negotiating coalition showed us a good show."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The people who play with power must be savvy. But those who don’t play with power Not all idiots," said the head of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke slowly nodded. ** Too strong will cover the mind. If you pay too much attention to something, you can't feel the whole picture of things and the subtle changes in them. When you are attracted by a leaf, you cannot see the entire forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is that he actually knows. However, it has been too addicted to chasing the wind for a long time in the power conspiracy. The eyes will only use the means of power to distinguish things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of Roland pointed to Asa. "Although I don't know much about the fact that his last member was killed by the Necromancer, I was suspicious of him. But I can at least see that the wound on the Bishop's adult is not like the one who will not use his sword. Pierced. Although you also cover up the wounds, but at least in my eyes, I want to cover them. Even if I am not sure you are definitely not him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The Duke smiled a bit. He himself felt that even the expression on his face was collapsing. "I actually forgot the eyes of the first swordsman of the empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's because your trap is perfect. So you don't need to care about other details." "Roland's head was faintly praised but there was no friendliness in his eyes. "The former Necromancer killed the autographed generals of the Bishops of the Paladins and there were hundreds of pastor's witnesses. Even if I saw that it was not appropriate, I only went down the road you arranged for me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, it would be a bit strange if the former bishop was not treating the Necromancer incident. Even if I was suspicious, I would never dare to go to a Necromancer. Negotiating the compromise will not be able to know the true insider of the wanted order. Since the wanted person will not be the murderer, there are not many people who are qualified to be the murderer in the whole king. Combining some clues and your performance at the scene. Seeing that I can almost certainly be sure that you are the murderer." The voice of the head of Rolander and his eyes together. "Why are you killing Bishop Ronis?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" The Duke smirked. "Because he is in front of me, I am also in front of him. He has to make a man first, so it is not that I am dead or he is dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am too lazy to say. Now you have control over the whole situation and you will know it." The duke sighed. "But even if you and the Necromancer join hands with your knowledge and means, you will definitely not be able to go this step." He slowly turned his head and looked at Rod Hart. The anger that was not betrayed in his eyes was only as frustrating as death. "There are a lot of them that are his arrangement. I just don't know how you can win him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are not wooing him but he chose to believe Friends and fairness.” Colonel Roland also looked at Rod Hart’s eyes and already had a thumbs up. "Just after I discussed with Mr. Andrew, I was suspicious that you didn't know how to proceed. He came to me. He told me that he believes his friend is not a spy of the Necromancer. He believes that this must be another. There is a hidden feeling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa looked at Rodhart quite a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the topic fell on himself, Rodhart’s still standing so straight is still so calm and calm to Asa’s still so sweet smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be aware that the person who dared to stand up and talk to a friend at that time must be a person with vision and confidence in his own judgment. So I believe that he told him what we suspected. It is his own advice to come to you for lurking. We can use your plan to push the boat. This is his credit."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His credit..." The Duke thought about the glory of the eyes that had failed and despair turned gray. It seems that a pool of quiet rot suddenly suddenly got a little irritating from the bottom to make some anger. He looked at Rod Hart. "I remember that you were participating in the battle of the Necromancer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the head of Roland, you said that you immediately found him after the battle and expressed your trust in your friend's fairness." The duke even recovered his voice. His mouth still showed a slight angle. It is a slight smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodha features a nod to sigh a little regret. "I only heard that the bishop of Dr. Ronis was too shocked when I received the order. There was too much scene at the time. I was also hesitant, so I didn't catch up with the fight between the head of the group and the old Mr. Sand. Fortunately, they themselves. Can distinguish the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke thought for a moment and nodded slowly. His expression is still sad and sad in Sui and Tang Dynasties. But it is no longer so lifeless. It seems that after thinking about the tactics that have long been part of his soul, he has found some interesting things. "I used to say that I know that you are a man with a vision and a city. But now I know that my evaluation of you is still low." He squeezed a bitter smile. "I thought I was raising a cat that hadn't become a tiger yet, but it was only a tiger that the cat wanted to swallow me. But I can still know that I am a little gratified because I am not so bad. Confusion is just a generation of newcomers to win the old man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry. I am not dealing with your Duke." The expression on Rodhart’s face is very serious and sincere. Like a child is expressing his own voice to adults. "I just do what I think I should do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good temper. Good vision." The Duke smiled and nodded. His smile is a bitter smile but it seems to be a bit of a heart. Like a loser in a wonderful and difficult hand, although defeated but not angry and hysterical, in addition to the frustration and loss of failure, there is also admiration for the opponent and even a little bit of respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s obvious that others can’t understand the deep meaning of his vision. The head of Roland’s sigh sighed that he seemed to feel a little regretful that the Duke’s enemy, who was difficult to deal with, was so quick to give up when he failed. "Actually, I didn't think you admit defeat when you saw us. I thought you would struggle to at least defend yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since you dare At the same time, it appeared in front of me, which means that I have no intention of giving me any room for struggle. Now there is no means and power to do anything in such an occasion. Can I not even see this?" The Duke looked at it lightly. The head of Roland and the face of Sandru swept. "With both of you killing me and killing a chicken, how much can I die like a chicken?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland Looking at the Duke’s silence for a while, he sighed: “In fact, it’s enough to use your cleverness to make a good name. It’s even more important that you don’t have to wait so hard for more than a decade. It will fall into your hands. Why do you need to go further and further on the road of power, and you will be able to bury yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke It’s awkward. Looking back now, it seems that it is. Wouldn't it be better if you didn't go further and further? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I thought about the Duke’s smile and shook his head. Impossible because I have already begun to go. Once a lot of things start, there is no way to stop. After the victory, there will be new goals and then continue to make progress. I want to keep going higher and stronger.... Finally... the Duke suddenly remembered a story that I told my daughter a long time ago. Once I put it on, I only kept dancing. Jump to the fairy tale of dead shoes. I am the human rights force and ambition that I like to dance. It is the magical shoes that make people crazy when they are put on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of Roland’s words interrupted the Duke’s thoughts: “You are wrong in ambition too much ** too strong.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said. I am not wrong, I am defeated." The Duke stood up and his voice completely recovered. "I am not wrong. I am not the first and not the last one on the road of power and ambition. I just failed and fell to the side of the road. There are other people behind me who follow my footprints and step on it. My body went higher.” The Duke’s eyes did not look to anyone but looked up at the ceiling. His face is as serious as a lonely believer mourning his own Bible. "The reason for my failure is that I am too proud to be too addicted to the power of power. If you are too strong, you will cover your mind. If you pay too much attention to something, you can't feel the whole picture and the subtle changes in it. It is attracted by a leaf. I can't see the whole forest. Only if I don't stick to my eyes, I can go farther by looking more broadly. I can get real power without pursuing indulge in power. My latecomers will learn my lesson. Going farther than I am."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke lowered his head and swept slowly on everyone's face and said calmly: "I will say that I am not wrong but just failed." He sat down again and picked up the fine sword on the table and turned to the sword. I inserted my chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa subconsciously stepped forward but he saw that Roland’s head and Sandro did not move and stood still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fine sword passed through the Duke’s body and emerged from the back and pierced the back of the chair and blood was continuously drenched on the chest. This sword passed through the center of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke with a trace of painful expression sighed. He greeted Asa’s strange eyes and said with a bit of a painful voice: “In fact, sometimes I’m thinking about people like you who don’t care about anything. Although it’s stupid, it’s really easy. ......" As the chest and the red on the back of the chair continued to expand the Duke's voice, the head slowly hanged down. Finally he died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study is very quiet except for Sandro, everyone looks at the body of the Duke who is still sitting there with a different look. After a long while, Asa suddenly asked: "Why should he let him commit suicide?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He will die anyway. Suicide is the same." Colonel Roland answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't mean this. I mean he died like this. We can't get any evidence that others will believe that he killed the bishop?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Others will naturally not believe. There is no need to believe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa 楞: "That...I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm sorry." Although I was sorry, but the head of Roland looked at Asa's eyes, it was calm, as if there was no Sorry. "You are still wanted. The crime of killing the bishop is still detained on you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Asa couldn’t figure out that the culprit had already given this The black pot cannot be removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The reputation of the Duke of Mulak is good both in the opposition to the wilderness. His power is also great. You know this."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." Asa nodded. The reputation of the Duke is not only good, but with the combination of his current powers, he has almost become the common goal of the ascendants and ambitions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we suddenly announce that he is actually the murderer of the murder of Bishop Dr. Ronis, then the ruling and the opposition will definitely be in a state of disappointment. One is in such a way that everyone is so clear and honest. What happens when an image suddenly bursts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." Asa shook her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"External. This is the big scandal of the empire. The reputation of the empire will be affected by the relationship between the church and the empire. The trust of the small officials and the imperial courts will plummet. The officials and merchants who were originally attached to the Duke under the turbulence of the people will not be able to say that they will definitely be unfavorable to the empire. Therefore, the news that the Duke is actually the murderer cannot be spread. Only people here know enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I have to give him a black pot." Asa frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry." Colonel Roland sighed and seemed to be a little bit eager to look at Asa. "In fact, I don't want you to be caught. After all, such a large amount of reward is not a small burden on the empire's national treasury."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Anyway, you are also It’s no big deal to get used to it all night.” Shandru glared at him with a glance. "And this wanted order is good for you either. If I remember correctly, the gang of the Necromancers seems to be chasing you. This wanted order can help you keep your vigilance at all times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed incompetently and replied, "Okay. Anyway, my refusal is useless. But since the Duke is not killing the murderer of Bishop Ronis, how can you explain his death?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it was killed by you." Roland’s head said faintly. "In any case, you have already been carrying such a heavy crime. You should not care about this one. Don't worry, this is just a temporary expediency. We will help you to cleanse these charges after the time is ripe."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
