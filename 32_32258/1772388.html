			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flying a long distance on the open space full of corpses rolled over a dozen heads because Hamm stopped. He steadily supported the words of the upper half of the work and the sequel. "It's amazing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this sentence, there is still a lot of blood. There are some fragments of lungs in the blood. His chest was almost completely concave and the front ribs were all broken. If it wasn't for him, he would wear a ghost king's cloak. If it wasn't for him, he would feel the danger in a moment, and the agile can't escape with the ordinary magician. You can put him in the right place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer Manipulation regulates the dead muscles of the visceral white magic and finally heals the wound. Because Hamm looked up before the hall, it was already a red light and could not be seen. The bloody Changhong has changed into a large group of red light curtains that have been swallowed up and wrapped all the people there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drink." A big drink from the red light, all the people who heard it were shocked as if this glorious castle was also shaking in this drink. A shake. Then a large group of white light blasted from the red light curtain as if it had condensed thousands of angers and thundered in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment when the light breaks through the red light curtain, you can see a few of them. The most conspicuous one is the Gru who blasted the punch. The dazzling white light is mixed with the leaf-like emerald green radiance. At this moment, the red light curtain around it is also stunned. This is his full force. It is no longer just bombarding the air. It also uses all the power and vindictiveness. It’s not just that you want to open the blood of this group, but you also need to kill the inferior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s just a moment when the bloody waves of the blood suddenly squirmed and squeezed to completely drown him. This is the power that transforms the vitality of thousands of people with the most advanced necromancer magic. Only the white group of vindictive gangs roared with the hustle and bustle of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the incomparable rush, because Ham is not too flustered, although he is no matter what kind of magic shield is under this temperament and thin There is no difference in paper. Although he is now even a problem with moving. But it does not mean that he has no way at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the movement of the finger will involve the injury of the chest. It’s really painful, but because Hamm is still flying, it’s a weird handprint with both hands. The sash made of pieces of a star in the chest shines and then disappears in the next moment. This group of spirits plowed a trench in the ground and hit a house on the edge of the square. The whole building was like a dozen thunder bombs hitting and smashing at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue ray flashed as Hamm’s figure reappeared on the other side of the square. His face that was already exhausted was even more embarrassing. It seems to be the same as a person who has just struggled for three days and three nights without a close eye for a second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Space conversion. This is the genius of Akibad’s space spells. It’s also the last life-saving spell that can only be used by the necromancer who has been in the dark for hundreds of years. It’s just that this is not only dangerous but also to the Necromancers. The body has a lot of damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Hamm took out the last bit of strength and took out a transfer magic scroll from his arms. At this time, his magician has already smashed dozens of magical swordsmen nearby. But the blue light that transmits magic in the intensive explosions and magical flames is still invincible and waits until the swordsmen rush. There is only one empty space left with traces of magical bombardment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Light Hall, the light curtain was surrounded by priests. The white magic purification that deals with other magical unfavorables does not work in front of this bloody red light. Even the common red blood of hundreds of pastors is still me. Many people are yelling at Lancelot and the people in the middle but have no response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody red light curtain is still rolling and the range is getting smaller and thicker and getting more and more squeezed towards the middle. The people around me seem to be able to immediately hear the broken voice of the people in the middle. But there are also talents in the middle. There are two priests who have tried to cut them with swords. But the swordsman has just touched the red light. It seems that there is a huge suction in the visible and tangible red light. The two god officials even pulled the sword directly into the light curtain. The screams were just the people who had just opened their heads and watched the two men fly into the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc in the center of the square did not change but was carefully guarded by the surrounding swordsmen under the constraints of several leaders. The heads of several orc heads are already awake. They understand that the insults are just looking for their own death. But if this group of red light really swallows all of them, they are also dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long for Mr. Hamm to wake up and the injury quickly improved after he used the healing magic. After indicating that all others left, only he and the queen were left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Glorious Castle is over." Inham said faintly. "Magnus Lancelot has more than a dozen cardinals all dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The Queen was shocked but surprised. More and more surprises emerge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oufu used the different door to break into the glorious castle. Both sides of the battle are badly hurt. Oufu's two collars are all dead even if Europe Fucheng can continue to exist for ten years. It can't be any climate. You can have no worries. In the country, there is no one in the kings of Erassia. No one is your opponent. Just be careful to help you to be a pope. It’s not that difficult...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the words of Hamm, there are two fires in the eyes of Queen Catherine and it’s getting more and more bright and even breathing It’s up. She quickly took a deep breath and calmed down and said: "The position of the Pope is of course yours. Now, don't worry about saying that you still have to raise your wounds first..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can rest assured that I am not interested in that position. And I mean this means... I am finished with your use. You are the heart of your queen, I will not bother you again."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you talking about..." Catherine's five-browed brows in the sorrowful color of the horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the future, you have to be busy with your country's big things. I probably have to go to the far industrial area to avoid a guy who can't afford it. There are not many opportunities for us to meet in the future. It’s no problem to explain this at a glance.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You...we...” The Queen’s face is ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to give up Elassia and go with me?" Inham suddenly looked at Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen’s expression froze and her eyes flickered for a moment and then sighed and then regained the look that was indifferent and reversed. "That... thank you very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inham also sighed and both of them silenced for a long while and he asked: "The young man who just sent it. Where did the people go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" The Queen sneaked. "You haven't used a magical array before..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Because Hamm jumped out of bed, his body suddenly shook his head and turned to turn his head. I was scared in my eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong? There is nothing there..." The Queen looked at the place where Hamm was watching. It was just a wall without a strange appearance but he looked there. The eyes are like a horrible demon is coming out from there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the fear in Ham's eyes is getting more and more heavy, it seems that even the reason is completely covered. He still ran down in the direction of his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How could it..." It seems to be embarrassing from his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old pastor in the Magic Academy Library thousands of miles away is also slowly squatting in one direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three well-dressed husbands in Descartes are also squatting. Their faces are also different but they are not as good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical red light that had been engulfing everything on the square of the Bright Hall of the Glorious Castle of Celest has disappeared. Just now when everyone was helpless, this group of magical red light suddenly inexplicably poured into the hall as if a giant beast had sucked a big gas and ate the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one here has everyone looking at the Great Hall of Light. Although they couldn't see anything, they all felt the feeling of coming out of the hall like a tide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overwhelmed everything that overlooks everything and ignores everything. That is the breath of the breath of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this breath, all the people from the deepest part of the soul of the trenches and shocks feel their own powerlessness. Whether it is a devout pastor or a violent orc face, the expression is the same despair fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
