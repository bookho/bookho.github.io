			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will give you a advice elf chick, don't force me, especially me now." Master Eden's eyes jumped and the two pieces of jade on the jumper also Jumping around the air together seems to be a lot stronger. "Even that's okay, after the leaves of the world tree are broken, it will re-converge in the sun well for more than a decade. I just use these two big magics to kill the elves. Or I killed the kid and went to the king to kill the one." The women who used to take the leaves of the world tree are all the same. The leaves of the world tree will not disappear, I can't get it now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Now I am not threatening you to give yourself a choice." Master Aiden took a deep breath. He was suppressing the fire that his heart was about to explode. It seems that even the words that spit out have a strong smell of fire. "Come on, I have no patience and time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression on Luya’s face is constantly changing. She vaguely felt that the necromancer in front of him was not joking but asked her to hand over the sacred objects of the elves, which could not be done anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not just her own submission but the submission of the entire Elf. The faith that the entire elves have been guarding has all been attached to the leaves of this world tree. This leaf is handed over to the Necromancer, which represents the complete destruction of the elves' faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the meaning of faith not being there? Luya bit her teeth, a silver show, no wind. She looked at the air in the air. Aiden went up and said, "Don't think about it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Well, I will give you the leaves of the world tree." Luya suddenly felt that the leaves of a light world tree had reached the hands of Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be excited, I know you are not kidding. I don't want to die and I don't want the elves here to be blown up." Asa sighed. Waving the leaf of the world tree. "But how do you guarantee that you can use the two reels after you take this thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing? That is the sacred object of our elves." Luya jumped up. When you reach out, you can grab the leaves of the world tree in Asa’s hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid. Can't you see that this old man is going crazy? Don't you want to die?" Asa reached out and pushed her away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the fear of death?" Luya rushed over again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, you are not afraid of me." Asa swayed through her black magic wave and swept through the body of Luya. She immediately froze. The effect of Necromancer on the body is not as convenient as the paralysis of white magic. Especially when dealing with people whose strength is not so strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The kid I warned you not to play tricks." Although Aiden’s master said so, his expression was slightly loose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa raised his hand and the leaves of the world tree and smiled a bit and said: "Please feel free to see what you are now dead. All can be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aydin Master’s eyes jumped again. He didn't know if it was happy or annoyed. Reluctantly said: "But I remember that you don't seem to be afraid of death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled and shook his head and said: "No one is not afraid of death. Those who don’t know what dying is, and those poor worms that don’t live well... You should see. It’s not like these two people. Is it? I am still young and have a lot of time and enjoyment. Waiting for me...so I don't want to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also you are still young and not the kind of ignorant idiot you still have a great life... ..." Master Eden looked at Lucia, who was there, and his expression was slightly relieved. "This elf chick is really beautiful. If I am young for decades. I don't want her to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The right pair. You can understand it... ..." Asa seems to be a little embarrassed and seems to smile a little bit slyly. "Let's use a fair approach. I put the leaves of the world tree on the ground. You put the two scrolls on the ground and turn them around each other. You can get the leaves of the world tree. I got those two. How can small things guarantee my own safety?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Aiden frowned slightly. These two jade pieces are not something that can be easily discarded by him. He and Nimbas Esri spent a lot of time to find out the magical gems that could seal the curse and then the three people together and invited some other necromancers to help. Cursor scroll. These magic stones with the effect of the curse reel are the only treasures on the big 6 Putting it elsewhere is definitely enough to provoke war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Aiden landed blankly on the ground and dropped two pieces of jade in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa first pushed Luya down the distance and threw the leaves of the world tree on the ground. The two slowly moved in a mutually opposite arc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed a very old and effective way to exchange things. The distance between the two sides in the reverse rotation will not change, but it will gradually approach the things to be exchanged. Regardless of the sudden failure of either party, the other party has enough time and distance to get something closest to itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the previous battles, both of them also understand that the mutual explosion is actually almost the same as the combat power, and no one can instantly defeat each other. So the best way to do it now seems to be that there are no tricks to get what you want with each other. Of course, their movements are naturally very slow, very slight and very steady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly both of them have reached the same distance as the half of the set arc route that two people are exchanging from the ground. When the lines between the two people and the two things to be exchanged form a square, the two suddenly have actions at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa suddenly looked up at the back of Master Aden as if he suddenly saw something amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Aiden suddenly raised his hands and grabbed the things on both sides of the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kid is playing these old patterns in front of me? Master Aiden naturally saw Asana's expression, but he did not move at all and only smirked. Under the sham of his hands, the leaves of the world tree and the two jade pieces flew into his hands at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Aiden does not believe that the opposite boy is sincerely exchanged. The key point is that he himself did not think about exchanging after hearing this exchange method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This distance is indeed the best distance for hands-on. Both sides are the same distance from both sides. As long as the method is effective, there is a chance that both sides will retreat. . This point, Master Aiden knows that the opponent must know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows what the opposite kid will definitely play, but no matter what kind of tricks in the case of such exchanges, what kind of tricks can be compared to a master of air magic Can it be said that the master's trick is more effective? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to grasp the things on the ground with this genius in this place. Aiden Master feels that he is cautious enough and careful. At the same time, his figure is also rushing upwards and eager to shoot the fireworks of the sky. He knows the degree of the kid opposite him. He knows that he is absolutely too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the kid’s face was so surprised that he immediately rushed to himself before the knife, although he had to say that it was indeed fast enough but It’s no doubt that it’s too late to attack yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master's singularity is to pull two things on the ground that are still, not too big, not heavy, to the hand. Grasping must be steady and fast. The leaves of the world tree and the two jade pieces have been pulled by the airflow to the hands of Master Aiden in an extremely fast manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was finally a green leaf that felt the vitality and magical power of the above-mentioned fullness. Ai Deng’s heart could not be used to satisfy the joy. The words of mediocrity are described. He almost felt like he was going crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, I rushed to the knives and slashed into my own arm and then pulled out the knife and jumped on the knife. Extreme bloody light. Master Aiden feels that the subtle death of the magical magic and the seemingly unique taste of the vampire is the power of his own half-hearted spirit. I am afraid that even the monster-like war. I can't stand such a blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is no more powerful attack that can be attacked to work. It seems that this kid wants to use this kind of killing after he is tempted by his eyes to distract himself. It’s a pity that the trick is too old-fashioned. It’s impossible to get the distance of his own heart. He can’t stop himself anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once at high altitude, Master Aiden is confident that even if all the strong players above the Big 6 gather, he can retire. Master Aiden can almost hear his blood because of the excitement and the sound of boiling. The pleasant feeling of success in the hope makes him feel at least twenty years younger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
