			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot frowned, from the outside guards and priests, it really is not like the dragon has gone. And he believes that since Tima spent ten years preparing for the investigation, he said that the dragon should be here absolutely here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The dragon, get out." Stoge once again danced the huge axe in his hand. This completely unexpected situation turned his full-fledged fighting spirit and blood into anger, which was not only the anger of the transformation of war, but also the fear of the unknown. He didn't know what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roll...." snorted again, and Stoic’s head suddenly shattered. The bones and fragments of the sky spread out together with the blood of the brain. The two horns were perfectly turned around in the air for two laps and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Othello’s battle has not subsided yet, and it is getting stronger and stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tauren warriors are no longer just guarding the Tema high priests on the high platform, they all waved their axes and rushed to the black elves, slamming and fighting. The mega chivalry hits together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The axe slashed into the body of the juvenile, and the rifle of the Black Elf Knight on the slash also penetrated the key of the Tauren warrior. A big mouth is a big piece of meat. However, the screams of the screaming blood and the mad spurt of the two actually did not fall, but further cut down, then stab, and then bite. Huge vitality is extremely tenacious, and the Tauren warriors are not weak, and the semi-crazy state in the battle makes their endurance multiply. It is often necessary to wait until Jue is cut into meat, the knights on the top are pulled down by the Tauren, and the Tauren warrior is also stabbed in the body. The hole is like a sieve, and almost no whole good meat can be found. The two sides have fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two powerful melees have caused the human army to suffer in the battle with Elazia. Now they are strangling together, they are completely two groups. The meat mixers are stirring each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil eyes and eagle owls floating in midair do not have much advantage now, and the black elf's strong bow can also hurt them. Especially the huge arrows on the brakes. Slowly moving evil eyes under this machine to complete all balloons in midair. When an arrow is shot, it will open one. Medusa also joined the battle group. Although the actions of these snake-haired banshees were slow, the bows and arrows in their hands were strange, and the eagle owls kept falling down. The Tauren warriors are not too afraid to fight with this long-distance archer. The gaze in the close range can make people petrified. Even the Minotaur's physique can't resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic is no longer a performance of the Tema Grand Priest, fireballs, ice arrows, venom, flames, flying around. A large area of ​​bloodthirsty, cursing, and weak light are also shining. The Tauren priests and the Black Elf priests performed spells to attack each other's soldiers. The ruins of Othello in the square have now completely evolved into battlefields, shouting and screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tima High Priest stood on the high platform and looked down at the battle scene below. His face was very unsightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuhana’s mother has been lying under his feet, and her hands and feet have been broken. /?u=109443<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pocket. Where is the problem?" Tima high priest screamed. /?u=109443<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do I know. You are not saying that your plan is foolproof?" The Chief of the Bullerley was also thunderous, and all her ethnic groups participated in this. After the battle, watching a eagle screaming screaming by Medusa, the feathers flew down from the air, she could not wait to smash the two priests. /?u=109443<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them are next to a quietly floating eye. The size of the eye is bigger than other evil eyes. And it's not just the big eye in the center that can emit a burning ray, there are a few smaller eyeballs around. This is the leader of all evil eyes, although his big eyes are surrounded by several small eyes. This is the leader of all evil eyes. Although his big eyes have an equally huge mouth, they can't talk. This kind of monster can only communicate with the mind, and the feeling of disgust that comes from it can be judged. It is also dissatisfied with the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the Othello forces that were bombarded by magic, but the black elves and Medusa reinforcements who came from all over the place. . Othello’s troops were in fact vulnerable to the Tauren’s troops, even though they intended to break out. But it was quickly defeated under the early preparation of the Tauren. Even Cuihana’s mother was caught alive. The black elves who rushed around for help did not leave, and the Thamma priest planned for ten years, and naturally would not have imagined this. Although the sneak peeks of these black elf scouts are already very advanced, they are still exposed in the eyes of the eye-catchers waiting for the main roads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the Thamma priest is uneasy. The Knights of the Temple seem to have not heard any movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You three of these gits, may the dragon of the shadows put your soul into the body of the locust, and tumbling in the cave of the cave for a lifetime." The mother of Cuihana on the ground is hoarse and still screaming. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no need to pray for the dragon of the shadows, even the leaders of Morrill are coming to bring me back." "The Tema High Priest stepped on the foot of Cuihana's mother, and Cuihana's mother gave a sharp scream. No bones broke, the huge body and hoof in the Tauren." Underneath, the little elf's petite bones and biscuits are no different, even the broken pieces are broken silently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agitated for a while, Cuihana Lord The mother has not yet passed out, struggling to ask: "After more than a decade ago, did you destroy the seal of the great Moriel? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides your black elves themselves, who dares to walk into that dragon?" I just took advantage of it. I know that Morrill must have been uncomfortable for ten years. "The Tima High Priest smiled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't the great messier's messenger teach you to leave Nigan?" There are only a few elders in this matter who know that if Moriel’s messenger is still there, you will never have the courage to do so...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if, if there is no such thing in the world. "The rear hoof of Tima fell on the head of Cuihana's mother, and it was not too hard. It just happened to kick her out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The battle has slowly begun to become clear. After all, the Tauren people have taken advantage of the number and combat power, and they have begun to gain the upper hand. And the reinforcements from the rear have basically arrived. Although the win has been heavy, after all, look It still wins.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tima High Priest looks at the eagle and the demon, saying: "The battle here is a bit of a scorpion, but still We have the upper hand. I have sent people to send cave man slaves. I solved the problem of going to the Black Elf and Medusa's nest right away. And don't worry about Morial, the church knight is enough to deal with him. The seven men are the elite of the church. As long as they are with Mori, then we are the biggest winner. Whether it is the unity of Nigan's forces, or the strength of the church that we face when we attack the surface, the profit is ultimately ours. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know that they will die together?" Neither side is a fool, not what we can deal with. "Roller asked half-heartedly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have my own way, they are just the pieces on my board." "The Tauren priest smiled like a statue of a demon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also sent fifty of the most elite warriors with them. Do you not want them? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Want to get, there must be a corresponding effort." To eat the seven most precious pieces of the church, it doesn't seem to matter if you sacrifice five or sixty. Even the son is the same. "Tima smiled, this smile didn't want the Tauren, like a human.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"吱嘎? "The eyebrows twitched and slammed, and the head-sized eyes looked at a rock wall not far away. It kept shaking its strange body from side to side, seemingly looking for something, only to find it at this time." .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lolere and Tima the high priest glanced, his eyes also looked with the eyes of Ken De.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small eyeballs around the main eye of the eye are lit together by the low light, and they fall on the rock wall. The place where the original wall is the rock wall immediately appears.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that it was a person, both Basile and Tima were surprised, then they immediately recognized that this was one of the seven Knights of the Temple, and immediately became shocked. And then I can see a little bit more about what this person's hand is holding, especially when Tima can feel the magical fluctuations that are emitted, and it is already horrified at once.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quickly stop him, stop him." "The Tema Grand Priest also shouted like the recent Cuihana mother.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stoge is the commander of the horned demon temple, only the Tauren The first warrior is qualified to take up this position. Although intelligence is not as smart as other Tauren, the combat power is absolutely beyond doubt, and the wheels in his hands are often cut with Erasia and the church for many years. The skull of the Knights of the Temple.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
