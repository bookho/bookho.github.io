			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Vedena Schaffer, Hamm is not just looking around as he said before. He really did his best to stop her. From the lowest level of magical missiles to the high-level magical fire wall and even the white magic purification and light archery, he has almost released all available spells in a short period of time. It’s a pity that all the spells he cast were dissipated on a layer of black-wrapped shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, he didn’t even use the spells but rushed straight to think of the sorcerer’s spells like Egrenair’s melee attack. But he was immediately bounced back as soon as he installed this layer of magic shield. Although he can be considered to be very good, but the gap from Ai Greiner can not be described by the magnitude of the word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not give up but accumulated all the power to rush again. This time, he was not bounced back, but the whole person was inlaid into the black atmosphere. The magic around him was madly squeezed. If it wasn’t for him, he would pull himself out, but this shield would turn him into a ball. Minced meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vadina did not care that he was exhausted by this layer of bodyguard magical shield. At this time, the green flame spewed out by the Dark Dragon has completely overwhelmed Sandron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cyan dragon did not disappear but flew back in mid-air. This is no longer an illusion but a similar creature to the elemental creature. When it flew back to Ved Nina and Inham’s head, it was another overwhelming flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green flame burns and melts all the touched cliffs on both sides of the cliff. After the flame, there was only a hot black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vadina and Inham are still standing. It’s just that the lich’s body is within a few meters of the moon, and all the innocent grounds are still cool, because Hamm is awkward and not only the clothing on the body has a trace of burnt black. It looks like a survivor who has just escaped from the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How. Can't bear to kill me?" Because Hamm is still laughing. He is well aware that it is impossible to live in such an operation by his own ability. But now he is not just a wolverine. The dark fluctuations contained in the flames are violently ravaged in his body, eroding vitality and magical power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich is silent. Except for the fire in the eyelids, it is no different to jump her and the statue. After a long while, she said with a hoarse voice: "Now you are not worth killing me. I want you to see the king of the dead spirit rise here to turn you into a dust."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sandru, are you willing to kill?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't keep my hands but maybe he was just seriously injured And... maybe... if he can really be alive, I will let him see the greatness for a moment.” Ved Nina talked. After all, this was thought to be the strongest necromancer and the teacher who led him into the field of Devil Valley and Necromancer. She knew her strength. Even the dragon of darkness is close to the curse of the dragon. Maybe there is really no way to kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when she focused on the place where the flame was burned, nothing happened. There is no trace of the existence of a mountain, and it seems that this person has been smouldering in the dragon's dragon's breath like all other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Impossible... there are ghosts inside." Vidnina stunned. But then she will understand. A man like Sand. Even if it is dead, it is impossible to die so silently and silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the limit of sight, a gargoyle body pulled up from the valley to the northwest. Although I can't see clearly. But Vadina knows that there must be someone above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fast gargoyle can’t fly so far in such a short time. This is at least long before she’s out of the Dark Dragon. Already moving forward in the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a teacher. It seems that I have to learn a lot of things..." Ved Nina sighed heartily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not an old man." Inham also felt a bitter smile. "It turns out that I don't need to be passionate about it. He knows how to do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as 20 years ago, Ai Ruiruier and Sandrud had the same acquaintance with the two sides of the Diwei Valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scroll of the master-level mirroring avatar plus the proper performance and the help of Ai Rui Ruier, Shandru actually sneaked from the eyes of the two men out. This distance is already a few dozen miles away. Even if I look for the same gargoyle, I can't catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, the teacher did not think that I have this. This is not as good as the day." Ved Nina does not need to find a gargoyle. Gargoyles are bigger and more convenient mounts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cyan dragon hovering over their heads bowed down. Although it is only a long time to summon the creatures, although it still depends on the smell of the black star to maintain the shape and can not leave the shadow mountain. When this is the dragon of darkness, whether it is combat power or degree is not a stone ghost, this magical couple is comparable. of. Vadrina is confident enough to catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But just because she was just about to get up and fly on the dragon, Inham suddenly laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughs happily like he has just encountered the most enjoyable thing in the world. He laughed: "I still want to help me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed and coughed out his mouth from the mouth. But he did not care, but instead sang the prayer of white magic, but his prayer was not the same as any pastor sang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The imaginary Lord let me be a devout believer to borrow your strength. Use your hospice to purify this real darkness as purifying us. The same is true of your own heart..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the prayer, there is a large white light that is white in the world that has been completely shrouded in darkness. It looks dazzling. This is a purifying exercise by a bishop-level white magician who pours all the magical vitality into one point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shape of the blue dragon in the dazzling white light collapses in the flying air like a complete building suddenly being pulled out of the girders. Even if there is a lichter-like manipulator, even if there is a dark star as its magic source, this purification has destroyed the huge magic system that constitutes its body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Globe." A fascinating anger was heard from the lich's throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A green flash of light flashed in the air and a loud hole was heard in Hamm’s chest. Transparent before and after, a big hole that almost splits him into two can make a person drill from the front to the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Hamm is still laughing, there is no laughter. No blood from the huge wounds, the high temperature of the green fire almost heats your ** directly, and the black suffocating atmosphere can make any body that comes into contact with coal. But this is actually not important. That purification is enough for him to succeed. Just as he cast a spell at the same time, he lost his body and destroyed his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich in midair looked at the hand that had stretched out and the hand that had just made the attack. Can't see her expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Death in your hands is the best ending I can choose now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the last word of the lich’s remnant in the spirit of the body, Hamm said this last sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cyan dragon has disappeared and Vedina slowly descended from the air. Maybe the magic power is not enough. Maybe it's another reason. She didn't try to summon a dark dragon just to look at Inham, who has become a dead body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich’s face still can’t see any expression, just stand still and watch for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gust of wind blew through the body of the Marquis of Hamm. The wind also blew a bit of the hay on the face of the lich, but the muscles of the dead were just alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the Shadow Mountain. In the past, the sun was shining in the desert, but the sky was gray. But this piece of gray is much better than the mountains. A gargoyle is flying alone in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
