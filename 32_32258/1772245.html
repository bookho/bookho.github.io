			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor and the magician are undoubtedly the first to feel the breath of this huge corpse, they are also the earliest, but they did not shoot because To the head of Roland and the emperor are on top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first melon of this time is that the heads of Emperor Sui and Roland have been hijacked or controlled. Whether they are controlled or hijacked, although every pastor and magician here is already a master of excellence, they also understand that they have absolutely no strength to save two from the hands of a Necromancer. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when they saw the head of Roland’s face murderous and angry, watching the priests leaping down from the corpse monster, others saw it. He was neither controlled nor hijacked. So all the people were stunned by the fact that the things in their brains suddenly became a large paste or a paste that had to be solidified for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the emperor also walked down the huge body with the Necromancer and clearly stood under the Emperor of the Necromancer and the Undead Monster. The cardinal in the hall of the temple shouted: "Everyone is careful that this cardinal is actually a necromancer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that my brain is already condensing The people who became solid again heard this feeling that their brain was not condensed but broken. I don't know how to think, but I don't even think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not the reaction of everyone at least the Cardinal. When he heard the voice of the Necromancer, he immediately froze, but the next moment he saw the head of Roland jumped from the body and watched himself step by step, his body immediately moved again. . And even faster than the shots just under the wrath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time he did not re-sword, but regressed from the side of the four Paladins to take a step and picked out the reel from his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four squad leaders are still in the state of chaos and the cardinal moves too fast. They also have no time to respond at all. When they were shocked, a roll of dark scrolls had been in the hands of the Cardinal, and the black magical fluctuations were also formed on the side of the reel and waited for the reel to unfold. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolander’s face when he saw Javi’s retreat from the reel was completely changed from step by step to an urgent image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer with a golden mask certainly saw that the scroll naturally no one could see his face but his movements were immediately back. After one step, the emperor was dragged to his back and the huge corpse monster was quickly blocked in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic sealed in the scroll is far more effective than the magic itself in actual combat. This kind of props can be used without the need for gestures and mourning spells for a very short time. It can be used inside. And the cost of making the top magic scroll is usually amazing. But once you have this thing, there is no doubt that there is enough ace to reverse the battle at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the bishop of Jia Wei is undoubtedly such a trump card. However, people around the world simply did not realize what the situation was. The leader of Roland had already reacted, but there were so many people in the distance. At this time, the reminder time is enough to open three reels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javier’s hand holding the reel can already feel the thick and inconspicuous fluctuations in the reel, and it will immediately rush to the most wonderful way of resonance. The most profound magical technique bursts with a huge amount of lethality. As long as the hand is unfolded, the person in front of him will be crushed by magic like an ant. Although the strongest ones may not be killed, the two most taboos may not suffer multiple injuries, but this has given them a chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but just as this scroll will unfold. He also felt the momentum and airflow from behind his head. It is an unstoppable momentum of a flat wind and thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may still be able to unroll the reel. Explode all the magical power of the meaning of it. Just maybe. But at the same time, this group of momentum and airflow can definitely turn his head into a rotten tomato that flies out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short stoop jumped out of the volley and rolled forward with a sword to block all the backlash. Bishop Javey landed and he finally escaped the blow from behind. He also did not have time to unroll the scroll. Because this person rushed up again. The black knife in the hand of the man was originally calm and dignified. The granite that has been in the ages is now pressed all over him. This is actually a mountain that collapsed. If you don't try to resist the impact of the past, you will only be crushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the swordsmen behind him also received the prime minister and queen who flew over. The two of them were thrown over by people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa screams and quits a few steps and spits out a blood. In the first time, the first reaction to stop the cardinal is also to absorb energy. It is. However, he suffered from a light injury in the first hit, which made him even worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s enough. Even if I have already defeated Asa, there is still no way to use the dark scroll of the shot. Because it was just such a short delay, the head of Roland had arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The good apprentice turned out to be you." First, this kind of sinking and then a white sword light a figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece of Jianguang has nothing like the inner impact of the mountains and the sea without any fluctuations. This is a sword is a sword. This is a very pure sword. The figure of the sword is also like a sword. His eyes are sharper. It seems that the sword even has a low drink and is like a sword that is very straightforward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Bishop Jia Wei, there is already a look of fear. I don't know if he saw such a sword and the horror still saw the person holding the sword or the person holding the sword or the low drink. He did not have the slightest sense of resistance but turned and fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a sword, even Gru, would not dare to use his back to back, but Javi dare. And the direction he fled was actually a wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of sword is never possible to escape. It’s just that the archivist of Jia Wei has just started. The sword has already stabbed him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a sword makes sense that there is nothing to resist. That is the combination of the temperament and the strength of the sword. Even if it is the body of the legendary dragon, it will only be as soft as the pork, no matter if it is strong and strong, even if it can withstand the sword. The sword will also smash through the tears of all the vitality inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this sword did not play any role for Bishop Javey. When Jian Feng was about to touch his body, a layer of white and black mixed magic light flashed on him. A strange impulsive sound, this layer of strange magical light actually blocked Roland's sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time there is another subtle cracking sound. The cross on the chest of Bishop Jia Wei was also broken and scattered into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guardian of the Holy Light Angel?" Good guy! "The necromancer of the golden mask outside the temple has a strange scream." This thing has only two of the flutes of the year, but I am not willing to use it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this sword has been blocked, the impact is still there. The head of Roland’s body is a forward of Bishop Javi. The escaped body is the wall that rushes forward to the front.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the priest who has a sword and wants to escape at all The wall is naturally not an obstacle. The wall in front of the sword flashed in front of him, and the wall instantly collapsed. His figure was fired out and then he waved a sword back and the larger wall fell and just blocked. The body of the head of Roland, behind him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a night out, Javey immediately added a few auxiliary white magic figures to the court room. Run away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run him now only has this thought. He knows that he has no chance to win. But he still has confidence in running away. Sacrifice that The jewel that the father left for his body magical gem got the chance to rush out of the temple. Just drill into a slightly hidden place for a person to delay The few seconds it took to use the transfer volume was enough.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His figure was a little delayed and the delay of the head of Roland’s head was really I can give him enough opportunities. It’s a pity that he forgot another person.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Cardinal broke the wall and died, the death outside the hall Ling Master also snorted, but he did not chase but turned and jumped on the huge corpse monster corpse monster also violently spread his wings and flew into the air.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The necromancer in the high air golden mask stared coldly at the flying cardinal and reached out and grabbed it gently. This is a very slight and random movement.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
