			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sense of keenness makes Asa know that his combat power is not in a grade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Gru seems to be just standing there casually without any special posture and with his hands behind him. It seems that I just watched Asa while watching a chick without the slightest danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Asa feels that it is facing a wild beast in an ancient mystery. The momentum that lurks in an easy-going posture is as sharp as a sword. It seems that the real face of a huge madness can be exposed at any time, and all the enemies in front of it are torn and smashed and swallowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the action of the other party, there is no chance of winning. The layer of white light film that covers him is not magic but another force that is simpler, more direct, more violent, more effective and more invincible. Even if you have that robes on your body, it can still be fatal if you hit the body once. And this combination of power and ** makes every movement of the human body reach the limit that the human body can reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa slowly took a half-squatting right foot with a starting motion and left the left hand slightly. He pressed the handle on the back with the right hand on the ground. Every muscle in his body accumulates strength and then tightens as soon as he touches it. His eyes looked at the ground and all his spirits and attention were placed on the opponent in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hit. All opportunities are only one hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really experienced the threat of death. The original fighting spirit and killing in the deepest part of Asa’s heart began to permeate. It seems that there has always been a beast sleeping. The touch will be awakened and then begin to gallop wildly in the body. The clarity of meditation still shrouds the combination of thinking and the awakening of the original ** into a cold but still burning fighting spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the front of the opponent like a leopard, Gru's original expression like a sculptural expression has a little fluctuation. His thin lips stretched a little to the side and then bent slightly upwards. This smile made him look energized. His whole body began to have white light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as a move. The air in the room seems to have solidified the dampness of the sea surface before the storm. The owner of Cedros, who stood by the door, slowly withdrew from the stone house. He didn't want to intervene and believed that he didn't need to intervene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only two people breathing in the room to catch up with each other in a strange rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Asa’s inspiratory peak catches up with Gru’s breathlessness, he suddenly violently accumulates all the power for a long time from this leaping action. The smashing out of the leopard and smashing out the muscles of the waist muscles all the way to the back of the wrist. The knife turned into a black electric light and thundered and smashed toward the front of Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame in Gru’s eyes became weaker and weaker, as if he had lost enough fuel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can see that the strength and degree of this knife is very good but it also feels very boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power and body movements of the surgeon are impeccable, but there is no slightest spirit and fighting spirit in it. It is simply using strength. This is not the kind of attack in life and death that condenses life and soul. It is just a different action than cutting wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru feels very disappointed. He was very excited when he first saw this opponent’s reaction and action like a beast. He thought it would be a very enjoyable fight. . He stretched out his right hand and grabbed the blade like a walking hand to grab the leaves hanging down in front of him. The left hand gripped into a fist and scorned and disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he immediately has a right hand and is very light on his left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knife feels very light, not just without spirit and fighting spirit, even the power and degree are completely gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knife is light because the person holding the knife has not held the knife at all, and the hand has been let go when the knife is about to be caught. All the power is kept to withstand the punch that comes from the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand just reached the fist but even if all the forces that had been prepared before did not weaken the fist, the caster was hit with it. The shape of the chest and the chest are recessed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sound of broken bones. The whole room was filled with the roar of airflow and magical power. A huge and weird wild fireball instantly spurred the huge airflow towards the close door of Gru, which was close to the door. This is the real fatal blow that condenses all power and spirit. Even the appearance of the fireball is like an angry beast because of the high concentration and alienation of mental power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reflecting the light in front of this, Gru's pupils have become the golden color of this jump. He can even see the magical power of the wild spells in this low-level spell that can blow a bronze statue into a red-hot debris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fireball is a very simple fire attack spell that every wizard will use. But it is because of the simplicity that the magic power of the caster can be condensed in an instant to be used under such close-up tearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely can't hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa uses at least half of the magic power to speed up the fireball. This is a good time to take a good start or a good time to create it with your own hand and serious injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen this opponent's degree no matter how far away the speed of the spell is not necessarily grasped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Create opportunities without the opportunity. Only when the other party first attacks and waits for the opponent to attack and cannot dodge, there is a chance for a moment. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But such an opponent is almost absolutely sure that he will be able to defend his robes by killing him. . So he used all his strength and one hand to defend and then use magic to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diameter of the fireball is half the size. It was only after the formation that it almost reached the body of Gru and flew out faster than the arrow. The distance between the two is only two steps. Absolutely no one can hide from Asa with such a close distance and be confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it absolutely impossible to hide? At least Gru does not reveal a point to hide. The white light that he let go of the knife was so strong that it seemed to have a shape. This hand was in front of the fireball with the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fireball is not a real ball. It is a natural shape produced by a high-magic force. It only has a slight touch on things that affect the balance of magical power. It will explode immediately. But now the fireball is like a real ball. The white hand of Gru is blocking the flame at the edge of the fireball. It is fluctuating repeatedly. I want to leave this and continue to fly forward but I can’t cross that layer. The light of white. Just like the most violent beast of hell, the god of war, Ares, can't do anything like holding his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just an instant stagnation of Gru’s hand. A wave of fireballs completely changes the direction toward the roof and continues to fly with the original wildness. After a slam, the entire roof made of thick wood structure did not leave the ground and made countless pieces of flames rushed into the air. Almost all of the city of Oufu was illuminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru’s right hand still remains in that swaying position. It’s not so easy to turn a group of rolling magic powers in the same direction. Things are at least a few times more difficult than releasing this magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So his hand has not been retracted to put this magical hand has been pressed against his face and the palm of the hand began to flash a fireball. This time it is no longer shot, but it is necessary to press the fireball on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a pre-prepared tactic. In terms of human physique, the flow of magical power cannot be as fast as magic in such a short period of time. The formation of a fireball is much smaller and slower than it was just now. This is another attack that the opponent immediately took after the blow failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using one's own hand and the danger of direct death in exchange for a most effective attack opportunity. In the face of all the blows, there was no slightest discouragement, but instead of another attack, this fight was more than the most violent warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the real fighter. Gru gave a low voice: "Okay." The fist that had been shot was already taken back. He grabbed the hand on the head and reached out and grabbed each other like a high-five high-five. The fireball that was too late to be formed was suddenly squeezed by the layer of white on his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
