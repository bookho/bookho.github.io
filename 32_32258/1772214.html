			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the occasion of the unimpeded movement of the coalition forces on the wild land, the news of the large forces of Erasia immediately turned and flew back to the kingdom. Hurry. Because Tatalia, located in Elazia, suddenly attacked the coalition forces half a month ago. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the process of the replacement of the Tately throne in the coalition’s mental preparation for the war against the people of Tatalia is still secret, but still Some Xu Fengsheng leaked out. Anyone can think of the intention of Oufu's move. It is not surprising that this war Taitalia will come to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But everyone thought that the battle with the barbarians was on the wild high ground as an irrelevant reinforcement of the Europeans. But now they actually forced the 40,000 troops of Elazia to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tatalia is actually vast and Erasia seems to be but most of them are uninhabited swamps and the prosperity and prosperity of the mountains are naturally thousands of miles away. So the barbarians have been beating for a few years and the battle of Elazia has been a battered blow. Five years ago, a big battle made it even more damaging. If there is not a large swamp as a natural barrier, Erasia is also not interested in the barren land of the north. Maybe Tatalia has long since disappeared. In the past few years, Tatalia has had no action except for some harassment and friction. Although there is news that Oufu has helped the new king of Tatalia to join the throne, the last two countries have formed an alliance but have always been overwhelming to Tatalia. The advantage of sex makes the military of Erasia disapprove of it. Whether it is equipment or tactics, the knights and soldiers who are training on the battlefield are indeed much more effective on the battlefield than they are always screaming at the barbarians. Moreover, the number of barbarians is not too large, even if they are out. There are more orcs of blessings. The troops that remain on the northern border of the country can definitely resist their raids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is absolutely absolutely what Elazia thinks. The fighting power of Tatalia is completely out of the way of Elasi. Not only is almost everyone coming out of the nest, but their equipment is already good enough to rival the regular swordsmen of Erasia. Steel tomahawks and warhammers smashed swordsmen's shields and armor have been easy and they have already had a cane and leather armor that can resist the arrows. These equipments are never made by the barbarians themselves. The source is naturally self-evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the dragons and lizards are also joined by the tamer, they have also joined the battlefield to fully compensate for the weakness of the barbarians and the tactical weakness. These swamp animals have also appeared in the previous Tatalia forces. The number of hundreds of them is only a little help for the battle. But the dragon flies that are now on the battlefield can already be used to describe the biggest ones. The crocodile-sized swamp lizard also began to attack hundreds of enemies under the drive of the animal trainer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that there is news that even the king of Taitalia’s King Taize has come to the forefront. The king who has not been in place for a long time is not just to make the barbarians more morale. High and more efficient command and dominance let their wild morale only play in the role of the place. The barbarians’ way of fighting is no longer screaming like a mad cow. They become more disciplined and tactical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the barbarian has achieved amazing results under combat. After the absolute main force was sent to the wild land, Erasia originally thought that the defensive front of the impregnable gang was easily broken. These barbarians who seized the good opportunity for the first time rushed so deep into the rich plains of Elazia. They naturally would not waste such opportunities. They all looted and pointed to the kingdom of Elazia. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timing of this offense is just right. It was the time when the army of Erasia entered the abdomen of the highlands. In fact, they are closer to the eastern border of Tatalia at this time. But they have to fight back. No one has the courage to take risks to attack the tricks that will be saved or to say that the barbaric talent is the real attack. The barbarians may be able to give up their own rudimentary nests, but the knights can never abandon the royal palace and queen of Erasia. regardless of. Although there were more than 10,000 light-riding troops of Erasia in the cavalry guarding the grain road, they first retraced in the first time. But according to the combat power of the barbarians. This 10,000-cavalry is not the only way to turn around, but also to delay the situation and fight for the retracement of the army on the high ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the absolute main force in the coalition forces, the strength of the four-year army of Erasi to withdraw the coalition forces will undoubtedly be greatly discounted. But this does not mean that they are not enough reasons. Their morale is still high. The first force of the coalition forces has been less than a hundred miles away from the city of Oufu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 10,000-strong army of the Principality of Judah is the most advanced force in the coalition forces. They are directly toward Oufu in a much faster way than other coalition forces. This is the second frontal attack on Oufu. The orcs have already avoided it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, in addition to using the two-legged flying dragon with the brakes to occupy a little advantage in the air, Oufu is still the world of coalition forces. It is true that the former generals of the Jawi warriors are said to be unbelievable and can even say that they are the best military commanders of the Big Six. Especially after the sneak attack on the back had to divide the 30,000 cavalry to guard the grain road, the generals realized that Oufu really was not so good. The characteristics of the orcs can be combined with the appropriate tactics to make a surprising amount of power, as long as the imaginative generals can feel this. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Knights also said to the generals about the sneak attack tactics that Oufu might take after the withdrawal. After that, the generals did not care so carefully. . But basically it has done everything. Not only are the lions no longer arbitrarily attacking the night's garrison, but many of the troops have to be on standby at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This defensive strategy does have a very good effect. High-altitude attempts to sprinkle the dead spirits and sneak attackers appeared on the top of the coalition forces. The distances that were combined by these mages were shot down by lightning. If he used the transfer reel in the air, he would be lived by several magicians even if he was not in midair. Electrocuted. Falling into the army is also a dead end. In the half month after the sneak attack, Oufu has no more action. Perhaps Oufu also noticed that the chance of sneak attack is too small to be worth the risk. After all, it’s not a matter of trying to stay away from the base. An easy thing to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relative coalition forces have not yet learned about the situation of combat and combat effectiveness. Although the commanders can imagine and guess, but then accurate imagination and guessing can not be used as evidence to set up the battle plan, this allowed Judah's reloaded Knights to advanced temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Judah Reloading Knights is actually the strongest unit in the coalition. Both the power and the combat power are enough to match the orcs. Let such a force that should be the main force to test this is the full attention of the coalition forces to Oufu. In this way, even if they are at a disadvantage in the battle with the orcs, they have enough temporary withdrawal to wait for the arrival of the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at least in the heart of the reloading knights in Judah, there is absolutely no such concept of withdrawal. They have such confidence and confidence in this kind of money. The Principality of Judah, like Erasia, is also bordered by Nigan, but the land area and the extent of its wealth are far from Erasia. But although the national strength is not as good as Erasia's strategy in the Nike dungeon, it has never fallen behind. Even the Minotaurs, which are taller and stronger than the Ogre, are unstoppable under the charge of the Judas heavy cavalry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the tens of miles from the European Union, the leader of the coalition saw the troops of Oufu. It’s no longer the ones that only wandered around the edge of their line of sight every day. It is the real army. The scouts who waited for the wait-and-see were able to clearly see the werewolves and ogres after the addition of Advanced Hawkeye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of Judah did not feel the accident. It’s no use for harassment and tactics that are less than a hundred miles away from Oufu. The orcs are only forced to face the battle anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The whole army is preparing to charge." The heads of the Knights gathered together to play against the team. The reloading knight is the most suitable for heavy cavalry in the wasteland of the two horses in the distance between the two armies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the scout who was responsible for watching the reconnaissance shouted at this time: "Oufu first started to charge... No. It’s just one..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it doesn't mean that all the knights can see a small white spot that is getting out of the orc's battle and approaching it quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This white spotlight will soon be seen by the knights who will soon see that this is actually a person who is wrapped in bright white light. With an arrow-like degree, with the momentum of thousands of horses and horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called assault in general, the strength of the two sides will not be too big, at least to occupy the advantage of the arms will take the initiative to attack each other. If it is just a person who is rushing to thousands of heavy cavalry, it is impossible to use the charge to describe the use of death or madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the eyes of all the cavalry who saw this person did not coincide, and the word 'acquisition' emerged at the same time. Even if it is just a person who is facing thousands of the 6 most elite heavy cavalry, it is still the most powerful and most exemplary as the charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bow shot." The head of the Knights, Shen Sheng, threw a few words. He looked at the white silhouette of the flying close to the eyes, there was a fire burning, but the sound and expression were as cool as ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not necessary for him to say that almost all the knights have taken out the military heavyweights and held them in their hands. The Judas knights are all elites who have experienced life and death on the battlefield. Although the mind has fluctuated because of this person, the steel-like will of the military has not wavered. A slap in the face of the innumerable bows rushed toward the oncoming figure. The military's heavy scorpion is enough to penetrate the armor within a hundred steps, and the special bow rider in the team can even wear a shield that is almost worn. Thousands of arrows that were shot from different directions were like a piece of metal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the strong storm is not likely to blow the mountains. This piece of arrow, which is almost densely obscuring the line of sight, seems to be just a piece of paper that was thrown out by the hand in front of the light that was thrown by the hand. The white light and the momentum of his body are not touched by the body. Blow off. Breaking and smashing slanted and scattered and rebounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little slower than the arrow is magic. The latter is responsible for the same level of magical skills in the army. The fireball fire wall, ice and arrow lightning, dozens of magic also all shot toward this person. But these magics that could have made the soldiers smashed into bones now seem to have all become fireworks. They only flashed in front of them, and they still have a lot of magical power that they haven't had time to blast out. It was crushed by the white light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can see the footsteps of this rushing person. But no one wouldn't feel that every step of his step that he couldn't tell stepped on in the center of the earth's crust and stepped on his own heart to make every nerve of his nerves fight with this land. Frightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground is shaking the heart and moving the soul is shaking because he is charging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Out of the gun. Holding the shield." At the same time as the order was issued, the three heads had gathered together and they all looked at the person closer and closer. Everyone took the muscles and veins of their own weapons and the veins that had stretched to the limit were revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the order. The rifles of all the reloading knights in the front row were all erected, and it was a forest of guns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this person still has no stop to face the forest of the steel gun and the fortress built by the steel knight behind him. fierce. A loud bang sounded like a meteorite from the sky hitting the ground. This person actually slammed into the queue of the four thousand heavy Knights with his own flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rifle is broken. The flying knight and the mount together broke the flying shield and the armor broke and mixed with the limbs and the body to fly in the air. The steel knights who could have been invincible on the battlefield smashed like this, smashing like the spurred sand under the violent impact from the place where the man rushed into the queue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The queue of the knights is originally an unbreakable fortress that can defeat the weapon of tens of thousands of infantry, but the shadow surrounded by white light is like a stroke. A black lake surface has stirred up countless splashes and continues to spurt during the period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the companions’ bodies and weapons are scattered like rain, all the reloading knights are not flustered and the two-winged knights are constantly circling toward the middle. The formation of the knights is constantly changing like a giant monster transforming the body to surround the foreign body that has broken into his body as much as possible. And as more and more knights were knocked down, the man began to slow down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A muffled sound like a rock hitting the center of the lake finally stopped. The road behind him that had just been knocked out by himself was filled in by the surrounding knights in an instant. He was already in the middle of the thousands of knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General Gru has long been famous." The dull voice came out of the mask and the three heads of the Knights of Judah shouldered shoulder-to-shoulder In the hands of this person or the combination of the three heads of the team, the attack finally stopped the person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The legendary Oufu's orc army's god of war is really worthy of the name. I am afraid that the Paladin Lancelot is not likely to break into our camp. Your full-service shock actually defeated our hundreds of elite knights in one breath."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we really don't think you will take such stupid tactics Do you think that with your own strength, you can use our team to reinvent the morale of our army? You are too small to look at us. Now that your momentum is exhausted, you are still unable to rush out of our hands. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
