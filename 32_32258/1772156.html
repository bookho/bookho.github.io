			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of Xi Lika’s shot just now is not small enough for the two people who have not shot before. The two men are middle-aged people who are obsessed with some fatness. One is the only young man in eight who asks for gold coins from Helicika. If the middle-aged man sighed with a sigh, he took out a weird helmet and took it on the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man’s helmet is a lifelike wolf head. It looks like a wolf’s head that has just been cut down. Even the eyes are flashing green. Rays. The middle-aged man put on the wolf's head helmet and whispered the curse. The whole body began to tremble slightly. In the trembling, the body was gradually deformed and gradually became tall. The majestic bones also groaned and the strange skin was barely exposed outside the clothes. Long hair. In a twinkling of an eye, he turned from a fat middle-aged man to a wolf who was almost as tall as Helicika. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Druid?" All but the Helicika were surprised. This magical group has long been annihilated on the Big 6 for more than a hundred years. These are as close to the elves as nature. The human beings who worship the god of nature have their own magic system. The most magical one is that it can be changed into various animals. But these natural believers are different from the elves who are far from the world. They spare no effort to persuade others to join their organization to prevent anyone from destroying forests and nature or even using force, whether it is deforestation or mining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No such governor would like it for such extreme activities and beliefs, and the church sees it as a thorn in the eye. After years of arrest and rejection of the Qing Dynasty, this group has almost disappeared on the Big 6. I can't imagine that I can still get one in the basement where this bandit is accumulating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural knight naturally saw this man’s change of surprise and she suddenly fell down on one knee and slammed her sword on her forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people, including Helicika, are stunned. In this atmosphere of arrogance and arrogance. This nervous focus person actually has such a move. There were a few over-exposed thieves who quickly covered their heads and thought that this was a weird gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for not only letting me go here to kill these evil people, but also to let me see the pagans who have missed the net here. Let me use these devil believers. Blood to wash my sword and soul to add the light of the Lord's glory." The voice and expression of the female knight are sincere and serious. Just like praying in a church. In front of more than one hundred of Erasia's most fierce bandits, a casual name can be used as a murderer to scare children. In her eyes, there is no need to be even more alert than a group of mice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thieves naturally felt that the knight’s scorn was so good that the contempt behind it was only a pity, but the courage to open the mouth was too much. The faces of the three men who had just returned from the injury were even more difficult. The druid green oil that just changed into a werewolf flashed the flashing mouth and the fangs slightly revealed the low snoring in the throat exactly like the real werewolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man standing next to Helikka suddenly sighed. Turning around, Helicel nodded slightly and said, "This woman is stupid but it is not very good. You should not hide it with everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika also nodded and the two men walked together to the horsewoman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika is holding a rifle thrown by the horsewoman. The ordinary knight in his hands can only flatten the pure steel gun in his hand like a toy, light and single-handedly shake the gun and fly. Actually, he is more sophisticated than the regular knight. With the pace of every step of his huge body, the basement shook a little. Every stone that fell on the ground with the footsteps collapsed with the split. Not only because of his bear-like weight, but because of the power of the whole body. He went to the horsewoman step by step. Like a moving mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man next to him walked silently until he pulled out the knife behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squeaky squeak of the knife was filled with the entire space and the dark red blood shadow appeared as if there was life. The sound and the flowing color are faintly smouldering. This breath is not something that people can smell but penetrate into the bone marrow and the body to feel from the bottom of my heart. All the gangsters who were watching were all embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stable and mighty, a combination of Xiao and Xiao, the momentum of the two people is enough to capture the people. However, there was no fear of the female knight's face. She looked at the two of her eyes. All of them were condescending. When they saw the knife in the man's hand, the flashing dark red light and shadow, though moving, but after the surprise, they rushed to the face. It’s all angry, she looks at the loud voice: “The dark servant, you dare to use such evil weapons in front of the messengers of God, you will mourn and mourn on the stakes for this.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female phoenix's phoenix eye suddenly screamed like a white lightning rushing out of the sword and slashing. The sound of the "When" screaming sword echoed in the basement and all the thieves caught their ears. This is the first person to fully mount the horsewoman's blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pictures are divided. Although it blocked the Lei Jian’s wrathful sword, the man was also taken back by a footstep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen kinds of white magic is enough to kill a cat even if it is added to a mouse. Moreover, the Knights of the Temple will never leave the mouse. This white magic has made her an overwhelming advantage even in her simple physical strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the time of the man’s squatting is that the figure of the female knight is stumbling and slamming and retreating is not easy to stop again. The look of an angry face couldn't help but lightly coughed and his face glowed with a pale mouth and a bloodshot. There is a big dent in the chest armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika’s eyes were full of wine glasses for the first time, showing a horrifying look. He looked at the stainless steel knight gun in his hand and it was already distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accepting his power, even if it is an ordinary wooden stick, it is enough to pierce a rhinoceros. What's more, this gun is a shot that he prepared when he spoke from a man. But he couldn't think of the result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She is a brilliant fighter to give her a chance to breathe." The man who had just been repulsed rushed to the horsewoman. Druid, who turned into a werewolf, also screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glorious Battle Armor. Even the Holy See, where the magical equipment and objects are called the Big Six, is regarded as a treasure. For two or three hundred years, the church has only created a few pieces. In addition to the materials used in the precious forging craftsmanship is the most difficult for the human and dwarf masters blacksmith or his method of enchanting. That must be done with the magical power of a top-level Master. In general, the cardinal who is about to die at the end of his life will transform his life's bright magic into the magic of this armor. Such a battle armor is seen as a proof of the church's brilliant faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the man screamed, the knight’s hand had already touched the dent on the armor. The radiance of the restored magic flashed her pale face and immediately turned to the dent on the bloody armor and even gradually recovered. Everyone who saw this scene was full of changes, green, red, and more pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika cursed and threw down the rifle that had become a twist, grabbed the hands of the thin man’s hand and rushed to the sword. Such as Ray is almost better than the thin man. But he just waved two swords and took the next sword. He immediately yelled at the thunderous sound with a clear anxiety and anger. The clods on the top also fell: "Who has a way to put this on the body?" The magic is lifted. Did you hear Aisisi?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard. But I really can't help it." Aisi is really crying. Out. He hasn't had a break in the back, just a small spell like the slow-moving dispelling technique, which has consumed his magic and can only be anxious behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werewolf Druid and the black woman and the man who used the sword at the same time added to the battle group. The five-person weapon was rolled into a tornado that trapped the female knight firmly in the sound of the collision and hitting the armor. But the female knight is not struggling to deal with it. Apart from the knife that snarls the dark red light and shadow, there are still scruples that dare not let the man directly hit her other weapons. Even the one-handed giant sword that Helicia wielded sometimes did not deliberately evade the homeopathic turn and borrowed the force to let the sword slide over the armor. And her long sword was able to keep the other people in a hurry while protecting the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knight Rider is not only taking the glorious armor. The scream of Hilika has already explained the problem. No matter how strong the power is, there is a reaction. The Knights of the Temple, who are responsible for more than a dozen kinds of white magic, are far above the crowd, not to mention the sharp swordsmanship. And the 80% of the female knight's offensive hit the other man in the knife, this can barely blend in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When. The sound of a long, long weapon intersected the horsewoman's long sword and the dark red knife quickly and slashed dozens of times. The man once again slammed back and almost even the knife was not stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clear and screaming shouting female knight twists and turns the long sword into a silver light curtain. Hilika and the other three were all forced to retreat. Druid's hand was slightly slower. A little three fingers were caught in the sword and smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
