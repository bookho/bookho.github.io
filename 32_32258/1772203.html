			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should I escape? I don’t know how long it took to run. Asa suddenly had such a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem seems to be a thundering thunder of the night, bringing a sense of light and lucidity to the original chaos, and then his own thinking is unconsciously It’s back. Although it still feels like the fascination of being slammed in the back of the head with a big stick of hard fruit wine after drinking ten pounds of fruit wine, it is just a confused and chaotic chaos that is completely unthinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic and fighting spirit are indeed gradually recovering, but this sudden sobriety has nothing to do with this. Asa can feel that the chaotic power in the brain that is in a mess and crowded and mixed, seems to be slowly weakening the lingering mind that gradually dissipates into the surrounding. His mind gradually began to vacate the space of thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a little bit of thinking, he immediately became aware of it. Escape is just a reaction to instinct in his mind but this is not necessarily the best or even the worst. It seems that it is the easiest to be seen in a street in such a dark city where there is almost no invisible rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the rain was as big as it was filled with heaven and earth, but Asa immediately identified an unusually fast footstep that was coming here. It was because of the support of meditation that he did not really go mad, but now the self-thinking resumed. Because of meditation, the senses were extremely sharp and the senses immediately felt abnormal. A heavy and quick. The humming sound of the metal and the road surface gradually approached through the loud rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It feels like it’s just that his mind is still vague, although it’s already much better than it was at the beginning. But that only changed from a solidified paste to a pile of flowable paste. Although the magical power and the vindictiveness have recovered a little, it is really only a small one. Needless to say, even the Knights Templar is more combative than him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pace of the horsewoman has reached a corner of the corner not far behind. Maybe you just need a radiant armor that turns around with white light to appear in sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis is too big to run the rain. She has to run and block her eyes with one hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no other search for the church guards and pastors Wang Cheng along the way. It’s really not too bad, it’s too bad, even if it’s loud, it’s hard to pass. Outside the meter. A few miles away from the horror, she rushed over and she dared not spend any more time looking for a comrade to accompany her. Others should still search everywhere in the storm, only she is the furthest away. A senior pastor gave her an eagle eye and a darker sight. There is also a higher level of insight. If it is a large group of people, it will hinder her perception. Follow what you saw at the top of the church. The man’s footsteps ran upside down. It seems that it is a bad injury. Now this is a perfect opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just turned around this corner of Talis, the pace suddenly slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an alley between several tall buildings that are common in the city. It is now dark and dead. Only the wind and rain hit the floor and the roof is dull but monotonous. Huge voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Talis slowly came down was that she seemed to hear a voice. A slight sound that is almost inaudible in this huge wind and rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not footsteps. The street is a well-built curved stone road. The big wind and rain does not have water. There are countless raindrops on it. As long as it is not her kind of steel knight boots, there will be no obvious sound. So what Talis heard was not footsteps but the sound of rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are all rains on the slate floor and the sound on the roof. Only in the darkness not far from the side, there should be a rain in the rain but no rain. The place where the sound of the ground was hit and the group was still moving towards her in a swift and unrestrained manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s impossible that any animal in the animal kingdom will not be active in such a rainy night, even the brilliance of the brilliance of the animal’s darkness will They avoid it. This is undoubtedly the person hidden in the dark and seems to be a person who wants to attack her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for death." Talis sighed and screamed at the sword on her back with white magic and vindictive savage smashing the rain curtain. The momentum and pressure of the sword on the sword did not open the front wind and rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Talis asked loudly. Although she still didn't see the person's appearance, she had already figured out that this person is not the target she is looking for. Not only is there a difference in the shape of the clothing to block her sword, but also the sword and the feeling of striking from the two swords, she can feel that this is also a master with a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's me." The man whispered to the faint vindictive light that reflected a sallow face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it you? What are you doing here?" Talis recognized that he was General Oling of the Knights of the Kingdom of Elazia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I heard the bells in the cathedral to help." General Oling lightly coughed a few times in the rain and was drenched. The sick face looks a bit bitter. The color of his vindictiveness is a sick yellow with the same color as his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only you alone? What are you doing?" Talis asked sharply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Ou Ling faintly replied: "In such a situation, it is best to hide a killer who is good at hiding the trail. Otherwise, like Talis. The whole body shining with the radiance of holy white magic can certainly drive out the darkness and filth evil. Maybe it will also scare away the person who wants to catch it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey. I don't have time to crap with you guys." Talis turned her head and was about to walk away and suddenly remembered turning her head and looking at General O'Ling. "How do you know that I am chasing a killer? I should be the one who chased the farthest. You should have not encountered other searchers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "St. Peter's Cathedral bells for the first time in the past few decades. It is naturally a big deal. In the past two days, three military aircraft officers have been assassinated. Although I don't want to imagine this, it seems that only the assassin. It’s a mess... is it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis snorted. As an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it really because the Bishop of Ascher was killed? How can this be..." General Ou Ling was surprised and sorrowful but probably Because of his sorrow and lack of energy, this expression seems to be somewhat weird and it seems to be made deliberately. "There are so many elite knights in the Megatron 6 that there are so many elite guards, the Eschael Bishop's bright magic is even more fascinating. How can this be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Do not talk nonsense or help find it or go back." Talis screamed at General Ouling and turned and walked away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please wait...Talis, the great man..." General O'ling called Talis. However, it seems that due to this situation, I talked into the rain. He coughed fiercely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Talis turned and turned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Ou Ling coughed for a while. Then he straightened up and asked weakly: "How do you come here alone, Talis!" Guards and other people? This assassin can even be able to deal with the assassination of the esthetic adult, can you deal with it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis is briefly silent a bit. But her silence is not nothing to say. But I dare not say that she is afraid that when she opens her mouth, she will be out of control and go up to stab a sick man who seems to have endless nonsense. But after all, she still resisted. In any case, this person is still an ally. She replied in one breath: "I have now that the guy should have escaped to the vicinity and can't summon the man. He seems to have suffered a minor injury, although the appearance of the scar may have been hurt by the mental magic of the Bishop of Leschard. If you catch this murderer, Leicester will thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Ou Ling nodded and coughed twice and said: "赛Lester’s thanks to me, Wufu is not eager to hope. But I will try my best.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“That’s good.” Talis coldly I should turn around and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait for Talis, you don't leave." General O'ling again shouted, but this time Talis did not really get out of control because of these That is what she wants to hear now. "Actually, I am also caught up in the trace of the assassin. I can even be sure that he is... just..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking at key places General Ou Ling suddenly coughed a few times and the voice was small. It was just a thunder that covered his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
