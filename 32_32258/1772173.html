			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After walking in the trees for a long time, it is approaching the demon enchantment marked on the map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Axis, one of the functions of the enchantment is to reflect the intruders in the forest to the elves and the most important one is to automatically block any Close to the people living in the elves. However, the enchantment is how to stop the use of methods to stop him but did not say that he probably did not try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think it's always a bit wrong." Bill's old man looked nervously as if he was a mouse that felt like he was being peeped by a cat. From the time he walked into the forest, he began to pay attention to the fact that he was more and more suspicious. But he also did not have the courage to turn back alone. Although the time is short, the temper of Helicika has been deeply imprinted in everyone's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fuck. You have said this ninety-nine times. I swear to hear you say that I will tear down your old bones." Hilton slammed the old man's face with the blue veins and the fierce light in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I bet I will burst out of your brain before you start..." The old man, who was so wretched as a mouse, suddenly became fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗噜噜. A large harpsichord slammed from the branches and glared at the same time as Hilton and the old avatar and two rabbits jumped together. Others were also shocked to varying degrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time this has happened. Everywhere in the forest, there will be a variety of animals flashing from time to time. Everyone's psychology is extremely tense. Although no individual here is not the kind of newcomer who entered the battlefield, but the mental pressure to maintain this tense mentality has accumulated after half a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walk in the life and death line all the year round and their hearts are extremely sensitive to danger and abnormal breath. Although I can't find anything strange when I look closely, the weird feeling that overflows in the air is indeed like what Bill's old man said is always somewhere to peep at them. For a long time, under such a high-spirited height, Hilton and Bill's old man are obviously close to the psychological limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be nervous." The man named Sandefes spoke up. He is the leader of this group and the only one who seems to be still calm. His face is still a deadly expression. But the sound is very flat and easygoing. He swept a few other people and said, "Are you afraid of death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is not afraid of death?" Hilton angrily inserted the boxing sword that had just been pulled out. go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you can rest assured that you will not die if you listen to me." The man faintly said something strange. In fact, this is not surprising. But in his plain tone, it seems to hide something... I haven’t waited for other people to react and he said something more strange: “We’re all better than chatting.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chat?" The rest of the people stayed. This situation does not seem to be a good environment for chatting. It’s just that strange instinct that makes them a bit hysterical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man suddenly stopped and turned to look at the people and said, "I’ll understand it. I may have a lot of big deals in the future. I can't afford it. If you like, you can follow me later. You have any hopes and requirements to talk about. I also want to hear your background."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Hilton Druid Bills are all face to face. Even the black woman Jessica, who has been following the man, looked at him with a strange look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, boss, you can afford it." Hilton hesitated. "But after doing this, everyone here should be able to take the mountain and enjoy it for the rest of the life. So now we still concentrate on doing this now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I tell you that this vote is absolutely hopeless." Men and women said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" "How come?" "What do you mean?" The Hilton three were shocked. The surprise in Jessica’s eyes also shows that she does not know the reason for this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man said faintly: "There are tens of thousands of elves in the forests of Tula, and there are hundreds of magicians. There are hundreds of unicorns." Do you think that with the 400 thieves and a few of us, I really want to occupy this city where the elves have been in business for hundreds of years?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now I said no. Do you believe that he still believes in me?" The man did not argue that he was looking at a few companions straight away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the weird silence Bill’s old man sighed and said, “I believe my life is only once.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "But... they didn't swear that they were investigating. Is there really only a few hundred people there?" Hilton didn't give up. The reward for this action did have the urge to take risks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I asked you the last time you believed him or did you believe me?" The man's dead face and a dull voice. Plus his strength seems to be quite a daunting idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I think it should be like this." Druid nodded. He has always been quietly following the old solid wood in the team, and it seems that he is following the followers of several other people. "The elves have been here for hundreds of years, and even when the kingdom of Erassia established its expansion, they did not hit their ideas. The life of the elves is really unreasonable. As Hilika said, the population has faded in these hundreds of years." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this, Hilton will no longer refute it. Once it is true, this group of eight invaders is completely dead. One hundred elf magicians are definitely a horrible concept. The lifespan of elves determines that they will not be rookies on magical rumors. Although it is said that because of their beliefs and civilizations, few people specialize in the advanced elemental magic of attacking, but the hundreds of magicians are not hundreds of cabbages. There are also tens of thousands of archers who can serve as instructors in the human army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; want to deal with this battle. Unless there is a legendary curse scroll in the three reels of Aisisi. However, the entire curse of the curse reel is not too much. The three books are almost the same as the dragon. If Axis can have such a baby on his hand, he can't use a thief. And with the level of the senior magician in his area, he probably hasn't been able to use this kind of magical treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man seems to be arguing that these are not enough to continue: "Nigan has also crossed the Tula de Angling forest and went straight to Elazia but could not pass the elf. It’s just that the elves are so flamboyant that these battles are not well known. Do you think they set up such a huge magical enchantment just to guard against humans?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "How do you know... these?" Bill's old man wrinkled a pair of eyes and stared at the man. "And since you know how to join our team?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I know that you don't need to know for a while." The man's slight smile Did not smile. It is strange and mysterious in the eyes of others. "If you have doubts about me, continue to go inside and see for yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since that is how we have to go in and die "What?" Hilton was anxious and angry and pumped a sword. He seemed to be looking for someone to take two knives. But now no one here dares to go. Then I waved it up. "Fuck. I don't do it fucking. Why don't you say it earlier? Is it fun to say it at this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man said faintly: "So I I just told you just to follow me and believe that my reward should not disappoint you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The others are silent. Swords and slams here, but inexplicably heard such a message so that their nerves are close to the mind and can not react. Only Druid Anderson asked: "What do you want us to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man said: "Since we are not the opponents of the elves, then turn around and help them to deal with those thieves. Not on the line? And... maybe there are other enemies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? This is too unfair." Hilton touched his head. Individuals are also embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I agree. I will help you." Anderson almost agreed to blurt out. "As long as you can help me to ask the elves for a few things I need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hilton thought and had to nod. Although his mind is not very good. But after mixing for so many years, he is still very able to distinguish the situation. The man has already stated himself to show that he is standing on the side of the elf. Although I don't understand how such a person would have anything to do with the elves, in this case, I don't want to join and directly ask the other party to kill the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill’s old man thought about it and he nodded his head and said, “Well, this is the best way to win the game. You don’t have to be a hedgehog and you don’t have to go back empty-handed.” The appearance of this old-fashioned mouse is not a natural appearance. What's more, if you really follow such a person with real strength, there may be a lot of benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
