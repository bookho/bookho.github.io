			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Later, Akibad sent me back to Nigan with this seal. Unfortunately, this blood was sealed with the ancient elf secret law and the dark star. I can't break the Zhulian. The only way is to use the brand of the dark star in the body like Akibad, and to fully accept the life of the people of the black star to continuously reduce the power of the seal." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Qingming Gaoyuan, the world is not contention. This is Akibad's message to the Necromancer. Those who can enter the Deya Valley are outstanding among human beings. The best, people who really have such a mentality will not bother to practice the meditation, nor will they pursue anything. They are the best guards of the sword. Each Necromancer is accepting the Dark Star. When you brand, you will feel the breath of the sword. Needless to say, they all understand what it is. But once the heart is covered by desires and other things, it will be attracted by the sword. Such people Can also practice meditation Explain that his soul has completely integrated with those things derived from desires, and can already resonate with the Dark Star, so Akibad has left such a way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Now, you should understand why this road left by Akibad is a way to send people to death. No matter if Akibad or me, I don't want someone to really pull out the dark. Star."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only understand a little." Asa has been listening quietly, now suddenly, he is laughing, half is laughing Half is a bitter smile. "Akibad is still in trouble with his head. If it is something that can't be touched, then all the things are clearly stated, not enough. Leave any damn prophecy, so make all the things happen now." "Black smoke"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You understand a fart, little guy. You have the ability to think and look at your head, and your chest is even more than one of Akibad’s toes. Not on." Morrier's hot, hot breath screamed at Asa, and Asa felt his hair brows bent at the same time. "Don't use your intelligence and values ​​that are almost the same as monkeys to judge the existence of a better than you. That is the place I hate humans the most."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In the era of the Elven Empire, the elves are far from magical breasts and technology, and now you are comparable to human monkeys. Their characteristics of the Blade of Doomsday are much better than that of Akibad, but in the end? Take the sword up. Because the meaning of the sword exists is to let people use it, do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not understand." Asa shook his head . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sword is made up of countless desires, emotions, thoughts, and souls. Desires are not just greed that is directly expressed. It is the pursuit. Whether it is an elf or a person, it will go higher, better, and farther away, and will pursue more things and stronger power. The accumulation of desire will eventually lead to tilt, deterioration, and collapse. This leads to despair, anger, and killing. These are the breaths of this sword.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Being flexible, there will be desires, If you have a desire, you will use this sword with a swarm of bees. This sword is a gathering of death, but it is also one with life itself. Death is not opposed to life, but an inseparable part of life. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The development of living beings is like building blocks getting higher and higher, but no matter how high it will eventually collapse because of its weight and height, the sword is actually A valve that collapses when a stack of wood is raised to a certain extent. Not to make the building blocks too heavy and too heavy to be irreparable, can give the next pile of wood to accumulate space... The Elf Empire seems to have a more distant culture before, then the Elf Empire, and then now you human The world, maybe there are other races that will rise in the future... The Dark Star is both devastating, but it brings out new life. This is the truth of this world cycle, do you understand? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still don't understand. "Asa still shakes her head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unexpectedly, little monkey. Moriel didn't look surprised. Longkou screamed and seemed to be sneer, but the hot air spewed Asa's skin and it hurt. "I didn't even understand it five hundred years ago. This is Aki." Bud said to me... Hey, I have to admit that although he is a personal class, he also has a place to be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just that he It’s just an individual. Even if you see these reasons, there is still no way to completely detach yourself as a person. Ming knows that it is futile, knowing that the day will come sooner or later, still can't help but think about this trick to delay. Ming knows that if I destroy the sword, at least before the sword re-condenses, humans can linger for thousands of years, but still have to stop me for those who are in front of me. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if I can see the distant truths and see the trajectory of all things, I am only a weak human being. It is just a grain of sand in the world and the river of time. Let's be a person and do a good job." What people can do, struggle, go weak, helpless, and finally die like everyone else. This is what I want to do and the only thing I can do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "When I heard that this human being should be the strongest person, but when I said this, I felt for the first time that maybe human beings are not so low." Moriel no longer looked at Asa, but I narrowed my eyes and seemed to be completely immersed in my memories. "It's a nasty guy... If there are other dragons who know, the princess of the arrogant Black Dragon will actually be a little bit tempted by a human being. It's a weird thing..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be a bit clear..." Asa nodded thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Moriel looked at him with some surprise and looked at him for a while. "It seems that it is not nonsense, I really understand something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The one he said...the people who gathered the power will mention the dark star... ...is it the leaf of the world tree like me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like you?" Moriel first glimpsed, then the thunderous laughter from She rushed out of her mouth. "Why, do you think you are very powerful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa opened his mouth but could not speak. Moriel's laughter only shocked his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t make me laugh. The power of Akibad’s mouth, how can it be with the power of the guys in your fly camp shit? In the eyes of the eye, the power can only be used in the fist of the scorpion. It can be used to bomb the magic of the person. The magic wave that rolls in the body is the thickness of the muscle, is it?” Morial shook his head, although the expression on his face could not be Understand, but when you want to come and ridicule humans, you should have the same meaning. "In the eyes of these later people, the level of Akibad is actually like a rogue who only knows how to fight a wolf. Is his eyes on those things? I really feel that it is worthless for him."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know what is the real power of human beings? Telling you is a desire. The human mind and magical talent are not necessarily higher than the elves, and the physical strength is much worse than the orcs. Even lifespan is only a few decades, but it can develop to the present level in a short period of time, because of desire. Going crazy, pursuing, expanding, devouring, pursuing higher and better This is why you can develop this step."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The accumulation of this desire will eventually get out of control. Constantly pursue higher and stronger, Even the things of their own origin are concealed and distorted by the things derived from desire. That is the breath of the sword. These forces gather, concentrate, mix, and then deteriorate, whether it is out of ambition, revenge, despair, Curious or what, in short, Uprooted people to the sword. "Morrill out Talon, pointed Asa. "This is the difference between vision and chest. Akibad is speaking from a human perspective, and you are standing on your own fist to understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You You should be glad that you only hold the hilt before this. Your heart does not match the smell of the sword. The power of the sun well and the leaves of the world tree can protect your body in front of the power of the hilt, but as long as Once in contact with the complete blade, I promise that you will become a dry corpse within three seconds and then fall into pieces of the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aki Bud is indeed much stronger than you, too good, but he is only a personal. After all, what he said is his own speculation, not a metaphor that can determine the direction of the world. It’s just that the weaker guys usually like I need a high-level prophecy to guide myself, so I will misinterpret his words according to my own ideas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The...the world tree leaves and the sun well What is it? I heard about it in the elves. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, that’s just the idea that the sharp-eared guys are self-righteous. When the Elf King was controlled by the Blade of Doom, they consumed all the elves. The mage's energy made a few things with magic to fight against the sword of the end, the world tree leaves and the sun well are two of them. I have to admit that those guys' magic skills are really brilliant, plus the sword of the end The understanding of this, actually made a similar and power of the world tree leaves, but the power of this thing is not comparable to the black star, and they have not had time to use. In the later big catastrophe, a small dial The elf took these things and sighed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
