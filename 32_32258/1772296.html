			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Meimei was surprised by Talis in the side, and the knowledge of the Knights of the Temple was full of knowledge, and knowledge and vision were also necessary for the Cavaliers. One of the things in Celeste's data room is naturally everything, so she mostly recognizes these specimens and souvenirs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than that, she seems to see the extraordinary value of these little things more than Ah, the collections in Celeste are the best, and the senior The complete explanation of the naturalist scholars, so that her resolution even sees many details that Asa does not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This Mei Cunsha's hair has already had red scales, at least a tribal chief... This should be the nail of the Wyvern... These are all difficult things. An adventurer has these collections? I don't think there is any in the collection of the kingdom of Elazia."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hey, come over and see." Talis picked up two things and called Asa over. Her voice has changed from amazement to calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A kind of surprise has reached a certain limit, becoming a calm when shocked and alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the eye of a pretty cow in the savvy swamp. You know." Talis's left hand is a fist-sized eyeball, specially treated. Like a weird toy, the huge pupil on the top reflects the figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Know, it’s still an old-aged eye." Asa nodded. Only the pupils of old cattle will slowly turn black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not just the old cow, it’s the eye of one of the strongest old bulls, which means it should be the eye of a king of bulls. Look The pupils have completely become black, and there are magical fluctuations. This king of bulls is said to be able to use the line of sight to emit a magical effect similar to the spirits. Their eyeballs are also a necessity for the big magic scrolls that make Necromancer. The king is extremely difficult to capture. I remember that there is only one in Celeste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa frowned. He knows that this is indeed the eyeball that has been placed here for more than ten years. It seems that any villager passing by can sneak open the door when the owner is absent. It is really hard to believe that this will be even a church. There is only one rare magic item. But with his current perception, he can also detect the faint magical fluctuations on the eyeball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Save this eyeball is not just a means of anti-corrosion. It must be infused with magical power to ensure that the dead magic is not exhausted. .. needs to be instilled, but also the magic of the dead...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa’s eyes jumped. He heard that these are not nonsense. Talis seems to have no reason to talk nonsense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is this thing. I'm sure it shouldn't be an adventurer." Talis's voice is colder, her right hand. It is a half cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, this... seems to be just a half-normal cane." Asa replied. This is really a half-hand cane.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the wood is very good, the workmanship is very fine, but there is no magic fluctuation or strange smell. He took it in his hands more than once a hour, used to scratch his itch and took him through the nest. . . Familiar with it can no longer be familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I tell you. In the showroom of Celeste, the top half of the cane is placed on the highest altar. This is the last The Pope, Deken’s all the canes.” Talis’s voice shook a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa and Ayi Mei are completely stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will you be a sister, are you wrong?" This is what Ayimei is asking. It is also difficult for her to believe that the former pope's cane can be seen in a small village in a small village without a closed door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This wood is the core of the millennial elf tree, and the pattern on the top and the broken lines are also in line with the first half of the scepter in Celeste. Breaking the crack road. I can't remember correctly, because Magnus is using this click on my forehead. I am awarded the title of Knight of the Temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa smiled and smiled: "Oh, I can't think of what I used to scratch my back when I was a child. This collection of mother-in-law is really..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The greatest ideal of every Knights Templar is to arrest the murderer who had assassinated the last Pope Deken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s face is a little stubborn The smile that was squeezed out was completely cold. He knows that it is unlikely that someone is willing to copy. Also, he now knows why it would be strange to get back here now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing here that has changed, it is your own vision. Before this. Even after spending more than a decade in the cabin, he did not see the extraordinaryness of this seemingly ordinary cabin, or that he had no power and eyesight at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of the house, the size of the house, the direction of the door, the distance between the two cabinets, the location... and everything in the log cabin The location and layout are the most reasonable and most prudent. It allows the owner to react as quickly as possible in any position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should not be deliberate, it’s just an undefended cabin, it’s only how much the master is in the process of setting it up. The habit, like a beast, will never relax his vigilance even when eating or sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you let the current Asa to arrange your own wooden house, it may be similar to this cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I heard that the last Pope Deken was not sick 20 years ago?" Ai Mei asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not a sickness. Deken's squatting one night before the violent night, he once killed three assassins who killed him without magic, even if it was magic. His skill is also enough to be among the top ten in front of the mainland. However, he was assassinated on his way to the Einfast Empire. However, this fact cannot be known to outsiders, so he announced his deacon It’s an emergency.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This has been the case for the past 20 years, but it is still the first major case in the history of the church. I just heard about it. But after Magnus’s sire, he used the half of the cane under Deken as the prop of the Knights of the Temple. I believe that everyone, including me, will be the shrine by the scepter. The Cavaliers have already regarded this as their ultimate goal. This must also be the intention of Magnus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis holds The hand of the scepter is shaking slightly, the weight of this thing is against her, or Any Temple Knights who are too heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I can guarantee that if you tell Magnus about this thing here, the first thing he has to do is to ask you personally. The life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not Asa, not Ai Mei. Said this is a thin, clean, long brown hair old woman, she is standing at the door, smiling and looking at the three uninvited guests in her house, holding a pocket of bread on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one, including Asa, found out how she appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you will come this time, but I didn't think you actually brought two such beautiful girls." The old woman’s eyes are Talis and Ai Meimei looked at them and smiled. "A very talented water magician, one is actually a knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman came over and patted Asa’s back and said, "Small Sa, you are growing up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mother, you are back." Asa smiled and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tallis did not make any swords, but her momentum has been very disturbed and tight. Although it seems to be just an ordinary woman who does not have the slightest threat, she knows that this is also an enemy that she can't deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if she is now gazing gazing at her, she also feels that her perception and attention are completely incapable of focusing on this person. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little girl, relax. Does the Knights of the Temple pull the sword to an old man who has no power?" Aier's mother-in-law is at the table. Put down your pocket and take out the bread and some daily necessities. Her expression is very relaxed and quiet, and it is indeed an old woman who just went shopping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
