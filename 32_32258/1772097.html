			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, Asa got up and dressed up and put on the clothes of a priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have known you for the first time. I saw you getting up in the morning and combing your face and wearing clothes very seriously. What happened? Ronis wants to introduce you to women. Friend?" Shandru stared at him. This old man has no respect for Asa’s future hero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just let me be a hero." Asa noticed whether her clothes were dressed properly. This is a must for the bishop of Ronis to have a hero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the plan of Bishop Ronis, he only knew that it was probably designed by the Marquis. This hunting is just a small prelude to pave the way for the grand plan of the bishops. As for the protagonist Asa is also to take advantage of this opportunity to make a good debut to lay a good foundation for the future. Although Asa has not been interested in the grand plan of the bishop, the incident itself is indeed quite interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When is the hero?" Shandrew frowned and said, "That's really a hard work. You must ask him for extra pay."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can go and talk to him if you have time. If you can get a salary, I can divide you half." Asa took the long sword brought with the costume. He actually didn't use this thing just to break his current identity and couldn't carry the rough knife on the street. And today, this thing is very easy to use, it doesn't matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that the hunting conference should have started Asa only before it goes out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he came out, he suddenly saw a few people in the distance looking around and seeing him immediately turned around and ran away. Asa did not care about dressing up and acting. These are just a few people on the street. It’s not worth mentioning that he is riding a horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is still walking slowly. The appearance of the heroes of the Marquis must be at the right time to show the momentum of turning the tide. The planned time is three or forty miles at noon, and now it is almost the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the king has more than ten miles and began to enter the inaccessible suburbs. A group of people suddenly rushed up from the woods on both sides and slammed Asa in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to have a thief robber near Wangdu. This team of fifty or sixty swordsmen is a mercenary Asa suddenly recognizes from the crowd. The person who leads the leader will know what happened to the person who monitored him. He shook his head and sighed: "I tell you that I can't spend time with you now. You better let me go. I don't want to wrinkle my clothes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I also tell you that you don't want to go back alive today." The prime minister, Moto screamed. Now the young aristocrats of the entire kingdom know that he was beaten by the god official and that he sent people to retaliate and did not succeed. He was finally taken away from the original position of his coveted official. He is now the object of discussion and ridicule by his companions. In this life, he has never been so arrogant. There are not many sensible sensations. I have long since disappeared. My father told him that he was not allowed to mess up. He also left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I took someone out of the morning to wait for you to come out. Don't think that you are a priest, I will not dare to move you. You think that there is a bishop of the dead old hood. Can you do it? What can I do if I kill you? No one knows where I am killing you? I still want to go to the hunting to want to please the emperor? Tell you not to dream, I already know that you want to Going to do something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you really know?" Asa shook her head in confusion. "It shouldn't be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angry prime minister said to a man with a head-on collar next to him: "Give me the guy. I said Ok, give you fifty gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come fifty?" Asa frowned. The night he was kidnapped by the imperial minister in Airy was worth hundreds of gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the Royal Hunting Conference is going on. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young Geffenhardt 17 and the distinguished guests of all countries rode their heads and bowed their arrows to the prey that was driven out of the jungle. There was no head of Roland and no old-fashioned military ministers who were able to accompany him. The emperor was so happy that he couldn’t help but be happy with his wise vision. He also tried hard to make the same effort as the other young men of this age to attract the attention of the Princess of the Duke next to him. Unfortunately, the princess put her mind on her chat with her sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already a lady dressed up as a little girl, hesitated and suddenly hesitated. "Then I went back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clys quickly took her. "Hey, you can't go. It's hard to come out. Why are you leaving? Since it is what you are afraid of when the Marquis is calling you out. Why didn't you come to the Marquis? He is a very interesting person, still a lot of people. The face of the man gave the Modo the bastard embarrassed. The fool could die and die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clys should be happy to play today. I also talked about the chores." The emperor finally couldn’t help but say. "Look at how many things I shot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clyss took the emperor’s hand and said, "Let’s hurry and give my sister a cover. An official and part-time job allows her to come out and do things without having to be in the house every day. My sister is very capable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Oh, okay." The young emperor was stunned by the delicate hand, and he made up his mind to make a good performance today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any monster emerges from the woods and kills himself, it’s best for the younger man to suddenly think like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near noon in the depths of the forest, five rogues are looking around to see the light coming from the gap between the leaves. They all prayed in their hearts that the light moved to the top of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few magical arrays on the ground behind them that are covered with black cloth. But one of them was constantly moving and squirming, and the low-pitched cockroaches shed a unique stench of a beast. The birds in the woods did not dare to fly. The rogues did not dare to face this group of creeping things. I was afraid that the things under the black cloth suddenly broke through the bondage and jumped out and had to turn their heads to look back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is still a good thing next to the magical array to make them uncomfortable. Although it is still covered by the black cloth, there is no slight movement. But as soon as it is close, there is a chill of silk straight from the back of the spine. After the boss’s command carefully carried them all into this magical array, there was once a curious daring to uncover a little bit and saw a small part but when the companion asked, the brave adventurer closed. Don't talk about it, just a pale face and a snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A difficult waiting for a rogue to find a gold coin from his arms. Other companions also took one out and took it in their hands to watch this cute little. thing. This is where they wait for motivation and now it seems that this can give them courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When these things are shipped, five people are needed, but five people are here to wait until noon." A rogue said. "These rich people can do something that people really don't understand..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are so many things to do, just know that you have the money to get it." A rogue screamed that he was the leader of the five. "In any case, as long as you have completed the instructions, you will have three gold coins per person. You don't want to take it yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone who heard this motivation They are all calm and look at the gold coins in their hands and imagine that they will instantly become four. This is indeed an exciting scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The time has come." A rogue looked at the sun and estimated it. "It should be noon. You can go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a minute. I have one more thing." The leader took out a thing from his pocket. Come on the ground. This is a pile of very fine grayish white powder that seems to be the ashes left behind after burning. The leader just put the pile of things down and curiously grabbed it. It seems that this pile of powder seems to be a whole dust between the dust as if there is a strange attraction. Just grab the part and pick up the other part and stick it on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't get anything done soon, let's go." Other companions urged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head put the dust down and took a handful, gently cut his finger and a few drops of bright red blood dripped on the pile of powder. The blood immediately soaked the strange powder to make it pink from gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it." The leader stood up and greeted his companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly the pile of powder moved like a hungry flea, and the jump was attached to the leader, which was still bleeding. At the same time, everyone on the finger hears the kind of 'Zizi' sound that people are when they drink soup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
