			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deepest part of the palace is in the sleeping hall of the Queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen looked at Rhodes Hart with the Cardinal and her whole face was nervously twitching. "You already know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I already know it." Rhodes nodded silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am no longer a human..." The Queen's voice took the tears in his eyes and the tears rolled down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not worry, it doesn't matter. Whatever you become, you are the same in my heart. You are still you." Rhodehett showed some The miserable smile reached out and touched the Queen's face and gently wiped her away. "So we both have no choice but we have no other way than to stand on the same line as the bishop. This time I and the bishop are looking for you to have something to help you. You listen to me and we want to... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Rhodes Hart was finished, the Queen trembled all over her body and said, "What? I want to call them all here to kill." "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just that the military’s four or five old guys are no big deal.” Bishop Jia Wei said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen shook his head: "No. General Thomas, the old Marquis of Minsk, the Minister of the Senate... These are the important ministers of the two dynasties and the return of Roland. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They can't come back." The Cardinal smiled and shook his head with a confidence that was overwhelming. "Even if they are not dead yet, as long as I am willing, I can guarantee that they will not come back. The biggest obstacles are no longer there. I can say that I have no scruples in this king. And how can you be assured of killing them?" It won't fall on us. Someone in this king will take it for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen looked at Cardinal and Rhodehart. It’s incredible to say: “Do you want to niche?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal smiled and shook his head: “篡 position? Impossible. We neither have this qualification to board. The throne is even less interested." He reached out and pointed his finger at the queen. "We just help the children in your stomach to go to the throne."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My child? I have no children..." The Queen shook her head in disbelief. She knows that she does not have and will never have children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can find a way for you to have it. Even if this is actually impossible, as long as I say yes, then no one will believe it or not. As long as these are the most The highly respected ministers are not in the hands of the three of us. As long as I make a little effort to become the regent, the responsibility of the emperor can naturally fall to the hands of Rhode Hart..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No~" The Queen screamed. If not the people around you have already been ordered to stay away from it, I am afraid that this will attract many people. She looked at the expression of Bishop Javey has been a little hysterical. "What the hell are you going to do? You want the Magic Academy, can I give you, you still threaten him? I also reach out to the empire..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said me There is no interest in this empire. He is interested in him." Bishop Jia Wei pointed to Rod Hart. "Do you think that I threatened him to let him stand with me? We are actually cooperation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Queen looks at Lot Hart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt shook his head and sighed. Say: "I'm going to delve into what it does? You just need to know that we can only do this now. You think about it if we don't do it, if one day you are killed, you are..." The safest and best way to do it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The queen trembled and shook her head and interrupted Rodhart’s words: "You are going to kill and you have to marry my sister." Do... Why do you want me to come in? I don’t want these..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt said slowly: "But since we were born, we I have to face it. So I want Bishop Jiawei to be together..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Face? Didn't I tell you to leave with me? How can we still have these things to face when we leave together? Just to seek for the arrogance for those powers. It is so good to say..." The Queen is already full of tears. She was unable to slide down slowly from the couch. Stumbled to the ground. "If you really love me, why don't you go with me? I am a woman and a woman doesn't want more than just having a favorite man to belong to one..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The queen raised her tears and looked at Rhodes Hart. In her impression, this man is always so gentle and so kind. It seems to be gentle and beautiful. These words in reality are all spokespersons. Other things seem to be invisible. It seems that this man can't have other emotions except those who are gentle and beautiful. Now I don't know why his voice and expressions are stirring things that I have never seen before. These things are harder, colder and heavier but also incomparable. This is the true emotion that has been deposited in his heart as a man's emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Men look farther and wider than women, and need to face more things, so even if you are so beautiful, you can’t bury your head in it, regardless of the other. Escape." Rhodeh also squatted down and held the Queen's shoulder. His current look is a bit strange. Although these are indeed his true feelings, it seems that his city and heart are not so easy to show in front of people. And his voice is getting deeper and more serious: "Come with me. Kelly. You will be with me when you want to be my woman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Tightly, Rhode Hart cried: "No... I beg you not to be like this... Can we leave together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Rhode Hart is slow Slowly broke away from the Queen's hand and stood up. He looked at the Queen's eyes with disappointment, sadness and sorrow, and a desolate decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cardinal who has been watching by the sidelines shook his head and sighed and said: "Clyice’s twists and turns over the years have not made you grow up. The little woman is gone. If you can have your sister so mature and mature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in the extreme grief, the Queen can’t help it because This strange thing is amazed at the bishop of Jia Wei. But Bishop Javi no longer looked at her but looked at Rhodehart and said, "How? Is it really as I said? There is no way to do this... She is only a little woman after all. These things she bears I can't afford it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt still looks at the queen with that look. The color of the pain is getting heavier and heavier. Finally, he twisted his head and whispered: "In fact, I already knew it just... I still hope..." His voice is getting lower and lower. "Forget it...you do it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crying the Queen of the Mainland, she felt the sharpness of her limbs before she had any reaction. Pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long sword with white magic shines a bright sword in the air and then falls into the scabbard of the Cardinal's waist. The Queen screamed and lie on the ground. The wound on her hands and feet had a black smoke. Bishop Jia Wei waved the white magic light to completely cover the Queen's figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't struggle. Your blood is awakened for too short. The strength is too weak. The key is that I am completely awakened for you, so you are similar to the doll in my hand. Don't blame me or blame your lover. We have given you the opportunity to blame you for not accepting it. If you don't want to take the initiative to help but know too much, you will sacrifice more than we live to help us." Bishop Jia Wei Pull the queen up and put it on the bed. The Queen’s hands and feet pumped * moved. The mouth was also opened. But it is not used in this white magical light, she can not only move, but she can't even speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A year ago, the vampire bites the empress and the next thing is known, plus the cardinal and the priests of the School of Magic. No matter whether others are willing to believe this or not, it is absolutely impossible to refute. As long as this identity is determined, then many of the following things can be taken into account, such as the collusion with the Descartes of the Emperor and the head of Roland... As soon as possible, get the old guys to take over the Paladin. I took over the Magic Academy and supported you. This huge Ian Fast Empire is your bag." Bishop Javey took a shot of Rhode Hart. Said the shoulder. "Abandoning a relationship and getting a country. How can this account be worthy of cooperation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt still dare not go to the queen of the bed though he The expression is still mainly silent, but there are some unspeakable excitement. The two different emotions make his expression strange. After a long silence, he asked Bishop Jia Wei: "Give me this country? Do you really want nothing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal faintly said: "I said that I only need you to master the country and then send troops to attack Oufu. It is only a woman who wants to destroy what you want. The woman I want is not the kind." Little woman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The queen lying on the bed, though unable to move, can still speak but can still cry and can be sad. If the heart can really hurt, then her current heart is already riddled with holes. I personally watched my own favorite and most dependent man to discard himself as a prop to a stepping stone. This is the most deadly damage to any woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
