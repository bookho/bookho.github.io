			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the headquarters of the Paladin is pushing the front of the road and questioning people to the room of the Paladin team leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'pound' solid thick wooden door was kicked by the man. Some of the surrounding swordsmen are already drawing swords, but Captain Rod Hart, who is reviewing the documents inside, sees this rude person but seems to care less and is very friendly and nods to him: "You are coming back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsmen just breathed a sigh of relief and finally someone recognized that this person is a priest of the church. However, this sacred official rushed to the face of the friendly Captain Rod Hart. This slap in the face fluttered him out and smashed the documents that fell in the hands of the ground all over the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The swordsmen of '呛' all draw their swords in their hands<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt from Climb up on the ground. His half-face was completely swollen and bloody, but still calm and as usual, he waved his hand to the swordsmen who were arrogant. "All go out and close the door without my order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsmen are all at the door. They haven’t reacted yet. The sect of the priest is on the face of the captain who just stood up. The captain of the imperial paladin actually did not have any resistance. It just stood up and wiped out the nosebleed blood. The subordinates could still command very majesticly: "Is it not heard of my order? Going out and closing the door." My order is not allowed to come in and no one else is allowed to know the things here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain’s order is that the absolute swordsmen only see them when they quit the door. The captain’s head and stomach were punched again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have enough?" Rodhart stood up and asked his face to swollen and his head and nose were bleeding but the gentleness was kind. The look does not seem to be affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa grabbed his collar and lifted him up against the wall and asked him coldly: "I just came over from the square and you said what you said." Is that the solution?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only that way." Rodhart’s face and voice are equally calm. "All the officials of Airy know that they are falling. We all know that I will send them back so I can't just kill them. And only the crime of killing the imperial minister will be brought to them by the king to kill them through trial." We can completely elute the suspects. If they save them, they will not be able to save our own future. The plan of Bishop Dr. Ronis is completely destroyed. You know how important it is. Under the weight of the weight, only the bishop can do this. This is also the case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop Rooney knows this too?" Asa asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodha features: "I asked the bishop when I came back the day before yesterday"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When Clausue and Asa left the team together, Rod Hart immediately ordered the troops to move forward and returned to the kingdom in only three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the highest leader of the army along the way, as long as he wants to meet with fellow villagers. But Rod Hart did not do this. He didn't dare because he already knew how to solve this problem. Bishop Ronis had already made some hints before he went to Airy to justify the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to solve this, you must do it. But he is still a 20-year-old young man. After all, he has always had a heart for those fellow villagers. There is not much time for him to choose. He has to make a choice as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He arranged the troops outside the city for the time being and did not enter the city and went to the Magic Academy to see Bishop Ronis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of Ronis had just received a report from Ali, and he was very happy and excited. Although the person who wrote the report did not know what was going on with the weird phenomenon, he could show the things from the description. Even he himself did not expect that the pagan incident there would have been a ghost of the Necromancer Association. They did not think that they had found a way to solve the solar well enchantment that countless magicians could not do for thousands of years. The most unexpected thing was Sa himself was able to solve this dangerous thing perfectly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whispering of the whispering of the whisper is also just the right thing. Those elves that are ancient are not the most difficult to communicate. They have no obstacles. The Sierra Forest is more likely to accept their own. The alliance treaty Asa protects the world tree leaves and a surviving elf should be enough to eliminate all the scruples and hostility of the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Elni family in the imperial political arena has already smashed the other characters of the military, but the military with no ambition and means is the Duke of Mulak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great means of the Duke’s ambition is even more brilliant. It is inevitable that the only way to cover the sky will not allow other forces to rise to Bishop Ronis. It is bound to interfere with the establishment of the alliance. However, Bishop Rooney did not worry about him. If he did not take a shot as a hermit, he would have been surprised and effective. In consultation with his friend Inham, he had already taken a small measure a few days ago. Waiting to see amazing results is all right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time Rodhart looked at him with a strange look to make him feel an unpredictable foreboding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s true that Rod Hart’s report is really serious. He also couldn't think of Asa actually holding this kind of thing around him so much that he was completely unprepared. In this case, if the Duke of Mulak seized the handle, it means that all efforts are immediately lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bishop adults ask me what should I do now?" Rodhart asked in a desperate Chinese company seeking revelation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Rooney looked at his eyes and said, "What do you think you should do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I don't know." Rodhart bowed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know." The candle-like eyes of Bishop Ronis clarified the meaning of Rod Hart's every move. "The color of pain on your face tells me that you actually know that you just don't dare to make a choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am afraid to choose too Can't choose." Rod Hart looked confused and painful. "I owe them a lot, I shouldn't have it again"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't?should?" The bishop was keenly aware of these two words and immediately understood Rod Hart. The mind. "There has never been a thing in the world that should or should not be done. You only want to do it and you have the ability to do it." He sighed deeply. "The light of justice also has a price to sacrifice. The heart of good sympathy is absolutely the most precious, but if you look at it from a long-term perspective, you must give up sometimes because there are more people whose lives and happiness are waiting at the far end of another place. If you go to save this thing, I will not interfere with what you choose to do in your own way. No matter what kind of choices you have, I will not blame you." Although this is said, the bishop is finally making up. "Because I know that you are a sensible person and a person who knows how to do big things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know the weight..." Asa murmured. Looks weird. Because he doesn't know what to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Weigh the pros and cons. We can only do this." Rodhart’s nose is still bleeding and his eyes are blue and the linen is The color of the head is also chaotic, but the look is not inconspicuous. "This is also for your future. Bishop Ronis said that there are still many important things waiting for you to make this sacrifice inevitably."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The future?" Asa smiled coldly. Drop Rodhart on the ground. "Let's do your big things slowly. I haven't wanted to do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School of Magic. Bishop Ronis and three great priests are receiving the Adra bishop from the magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop of Adela and the Bishop of Ronis are one of the archbishops of the church, but he is not the same as the Bishop of Ronis who is alone in the empire. He is serving From a certain point of view, the Pope is a close confidant of His Majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelaide is a young man in his thirties. The temperament is elegant and generous, and it looks very good. It is somewhat different from the dignity between men and women. It is almost unthinkable to be able to achieve this status at his age. In addition to explaining that there are some things that are not known to him, the ability is naturally essential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been busy with the affairs of the East for many years and have not returned to see the Pope. I also asked Bishop Adela to help me to plead guilty to the Pope." Bishop Ronis In the chair, a pair of eyes half open and half-closed inside the two green fires seem to have no spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adela Bishop smiled and his smile looked a little shy: "Where. His Majesty the Pope has always praised you for his outstanding achievements here in the Empire. In your Under the auspices, the School of Magic is so high in the empire that it is one of the most important subordinate institutions of the Holy See. It is also reasonable for you to be so busy with the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I came to convey the message of His Majesty the Pope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Rooney said lazily: "What message? Please ask a cardinal to pass a message. It’s very important.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelaide is still smiling and said: “About you to propose to the church to unite the forces of various countries to destroy the Necromancer’s Association. Things..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is weird." Bishop Rooney snorted. "It seems that I haven't sent a letter to the Holy See yet." He turned his head and looked at the Cousbert's great priest next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great gods face is not very good, the forehead starts to sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This proposal has been mentioned to the Pope a few times before. And recently, there is a sentiment against the Necromancer on the 6th side of Dongda 6. Let's lead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be the thing that God's believers destroy from the dirty and evil things is what we should do?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true. But the Pope said that there are still many pagans in the big 6 that have not been returned to the embrace of God. Deli Valley is just a drop in the ocean. And if the situation is sinister, if it is to be confiscated, it will surely cause the lives of countless gods to die. So the meaning of His Majesty the Pope is to focus on..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Is this really what the Pope meant?" Bishop Ronis interrupted the words of Adela. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces of the three big priests are not very good looking. Although it is not appropriate to say that the prestige of the position of Bishop Rooney in the Holy See is such a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really the meaning of the Pope’s majesty.” The face of Adela’s bishop’s face was still so amiable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Rooney waved lazily. "Well, I don't have to say any more. I haven't officially made this suggestion to His Majesty the Pope. You don't have to worry about it first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelaide Bishop's courtesy Nodded. "We know that every bit of evil and darkness can't be tolerated for your devout faith. But I also hope that you will consider everything from the big picture. We are very clear about the personal grievances between you and Deva Valley. I am very considerate of you, so I hope..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two points in the eyes of Bishop Rooney have never been spiritual. The green fire suddenly flourished and almost the green light shines. Adelaide's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelaide Bishop closed his mouth very interestingly but the smile on his face remained undiminished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the two green fires in the eyes of Bishop Ronis re-dimmed. He didn’t have the spirit to wave his hand and announce the end of the conversation. "Okay. Nothing to say. I already know the meaning of His Majesty the Pope. I am very tired, let's go first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three great priests accompany Ade After the bishop went out, Bishop Adela appointed the chief censor of Cuthbert to lead him to inspect the situation of the School of Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are doing very well." When there was no other person around, Adela's bishop whispered. "Reporting the situation here to the Holy See in time is enough to show your loyalty to the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. My loyalty to His Majesty the Pope and the Archbishops can definitely And the devoutness of God is comparable.” In the face of the self-dead Bishop Adela, the great priest was completely devoid of the stereotypes and majesty of the past. The more he is now, the more he has reported the situation here to the Holy See because of his impulsive impulses and dissatisfaction. "I think the practice of Bishop Ronis is a bit ill. It's right to raise some inexplicable newcomers for no reason." He remembered an important thing and whispered. "Bishop Roones was very angry when he proposed to the church a few years ago to annihilate Deva Valley and was vetoed. He said to himself what some of your bishops have benefited from Nopolino..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nopolino Notte?" Hearing the name of the Adelaide, the face changed slightly but immediately restored the gentle smile. "Mr. Nopolino is a devout and charitable person. Every year, the church donates a lot. It is probably a special prejudice of the Bishop of Ronis to the businessman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
