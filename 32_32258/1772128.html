			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of the Duke’s study, the Duke of Mulak, is happy and busy with the affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite these so many important things in the past two days, the Emperor still remembers to have given this post to the Duke’s position. But to tell the truth, the Duke did not care much about this. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title of the prime minister is not so much a slap in the face, it is better than saying that it is not more expensive than eating a small piece of bread. The eldest daughter is already the finance minister, the youngest daughter will soon become the emperor, the military ministers are made by his exquisite wrists, and the Elni family is almost completely finished. Who is this position not allowed to come to him? So the Duke is not happy. This is a happy other thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the study opened with a uniform of savvy financial ministers holding a stack of documents and came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small 懿 put the file in front of the Duke and said: "This is the loss report of the battle of the sorcerer who killed the sorcerer. The warriors and the magicians of the fallen In a short period of time, Kim re-selected so many high-ranking soldiers from all over the country to add the cost of the Knights. The total cost of the collection was 2,359 gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke glanced at the various budgets on the file and the budget was clearly defined. He nodded and satisfied with a sigh. I remembered the big battle two days ago. He really hasn’t been so surprised and happy for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four members of the Fifty Paladins were killed in the battle of the Necromancer before the day before. This is his surprise, and he is still amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the biggest and most amazing loss since the establishment of the Paladin. It was with the help of nearly a thousand pastors and magicians to deal with a Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time ago the Duke knew that this eccentric old man who had actually met the bishop’s adult was definitely a master. After the last time the prime minister had made a mistake, he It is already certain that this old man is indeed a Necromancer. Probably because of other uninformed hidden feelings, they lived here under the private protection of the bishops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop is actually a big secret to a fellow necromancer. However, because he did not want to expose his Duke, he did not get the news out. In the end, it finally proved that this is indeed a wise choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the relationship between this strange old man and the priest? What is the relationship between the old man and the bishop? These dukes don’t want to go deeper. It’s just that the bishop’s adult is already dead. This person who knows that the murderer will never be the priest’s boy is inevitably a huge hidden danger. Moreover, he is still a friend of the bishop’s adult or a sorrowful necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although his strength should be unfathomable, the Duke had already experienced a little bit of fur before. The ability to force this swordsman to the murderous and imposing manner to the incompetent magician is absolutely comparable to that of the bishop of Ronis and the prime minister's ending is also a good illustration of the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is useless to be ten times more powerful under the Duke’s means. However, it is only natural that an unidentified Necromancer can use the Paladin and the School of Magic to remove it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the Duke never imagined that the battle was so hard. Just killing him alone has actually killed so thrilling and dark. The battle was short, but the flame blasted the gas light.... The frenzied magical elements and the temperament of the swordsmanship and the last ten corpses and the Necromancer's powerful self-destruction were even more incredible. Even under the eyes of the Duke’s self-cultivation, it was completely shocked. Fortunately, the big house was damaged in the most remote places on the edge of the kingdom, and only a few insignificant streets damaged more than a hundred people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Duke was ecstatic after the shock, especially when he saw the captains of the two Paladins and a dozen swordsmen because they were too close to the Necromancer When he was directly smashed by the huge explosive force, he almost applauded the necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How about the budget for the redevelopment of that block?" asked the Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister immediately took out another one-inch-thick document and wrote all the expenses in great detail. “The total is about 2,300 gold coins. The project is too much budget can only be accurate to this point.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the same time, there are inevitably some arbitrariness in these two expenditures. Only in other areas can the spending and the replenishment of the Paladins be reduced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Secretary of the Treasury’s crisp and clear voice continued to read the tone of the official document: “No matter what the circumstances, the integrity and combat effectiveness of the Paladin should be guaranteed. It is the foundation of the stability of the Empire and the system that the Empire has not changed for hundreds of years. And if you don’t immediately transfer the reconstruction cost to the military ministers, you will also comment on me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The system is dead and the situation is alive. Now In the neighboring countries, the country and the war can't afford to be able to slow down on this. As for how long it takes to stay, "naturally, when you feel comfortable, the Duke's mouth will not smile." "You don't have to worry about the military minister. I will naturally explain it to them. This matter is very important. I will personally assist the head of Roland to handle it... Hehe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is anything in this empire that he must have to worry about, then it is the Paladin. Under normal circumstances, the staffing of this group is extremely strict and almost all of them are taken over by the head of Roland. Therefore, even if the Duke has any thoughts and means, he can only hope to sigh. But now the loss of the person created by the respectable and lovely Necromancer is undoubtedly a great opportunity. It’s simply a matter of delaying the funds to find someone to get into the opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The Finance Minister responded faintly to the file. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A footstep is far and near. The powerful metal sole of the knight and the owner's unsteady action tapping on the floor is just a feeling of youthful energy from the sound. And the interval between each step is exactly the same, which shows that his extraordinary self-control is strict and meticulous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study door opened a young knight and came in. Like his footsteps, he has an impeccable rider, every move and even every expression shows the perfect knight style. He is not a good assistant who seems to be a duke as if he was born as Clovis. Although his appearance is equally handsome and straightforward, he does not have the softness and murderousness of Clausue's overflow and is soft and easy to get close to. He is the new assistant of the Duke, Rod Hart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days ago, Bishop Ronis was assassinated by the sect of the Necromancer, and the Duke of the Kings had just gone to annihilate the Necromancer. Soon after, Rod Hart came to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Duke of the Duke, I came to be your assistant." Rodhart said that even the Duke had some unexpectedly opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke smiled and said in a somewhat disrespectful tone: "Where is it. Lord Rodhart is now a newcomer deliberately trained by the military. I don't have such a big face." Let you be my deputy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Duke of the Duke, I am here to trust you." Rodhart is very sincere and very humble but never The humble kneeling tone once again expresses his own intentions. "I am now in the military's future. I am also a small captain in the Paladin. I am smart enough to know how to move forward and backward. With my help you can manipulate the military more conveniently. I will definitely do better than Clause. Better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What you mean is that you have more value in your own use." The Duke's smile is a bit ridiculous but more appreciated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. I can help you a lot." Rodha features heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a smart person." The Duke looked at him meaningfully and nodded. "It's really smart to be a big man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of Ronis is dead. He had hoped that the big patrons that the Duke would care for were no longer friends. It will soon become the biggest wanted man in the Big 6. Although it seems that the situation in the DPRK is not bad, but the Duke who has already covered the sky will never let go of this once consciously want to stand on its own, have the potential to have the mind and ambition and know a lot of things. People's. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confrontation with the Duke is undoubtedly unwise. No matter the difference in the status of the means of power, it is not reasonable. And the battle is always the last means of the most mindless. So Rodhart immediately chose a road that seemed to be almost mad by others - re-entering the Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to see such a situation requires an incomparable vision and mind. And to make this choice, it is necessary to have a big deal and an unconstrained chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know how long it has been said so straightforwardly with people." The Duke sighed with a little emotion. Smiling and looking at the young man who is always in good faith, he does have something to move. "I believe that you must be very capable. At least when I am at your age, there is absolutely no such vision and temperament as you are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;罗De Hart silently waited for the Duke's decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke still looks at the face with a smile and says: "But I also know that you are very ambitious. Do you think I will put A dangerous person who is so smart and ambitious and deeper is left to wait for him when he stabs me with a knife?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt did not speak Standing there very humbly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But if you come, it means that you are judged that I will accept your trust? You guess now that your judgment is right or wrong? The duke's eyes narrowed and he bent his fingers and slowly tapped on the table. "And... what would be the result if it was wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the judgment is wrong, the Duke did not accept the suggestion and the result is likely to be even The gates of the Dukes House could not go out. He has shown such a understanding of the Duke's character and current situation that the Duke will naturally not let him go and he will not even give him the opportunity to escape. He used to be so close to the spies of the Necromancer, but this reason can already be used to kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt still stood still. Only the duke of the duke's boring percussion in the room fell on the rhythm of every heartbeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half he finally spoke up. His voice was steady and clear, and there was no fluctuation in emotions. "I won't guess because I am my own judgment. And it's not just my choice." His eyes are not allowed. Look at the duke. "It's also your choice is correct or not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tapping of the Duke's finger was ended with a stress. "Then I will tell you that your judgment is correct." His smile is not only satisfied but also with other things is actually fighting spirit. "I will leave you by my side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for the Duke of the Lord." Rodhart bowed to the Duke. From this moment on, he became a friend of his subordinates from the abandonment of the Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No thanks. You also know that I am not for you but for myself. Not only because you have value for me but also because of you. Threat.” The Duke stood up and looked out of the window with a ambition and ambition. "No one in this country is my opponent. Without an opponent, there is no threat. And the beast that lives in a world without a sense of crisis will slowly degenerate. So I will leave you except you." In addition to helping me to do things, I can always keep my vigilance at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the study, Rod Hart took a very standard ceremony and presented the previous one. Report: "Duke of the Dukes This is what the current staff of the Paladins are arbitrarily arranging for vacancies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke took over The report was put aside and smiled and looked at Rodhart. "What is your position in the group now? Is the head of Roland set down?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rodhardt squatted and replied: "Replace the captain of the original fourth squad and lead thirty swordsmen to a fire magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The duke smiled and nodded: "Right. How is the injury of the head of Roland?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to the two great priests of the School of Magic who came back from the Holy See in time, there is nothing wrong with them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, that's good." But the Duke’s eyebrows, as slender as the eyes, were unfortunately ticked. If there is any small defect in this surprise, then this is the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five members of the team of four captains. This vacancy is indeed a great gift left to the Duke. But the Duke would rather have these members not die or even out of the air for five hundred. It doesn't matter if one can gloriously succumb to his job - the head of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the case, perhaps the Duke’s adult may be more than a hundred times more happy than he is now, perhaps even quietly setting up a bronze statue in the basement for the respectable Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the death of Bishop Ronis, the death of the Holy Knights. The distribution of the situation of Wang Du’s entire power situation has changed. This is a big shuffle. Some cards will disappear. Some cards will change positions to create another role. The nature that most controls the direction of these cards is the Duke, the best player in political power. Such as Rod Hart this card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke asked: "Is the wanted order for the murderer gone?" If this potential hidden danger is completely eliminated, it can almost be said that the whole king is The cards are already in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Emperor’s heartbroken heart has added a reward in addition to the five thousand gold coins proposed by Bishop Ronis. Can capture this person’s imperial Fenghou first class "Rodhardt's voice is not so steady and concise. "The wanted order has been distributed to every part of the empire as soon as possible and sent messengers to the countries to negotiate the transfer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the church?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The magical school's wanted order has been handed over to the church. I heard that His Majesty the Pope is also extremely angry and went straight to all parishes and affiliates."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke was satisfied with the nod and said with a little sigh: "This evil mad criminal really needs to deal with this. His Majesty has actually made such a heavy reward. Five thousand gold coins, although the Holy See has to share a little But it really is a big burden on the national treasury. I don't know who will get such an amazing reward?" He looked at Rod Hart with a smile and asked, "Do you want it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhart thought for a moment and shook his head and replied: "I can't catch him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many things It doesn't matter that strength is mainly a method problem. I believe that you understand very well. Because you are a smart person to do big things. People. "Duke of adults smiled at his new deputy. "What did the spy file in the School of Magic find out? For example, where is his home at home?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. Now those It’s all forged.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Oh, it’s a spy.” The Duke nodded and asked Rod Hart. "You and the spies were friends too. Do you know the details of him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." Rodhart shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke nodded and turned his head to look at the finance minister. "So you must know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I don't know." Xiaoyan's eyes met coldly with the Duke and looked down at the file. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke smiled. "You didn't know it. Then I will tell you all. Just a long time ago, I knew some clues from some places and now suddenly recalled... This spoiled home should have a blacksmith in the Karendo Basin. Father. The folk customs there are such an extraordinary person that it is easy to find out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand. I immediately went to Karen. More." Rodha features nodded turn and exit. The rhythmic and distinct rhythm of the footsteps is the same as when he came, but he gradually drifted away with his figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke suddenly remembered the first time to chase this person. However, after taking such a big circle, the situation is completely different now. I no longer have to worry about what I can do to use it. The ending of the kid is almost tangible under his own subtle and subtle means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a bit of a sigh for the duke who actually needs to spend so long to deal with it. In the middle, there were so many things and the changes of the agreement of Oufu, the actions of Bishop Ronis... but after all, they laughed at the end with a victory. I thought it would be a bit reluctant to solve this problem by the opponent Duke who had spent so much effort and so many victories. He was satisfied and sighed a little sadly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you do this again?" Xiao Yan said suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't?" The Duke was a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You let him go. Don't do this anymore." Xiao Yan looked up and saw the pleading in the eyes of the Duke. "He won't say what you are doing. Other things he has no interest at all. Why do you have to do this? How many people are you killing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
