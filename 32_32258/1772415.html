			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, all the zombies are no longer paying attention to the coalition forces that are on the verge of collapse, but all rushed to the few people behind the dazzling swordsman. These undead souls, which have always been quiet, are now mad like each other, squeezing each other to a more violent posture than the orcs. The tsunami of this undead has gathered an unprecedented peak to crush them down with brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Light Cross Sword looks very small under this endless undead as if it is a trivial one, but all the dead souls are either zombies or ghosts or even ghosts. The magic of the corpse witch is also smashed and smashed under the white sword light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the power of Lancelot alone. Rolande gathered all the swordsmen of the Paladin swordsman swordsmanship and still stay there. On the track. The Holy Light Cross Sword will be superimposed on it and this is the joint sword of the two strongest swordsmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No zombies have the ability to withstand such a sword. No matter how flexible these zombies are, how much they have recovered to the fighting power and agility of life. use. All the power has gathered above this point. This is the scent of swords and swords. This sword was born in a fiercely fierce tsunami, and a small but violent wave of waves bursting with the waves of the people behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sword that has long been in the saga. The tens of thousands of squadrons of the tens of thousands of troops are all muddy in order to attack this place near the final barrier. Such a sword. They will use this strongest sword to kill the blackest black before the group. It’s a pity that reality is never what the plan can predict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight Titan giant zombies held up their hands with huge air elements mixed with the smell of the black star and condensed eight huge gray thunderballs appeared in them Hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Titans who have the seal in the Dark Star, even if they can't catch up with the legendary Titan Giant who manipulates the Thunder, have at least a small half of the Titan's power. And even the real Titans don't have the same common sense of these zombies under the Dark Star. There are several different angles of different distances. The huge gray thunderballs hit the speeding spurs of the Holy Light Cross Sword at the same time. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s just a two or three four-thunder ball, no matter how big the ball is, how can it be condensed before the sword The ice is disintegrated but this is eight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight gray spaces that are clustered together seem to start to split. The power that condenses on one point has passed the curse of the sword, and the sword is finally broken with this gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent whirl of the torn bang of the bangs and the gray electric light splattered around the surrounding unexploded high-rise undead tsunami like a storm The sand pile is scattered in the air and is twisted into a fine powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Cross Cross Sword has become a black and white. It’s just that this sword and swordsmanship are still broken and still resist the zombie Titan’s fall. The human hair is not damaged. They will face huge monsters dozens of times taller than them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a dozen dragons are screaming at the green flames of the wings that have already flown in the mouth. Although this is not an ordinary dragon's breath, it is the same fire of the dead spirit. But I haven’t even flown to these giants and suddenly planted them on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few times these dragons were actually torn apart. These are not simply fragile skeletons. The black skeleton of the dead star is harder than granite. All the skeletal behemoths around him also fell to the ground in the thunder and together with other zombies rushing here. The sand that they had already frozen had suddenly become a quicksand that was gradually consuming their bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granden’s face is a dead-like gray, still sitting cross-legged on the ground and coldly thinking about the mantra. Even the sacred and black gas worn by the special sacramental amulet of the church is too heavy. The white light on his body has been like the candle in the wind under the scent of the Dark Star. He is surrounded by Lancelot Gru and Asa. It’s just that they are in the middle of the gravity field. They are also difficult to move. Everyone’s body is full of vindictive light to support the body and not fall into the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gravity field is the only magic that can have a great effect on the king of the dead. Even the king of the undead and the black star will not be immune to gravity. The law of nature makes the Granden Tower Lord a candidate for the final goal. But now in this case his gravity field has to be used first in this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghosts of the sky can no longer be compared with the blizzard but like a blizzard that has exploded. The gray, transparent, scorpion ghosts layered on top of each other and rolled over them. Only those undead can be disturbed by the gravity field and the middle person seems to be...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roll." A slamming drink is abrupt. Grouong stood with a long bow against the ghosts of the sky. Needless to say, fear and fear, even the things like anger and hostility and fighting spirit in his eyes are not in his eyes. The ghosts and ghosts that come from this are even less than the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghosts will not hear more, but all the ghosts close to him will be shaken away with this sound and those who are not close will Do not dare to approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the magic or the effect of vindictiveness is not the power of words but the direct power of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the remaining ghosts converge in the direction of the skeleton behemoths and then gather like a tidal wave to the transparent ghost body of several skeleton dragons. Melting and merging all the ghosts in the sky disappeared and appeared on the faucet of the skeleton were several pale phantoms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer is the ghost of the transparent air-like body, although slender and faint, but it is already a solid body and the face is no longer fuzzy The embarrassing shackles are a pale, skinny woman's face. This is the dead soul banshee that the top-level undead monsters have gathered with tens of thousands of ghosts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banshee all open their mouths, the darkness in the air suddenly all toward their mouths, go to the pale air-conditioned big mouth like a bottomless tone, madly swallowing the space The darkness of the next second of the dead spirits of the banshee will be sprayed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But only half a second later, these dead sluts and their brewing screams disappeared together with the standing skeleton keel. Slightly past, whether it is a phantom or a real thing, everything has become a fragment of flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru still stood there in the central area of ​​the gravity field. He finally lifted the phantom bow in his hand. I didn't even aim at the sights. I just randomly pulled the strings and counted the green light. From the bow, I turned the dead banshee into a sky full of debris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if he’s because of the blood of the elf, although he’s holding a bow from the episode, but he’s holding this longbow’s shooting position. The bow and arrow array is more skillful and more natural. This bow is a natural part of the body that has been used for many years as if it were part of the body. The light from the bow is no longer the same as in the hands of the Elf Patrol. If Kelly shoots it, it can be regarded as an arrow. This is the robber used in siege. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru's vindictive light began to illuminate and the greater green light continually shot from the bow. Whether it is the zombie Titan or the Snapdragon, this continually blinks in the air to make a smashing green dragon in the air to turn all the things in front of the road into fly ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gravitational field is already gradually weakening. This is, after all, a great magic that is comparable to the curse. No matter how deep the earth magic is, Master Granden can't last too long. Some giant beasts are no longer sinking into the sand and trying to stand up, but the green arrows are just flashing past these giant beasts and immediately become fragments of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the sound of the shouting sounds in the endless darkness of a group of green and white light rising from the sky. This ray is actually not too strong and dazzling, but the darkness around it has signs of retreating.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a strong ray. The group light is now like the sun that suddenly appears in the sea of ​​death. With the long whistling sound, the sun violently burst into the green light of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding zombies have already accumulated as mountains and there are mountains and mountains above the mountains. But in this dazzling green light, the mountains where these undead gathers are gradually collapsing and disappearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first sea of ​​undead was really completely passively disturbed. Everyone who sees this has the feeling that this boundless darkness will immediately break open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that the real sun is the suffocating Gru. The four scattered nature is not the sun, but the arrow light from the phantom bow in his hand. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
