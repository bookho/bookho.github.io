Although the face can't see the original appearance, the brilliance armor on the corpse is something more conspicuous than the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can the Knights of the Temple appear here?" Tima High Priest asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it was sent by Celeste." Sedros replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of Tima did not speak, and his face was still in doubt. There is absolutely no reason for Celeste to easily send the remaining Knights of the Temple to such a deep enemy. In the environment of Oufu, no one can easily hide, no matter what kind of mission, let a shrine knight Wearing a glorious battle armor, just coming here is just a death. The pope obviously does not do such stupid things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this person is not a Knight of the Temple." Tema High Priest was amazed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? How? How can this body be a brilliant armor?" Sedros frowned. "This is the treasure of Celeste. There is absolutely no possibility of counterfeiting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The armor is a shining armor, but the person is not a knight. This person's Although the physique is strong, but the shape of the muscles is not coordinated as a whole, it is not a body that a master should have. And if it is a knight, how can it be fatal if it is hit by a person? Those physical works seem to be after his death. "There is nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sedros slowly nodded and admired: "The high priest is really a gaze... but only the high priest can have such an observation. And judgement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My friend, what do you mean by me to see this dead person?" asked Tima High Priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, no, I am not letting you come to see him. This is just a prop... I want you to see someone else." Sedros shook his head slightly and smiled. "Accurately, he wants to see you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who?" Looking at the smile of Sedros, the Tima priest suddenly had a strange feeling. It seems as if a curtain is about to be uncovered, revealing the feeling of a terrible monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I." A voice sounded. A man came out from a few shrubs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it you?" The voice of Tima's high priest suddenly rose and took a step back. Basile was screaming and flew straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dark-haired man, dressed casually. But no matter who sees him, it is impossible to reproduce a little bit of casual feeling. He is the god of war of Oufu, Gru. For the two high priests of Tema and Basil, he is a higher existence. In the rare case of Moriel, he is actually the black elf and the king of the whole Nigan, but also the strongest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he left Nigan, the Thamma priest had a chance to have the burden to carry out his rebellion. Suddenly seeing him here, the feeling of accumulation over the years has scared the two tribal leaders almost out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the priest of Tima immediately calmed down. Since I have to rely on Oufu, I have already thought that there will be a day to face him. The previous discussion with Sedros also said that he had a problem with him. The high priest immediately nodded to Gru: "Hello, I haven't seen you for a long time, Mr. Gru."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has been a long time since I saw it... I can’t see it. To both of you." Gru's eyes were on the faces of the two tribal leaders, and there was some color of nostalgia in the eyes of the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s an honor to be able to see you again." Tima High Nod nodded. He is also looking at the fellows who have been missing for a long time, and the surprise in their hearts is getting heavier and heavier. "You seem to be much more powerful than before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his impression this is by no means a person who will be hiding. Because it is like a volcano that erupts all the time, even if he hides his body shape, he can't hide that kind of momentum. But just now he did not feel his presence until he came out. Standing in front of himself, the momentum is completely filled with feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
