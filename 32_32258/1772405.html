That is to say, the world has been destined for all his trajectories as an endless straight line since its formation? That is to say, when is the spit and spit in the place where the urinary urinary falls in what place will drown how many ants pissed when the mood is happy or comfortable or because the urine is not smooth and frustrated, these are great fate to us. Arranged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not like being drunk but actually getting drunk. His hand is carrying a jug full of luxurious clothes. The wrinkles and the traces of the wine are always neat and tidy. The head is also messy. It’s so deep that you can drunk all the women’s eyes. Now they are drunk by their own drunkenness. It’s a mess. He smiled and looked at the arrogant two people sullenly laughing and said: "You don't have to argue and don't have to be so nervous. Because in essence, this dark star is the king of the dead and is flooded by a bubble." The dead ants are the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because you are too disappointed with Hamm." The voice of the lich seems to be squeezed out of his throat. These tones smashed the person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, sorry." The Marquis finally came over and leaned against the body against a large obsidian. "But I think you should have gotten used to it? After all, I remember from 20 years ago that I seem to be constantly disappointing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really I am very disappointed, whether it is before or now. I really regret why I agreed to introduce you to Deva Valley."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that it is even more sorry." I thought that you would be very happy at that time." The Marquis suddenly suddenly laughed like he thought of something, and even the laughter was full of wine. "You regret it? This is also a part of the great destiny. What do you regret? Since the king of the dead spirit has pulled up the great moment of the dark star, you have foreseen that there is a long-term arrangement. You have not seen this little thing before. "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your present virtue is simply an insult to the Necromancer, a noble title. You are insulting the sacred place of the Descartes." Lich The face could not see the expression and only saw that the fire in her eyes seemed to fly out to burn the Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what do you think the Necromancer should be? Be like them, wait for the great King of the Dead to turn them all into zombies. "The Marquis squatting pointed at the peak of the Shadow Mountain Range. From the bottom up, the rich black gas has covered all the shadows." "You are Shant and Nice. They are all old guys who have lived for decades and are stiff. For them, even if they are not the servants of the King of the Dead, there are not many days to pass. Maybe this is the case for them now. Words are still the best ending, at least not as much as you pay for the conversion to a bone shelf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the destiny of the Necromancers You don't even understand that you are not qualified to be a Necromancer. Or should I turn you into a corpse now?" Vide Nina said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Marquis still seems to be so happy to be drunk. Happiness is even higher than this black breath. He laughed: "I understand the old saying that even if people are not doing well, how can they do God to be a ghost? The people who say the fate of ghosts and gods are the people who do not do well. What is the fate of this ghost? Isn’t it worse than people? Hahahaha...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black magical atmosphere of the Lich’s body has been fierce like a spray The volcano in the middle is not just that she even looked at the Marquis with some weird eyes. According to this past performance, his current appearance is not so much drunk as it is crazy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that I finally laughed enough because Hamm stopped and took a breath and said with a awake tone: "Well, the old man of Sandu, you have to go." Let's go. I will help you stop her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very easy statement but the reflections of Sandru and Vedina More surprised than watching his laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I probably understand what you are going to do. Things have reached this point, maybe it’s useless, but it’s useless, it’s one thing, it’s not done, it’s Another thing." Because the drunkenness in Ham's eyes is dissipating or he is not drunk, he is just out of control. There was still a drunken smile on his face that waved at Sandro. "She hasn't shot me before, but she doesn't know how to kill me and doesn't let you run away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most annoying thing in my life is that others are self-righteous. To sell people to me is especially a guy you hate. If you usually cut down your self-righteous dog head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha ha ha ha..." The huge laughter of the ghost crying and wandering filled the entire valley from the huge black air that wandered from Vedina's dry body. "No. I decided to replace the King of the Necromancers now to bring you two people who have lost the identity of the Necromancer..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forcing with magic power The voice is still coming out of the broken throat but the head of the lich has already flown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as she laughed loudly, a black flash flashed across her neck from her dry head and flew up in the air, tumbling in the air and then falling to the ground. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru and Marquis are both looking at each other. The most fascinating thing to watch is that Vidnina looks at her headless body and is still laughing. Even her hands can be lifted up under her own will to make a magical gesture. The flames in her eyes seem to be Stayed solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people have not yet reflected that this black flash has begun to flash wildly on the headless body of the Lich. It seems that this slamming blow is not enough. It is just an insignificant beginning. It is invisible to the naked eye. It is on the body of the lich. It is like a broken bamboo. It is just the body of the most famous magic masterpiece that is known by its own master. It became a pile of garbage-like pieces scattered down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru and Marquis have not yet responded. It’s really shocking to see this monster, which is even out of the air, suddenly being split into pieces. What's more, they are not just pure hostility to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure appeared at this time from the darkness behind Vadina. The thin body was originally the face of the old man, but now it is all kind of savage and sour. She seems to have been there all the time, but only three people are not aware of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's you." Sandru is stunned. It is only the king of this killer that can break Vide Nina into pieces in this blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agrireel holds only a handful of rock fragments in her hand. She used this thing to cut the Lich alive. She is now throwing away rock fragments and letting go. Both Sandro and the Marquis had just opened their mouths and had no time to make a sound. The sorcerer’s head on the ground was also smashed into pieces of land and the fire of the soul in the hoe was also gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t die any more. Let's get started." Ai Greiner looked at Sandro with a cold eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Sandro looked at the debris of the land and stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no life box in the body. It seems that she has been able to place the life box somewhere else like the legendary lich. So she can't die. And The smell of the black star in the Deya Valley is too strong. She can't be too troublesome to resurrect." Ai Greiner's face is not easy to look at the pieces of the land and still has a faint killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The right thing to say." The voice of the Lich re-emerged. Her body was scattered into pieces of the earth. This sound came from the magical atmosphere that pervaded the entire valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the sound appeared, Ai's body had disappeared as if she were originally a virtual image drawn with illusion. At the same time, dozens of green flames condensed out of the flamingo appeared in the space around the tens of meters of space, fanning the wings and flying in this space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface of the obsidian has melted all of these flamingos into a huge space of burning. Both the Sandr and the Marquis on the edge of the retreat can only be riddled with embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sigh of relief from the edge of this green fire purgatory came a black shadow that was hidden in the crack of space and was burned out by this flame. With a trace of burnt smell, this figure flicked in the green fire and flew out of the flame range and disappeared completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's amazing. Although it's the same as the Necromancer, but can break through my body so many magical barriers, I can still do my best. The escape from the flames of hell is the killer in the hands of the killers. It’s not unreasonable for so many people in the guild to be so jealous for so many years.” Vidnina’s voice continued to float in the empty valley, and the fragments fluttered on the ground. It was only a few blinks that it re-aggregated a lich and even the tattered robes on her body were intact. "If it weren't in this present Deva Valley where I was filled with the breath of the sacred Dark Star, I really couldn't recover and fight back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
