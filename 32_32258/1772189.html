			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the heat wave filling the air, it seems that there is nothing like the corpse smelling in the huge fireball, like the color on the body. Understand that the magic contained in this fireball is not just a simple fire magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the Devil's Crystal Arrow and the Cardinal's White Magic, the magic of the horror of the horror can be solved. But this timing is just when Wellske and Adela have just shot. Although this fireball is not as fast as a magical arrow, it will never let them have the next magic and crystal arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This huge scattered body smoldering fireball is still directed at Bishop Adela. Others may be able to escape and he wants to hide and not have that ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Adela and Wellske can’t get a shot, but there’s still a Christine who’s screaming at the iron sword The fireball is on the way. No matter how big and different the fireball is, it is just a primary spell. At most, it is the explosive power, and there is something like a toxin. As long as you cut the magical fluctuations from it, even the high-level magic of thunderous bombs will collapse. All that remains is just two flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shovel giant sword turned into a silver fierce rushing toward the fireball. This sword is condensed with raging white magic to deal with this obviously magic with darkness and necromantic system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the silver sword has not touched the fireball fireball and suddenly spreads it apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not because this sword is too powerful, but because the person who made the fireball is behind another smaller and faster The fireball hit the front of this. So the blue-green that was originally condensed was suddenly dispersed. Turned into a vast blue-green fire rain to Christine and the templars behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original fireball contains a lot of explosive power. This is really just a ball of fire, so it’s not a splash but it continues to do. The fire that was flying in the air flew toward the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s just a normal smoldering fire, it’s just a hot breeze for the Knights Templar and the Templar, but this magical flame of different colors is different. When it comes to the fact that Christine's Iron Sword can cut the magic but can't block the magic. Although he could not dodge, he also pulled back his hands in front of his eyes when he was in the first place. It was like a large basin of water-like magical flame that hit the face and hit him all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue-green flame burns only a slight sizzle on the Glorious Battlegear disappears in the white light but the chain gloves and steel boots are here. Under the flame, the ice was eroded as quickly as the ice was poured. The flame that fell on his bare skin immediately became strong. It seems to be falling on a pile of oil and burning like a happy and exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christine’s screaming screaming voice, no matter who listens, will not be considered to be from the mouth of the noble, mighty and mighty knight. The air is burnt with the smell of meat and it is still the kind of rotten smelly meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Knights of the Temple, after all, the Knights of the Temple are almost burned, and Christine is enough to condense the magical power in the pain similar to the shower. I immediately used purifying and healing for myself. The strange flame that had just burned a bit on his face immediately subsided, but it was a piece of charcoal-like trace of burnt skin that burned for half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christine snorted and sat down on the floor. The appearance of the injury is horrible but not serious. It’s just that his white magic is not enough to purify and can't completely dispel the magical power in the flame. Now his condition is like pouring a bucket of oil on the wall. Although it was probably wiped clean, the things that penetrated into it were still there and more and more infiltrated into deeper places. The corrosive magic toxin declares that part of the body begins to wither failure every time. If it is not the body's vindictiveness and white magic can still play a depressing role, I am afraid that he is now a zombie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond Christine’s blue-green fire and rain, spread out to a section 20 meters away, covering Adela Wilson and all the templars . The hot, rancid breath immediately turned into a huge oven that was baking a dead mouse in the gutter within 20 meters. Everyone can feel that their lungs seem to be perforating the skin under the corrosion of this gas. But no sacred warrior hides because the center of the oven is the cardinal adult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asa leg that fired the ball was almost soft and sat on the ground. The next three Hiltons were temporarily lost because of the surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fireball with the variation of Necromancer magic draws all the magic in his body. Almost even the body is out of control. Necromancer magic is subtle but facing the shrine knight who is holding white magic all over the body. There is also a more profound and deeper cardinal that the Necromancer knows more than he knows. With his control skills that are not much higher than the apprenticeship, the magic may not be solved yet. It is. So he simply used such a simple and direct method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simplest and most direct way to use it at the right time is often the most practical and effective. The power of the Necromancer in this fireball is just like a big flame. It can kill a cow. Even the white magic of the Templars and the Templars has a certain restraining effect on this. But it is after all. The flames of all magical spirits are like Christine. Even if you are burnt, you will never just peel off the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wellske’s big drink finally propped up his sacred guard at this time. A white light shield appeared on his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this light shield can only hold up to one meter square in his hand and just cover him and Adela. The sacred warriors who protected Adra also fell within the protection of the Divine Guardian Shield. But beyond that. The templars around them were exposed to this strange flame of rain and even included Talis, whose hand had been scrapped because of the arrow of Gru. Although they can all use white magic, this overwhelming death magical flame is obviously not resistant to the white magic of the bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The glory of the Lord gives me the power and courage to break the evil spirits." A big drink, a figure does not flash, but does not hide, but also meets the blue-green sea of ​​death. Rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Javier Samurai." Talis and several templars were exclaimed. The figure that flies up is the young templar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Javey’s drink, there was a strong white glow around his body. This ray was almost as strong as drowning in his own body, just like the earth-shattering purification used by Adela when he first entered the forest. At this moment he almost became the sun that fell on the mortal world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white light flies around his figure and then the blue-green flame that dies on the face like the sun’s white mans together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no earth-shattering crash, but everyone can feel the strange waves that are different from each other and seemingly equal in magical force and then eroded each other and melted each other. . The blue-green fire and the white light dissipate in the air with the same degree of flying. Only a small amount of blue-green squirting continues to fly back. But it has not caused much damage to the Templars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white ray disappeared and the young Templar landed a cockroach and barely stood still. The magical leather armor on his body has been riddled with holes like a piece of clothing and head that has just been pulled out of the stove. There are also many places where there are signs of burning, but his body is not damaged. In addition to a tired face and awkward steps, this is also a phenomenon of excessive consumption of magical power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Templars cheered and amazed. Even Wellskey’s eyes on the Javier were all unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa was equally surprised to see the templar who dispelled his own fireball. It happened that the Templar also looked at him. Asa involuntarily licked this strange face that should be the first time to meet, but let him have a strange feeling that the blue scorpion seems to bring a strange familiarity in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the surprise of the cardinal's face is amazed by the fact that this surprise has delayed a little bit of time. Christine, who barely flew back, could not support it. One fell to the ground. Adela quickly used white magic to help him treat detoxification. And with the command of Wellske, all the templars were rushed to the front and rushed forward. Anyone who can see that this fireball has been exhausted is now a good opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The templars flying over are a little slower because they have to circumvent the expanding battlefield. Not only do they even try to stay away from Asa and Cedros. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
