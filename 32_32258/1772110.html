			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small, very old chapel in the corner of the School of Magic. It’s a long-lost old building that almost no one comes here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old pastor hurriedly walked around and looked inside and immediately walked in.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Is it a bit too much for the priests?" The old pastor who had spent the year had found the person he was looking for and asked carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not too much. I just want to be quiet." Asa sighed and couldn't think of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you have to change at least one place." The elderly are always more particular about the details and rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to have a good atmosphere here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Financial Assistant Minister is looking for you "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Assistant Minister? Don't know. What did he do for me? Just ask me and ask him to come."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old baker's face with white brows and beard and wrinkles helplessly squeezed for a while and looked at the young superior in front of him to understand what was useless, but turned and shook his head and went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa struggled to change his posture. He was not comfortable. He couldn’t do it. The carpenters made this thing to place the holy book and the bishop. Hand instead of placing the ass. The murals around the murals and reliefs are each in their own positions. Some of them are squinting and glaring, and they stare softly at the person who should serve them and sit on the platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a familiar footstep, the doorstep of the cathedral rang from the door of the cathedral and did not look back. He only sighed and said: "Is it yours?" I thought who it was."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although this chapel is no longer useful, is it too much for you to sit on the platform?" The minister’s steady and solemn voice said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled and replied: "Where can be too much. Just a pious old clergyman just said that I am 'a bit too much'." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The old pastor didn't let me in, but I insisted on coming to him and said to me, please don't be surprised because you have always been like this." Assistant Minister The voice has a smile. "It seems that you often do this kind of thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you do? I don’t think I have anything to do. But just drink. It’s hard to eat some meat last time. A monocular lizard has been baked in the grass outside and it has been reprimanded by the bishop for a while.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh? Is that a monocular lizard called 'Southern Glass Beads'? I remember you always said that you want to taste what it tastes." Because the memory of the previous Assistant Secretary of the Memory was a bit lively. "The bishop is reprimanding you shouldn't kill you in a hurry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed and said, "I won’t be roasting lizards here when it’s raining outside. Grab the book and use it as a fuel to know which one is actually a solitary classic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, you still haven't changed."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have changed your voice as if it is more sophisticated than before. It is worthy of being the only female minister of the empire of the Financial Assistant Minister."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it? I also feel a little bit." The assistant minister said a little self-deprecatingly. "Probably because of the old age."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa turned around and still saw the slightly slender and delicate face above the slender The eyes are straight and the thin lips are thin, but the memory of the green and the flamboyant and lively temperament is no longer replaced by the maturity and self-contained and the uniformed uniforms actually have some dignity in the beautiful and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No old. It is mature and beautiful." Asa smiled at her and looked at her face and temperament that she had never seen before. Give birth to some strange feelings. This feeling was also seen when I met Rod Hart. He sighed and said: "I am now as if a person has become an official or has a career, he will soon become a mature and mature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But why am I the same?" Asa sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be that your character is not suitable for doing these things." Xiao Xiao smiled. "In fact, even I don't believe that you can become a priest and a great hero in the future. You....you are not like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. I don't It is suitable. I am only now present yesterday. It is really not suitable for me.” Asa sighed for a long time and squeezed all the air in the lungs with feelings of depression and helplessness. "I would rather live alone in the swamp in the desert to face the beasts and monsters. I am not willing to stay here again. I am too benzene. Too stupid. I can't see anything about people and things around me. Even if I want to work hard to do something, I can't control anything. So I am annoyed to be alone in this place. Then I think...." He said that he did not continue to talk about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The eager eagle can't live in the sea." Xiao Yan's voice was soft and silky. "You are not stupid. Probably not suitable for such an environment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentleness in this tone is just a little but the feeling of emptiness and helplessness has a full feeling. Suddenly, those things that have long been forgotten for a long time have jumped out. Asa silently asked, "Do you remember what I told you before? I want to travel around the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember that you used to I talked about it." It was mentioned that the sound of Xiaoxiao was softer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked at the thin eyes and smiled as if it were not as pure as before, but the gentleness of the silk still took him like that. Every gap in your heart is filled. He thought about it and said, "...In fact, I had a question in the past who wanted to ask you but never asked..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What problem?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to travel freely. Are you willing to go with me?" After asking this sentence, Asa turned his head and looked at the dusty one. God does not dare to look at her again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no answers, only the two people's breathing alternates in this old chapel. This dusty place is full of traces of history as if time can easily be recalled by memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you still want to travel now? What do the bishops arrange for you?" Xiao Xiao’s voice returned to maturity. "Although you are not used to such an environment yet, it is useless to face the responsibility of the responsibility. It should be useless to escape." She paused her voice more smoothly but seemed to be a bit lonely. "We have all grown up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two fell silent into each other. After a while, Asa asked: "What are you doing to come to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small handed out a letter and handed it to him. "This is what my sister entrusted me to hand you over and then hand you over to your friend Rod Hart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't she go by myself? I want you Transfer it to me and transfer it again? Is it fun?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably sorry. The letter may be something that is difficult to open. It won't be so strong." Xiao Yu's tone is actually the taste of people coming over. "The minds of girls are so unpredictable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa reached out and took the letter and shook his head: "It’s really unpredictable. ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay. My mission is complete. There are still a lot of business waiting for me. You still have to work hard to do your business." The assistant minister turned and went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the door of the School of Magic, she came back and looked at the dilapidated chapel and sighed: "Why didn't you ask me at the time..." Wiping her eyes, she slowly boarded the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try to do my thing? Do you know what I want to do?" Asa also sighed in the chapel. His hand took the scroll in his arms and looked slowly in his hand. The little ones at the ends of the reel gave off a slight glow. As long as you grasp these two little things, all the annoyances in this world will no longer be related to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, I went to Airy to suppress the troops of the infidels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked at the mighty troops frowning and asked Rod Hart: "Do you use so many people?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt rides a white-haired head and a silver-colored knight's armor. The purple cloak looks exactly like his commander's identity. Weifeng and Asa walked side by side at the forefront of the team. He shook his head and said, "There are not more than 5,000 people. I am familiar with the situation of Ali, and I will never lose money. According to the report, the pagan group probably It’s almost five or six thousand, but it’s all without the formal equipment. It’s okay to deal with it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa took the letter from her arms give him. "This is Krys asking her sister to hand it over to me and let me pass it on to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt frowned and took the letter to open . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What was written above?" Asked Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing. She told me that the emperor had already brought a kiss to the Duke." Rodhart replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Asa was a little surprised and looked at Rodhart’s calm expression. "As if you have known it for a long time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." Rodha features head. "When I heard that Cris mentions her and the emperor, she probably didn't realize that I had already realized that I would definitely show it to this day. But because of the impact of the last hunting event, it was better than me. I want to be quicker."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You and Chris....should always be....a good relationship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course." Rodhart nodded. "The Duke of Mulak sometimes intends to arrange that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa remembered the judgment of the great and very good Bolugan. For a talent like Rod Hart, Klee is the Duke’s guarantee that he will receive the important chips he has left. But now this chip is obviously more useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't the Duke know that the emperor likes Chris?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He didn't know. This incident is actually very secret, except that I and Clys and the emperor themselves do not know. The Duke adults pay too much attention to the national political affairs and naturally do not care about the details of these children."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you didn't tell the Duke this news?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because there is no need to let him know." Dehart smiled as if it was a smile. It seems that sneer is a bit unpredictable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa frowning asks: "Only the letter only wrote this?" If it is only these words, it seems that there is no need to specifically call two people to transfer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt’s expression is slightly unnatural and faint: “She also said she was confused and didn’t know what to do. Today at noon she will be at us often I am waiting for me in the tavern. If I go, I will leave the king with me." His tone is very plain and simple, and it seems that it is not very important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled a bit. Another marriage like this is another elopement in the womb. But Rod Hart looked like he was surprised at the time, and he did not have much effort to decide what to do. She was waiting for him there, but he was already busy with his own tasks, and he gave up and left without a trace of muddy water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looks at Rod Hart. The line of his face is not very clear. It is a kind of handsome and intimate soft feeling that was originally associated with the temperament of fortitude and bravery, but the calmness and reason that are the same all the time are already out. The strength that any courage can represent. This is the one who is intimately integrated with this environment. He will eventually become the real powerhouse in this environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these are no longer their own business. Asa touched his waist and hard through the clothes, he could feel the magical power flowing on the scroll. It was the taste of freedom and giving up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
