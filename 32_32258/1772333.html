			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, why did he go that way? What did he do with the hilt to Morrison? A good road is Akibad’s intention to leave to the acting president who practiced real meditation. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, I don't bother to guess, I only know that the person who raised the dark star has really appeared, and our road has finally come to an end." . This is the fate of those who are above our guardian destiny. We can only watch, wait, and accept the fate. Shante replied faintly, the voice is still dry, no joy and no worries. "So I just want to come here to see." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephen didn't talk. The two necromancers stared at the dark star on the altar. The hurricane was still fierce, and the two old men were like two. The statue stands on the top of the dead mountain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer established it for Ajibad to protect this, he also relies on this The spirit of the artifact created the Necromancer: the Necromancer, the Necromancer, and the Necromancer, because this sword will exist.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What is the real thing that Mr. Akibad said is... an irresistible fate? "I don't know how long it took, Stephen said.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no wrinkle in the eyebrows of Shante, and he has been staring at the star of the dark star. Stephen glanced, faintly said: "You should not be the kind of clown that Aiden and Nimbas do not know how to advance and retreat, and should not have the kind of impulsive personality of Sandro. Can't you even face the fate? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't dare to face it. At our age and level, what else is not going to face..." Stephen said faintly. Just staying for a short while, his eyes are still clear and flexible.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Just doubt. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doubt? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephen did not answer. Deva Valley was established by him, and Necromancer was invented by this magical genius. Everything of the Necromancer was created by him. Necromancer suspected Akibad. It seems incredible that the people in the church are skeptical of the Lord in heaven. But believers are not necessarily pious, and sincereness is not necessarily sincere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sand understands that the Necromancer is clear and high, but their minds are not easily paralyzed by any beliefs or prophecies. He said slowly: "Even if you are suspicious, it doesn't work. When he picks up the hilt and the breath of the ground, the breath that comes out of his body has resonated with the mark of the amount of darkness in my body. I can hardly help but kneel down to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I realized at that time, as long as he really raised the dark star, whether we wish Unwilling, the brand of the dark star left in the body will let us automatically surrender to him, just like the fear knight I made will be controlled by my mind. When I become the necromancer to accept the brand of the dark star, get When we lived in the Shadow Mountain Range and the Deva Valley, we actually accepted our own destiny. This is a fact, you don't have to doubt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turned out to be the case... It turns out that this surrender is not an advisory or a stipulation. It is an irresistible fact." Stephen smiled bitterly, but then shook his head and continued. "But I am not skeptical about this. I suspect that Akibad is an adult. Maybe not everything is expected by the adults of Akibad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh? How?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least from the road that was originally taken by the acting president, he was taken by the kid. Akibad The adult did not expect this. Or, he may not have expected the appearance of this kid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sant silent for a while, nodded: "Akibad Adults are just people, not gods. He has no reason to anticipate everything after five hundred years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it’s just this unexpected kid picking up The Dark Star... Going on the road that was not prepared for him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sant did not speak or show anything, listening quietly to Stephen’s words . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The most important thing is that I really don't understand what Akibad is going to want. He left the real meditation, the gown of the Ghost King, It is also predicted that the person who pulls up the Dark Star will become the king of the Necromancer... but he never seems to have told the Necromancer to pull up the Dark Star."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The teacher you guarded the channel, Moriel, there is not only that road to see the Black Dragon, almost every generation of the guild president will check the seal. Why the agent who practiced into real meditation can but You can take that road"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sand looked at him and said faintly: "I don't think you are a restless guy. Do you think it makes sense?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just curiosity." Stephen smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I went to the Far East, I found something strange in your mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Stephan still smiles and doesn't talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no need to be curious soon. The kid should have arrived at Moriel. The event will happen after all, and we just have to watch it quietly." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... maybe." Stephen nodded and looked at the black body that stood tall and did not speak. After a long while, he turned and went to the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steps of countless obsidian are like a slender line that stretches from the top of the mountain to the foot of the mountain on a huge mountain. Stephen’s pace is very big, very soon. It became an inconspicuous little point on this thin line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The president of the Necromancer Association broke the handle of the Dark Star? You can also direct you to give me the handle of the Dark Star. What happened to Akibad’s disciples? The five hundred years did not seem to be long. Only the most intelligent and talented people could enter the Necromancer Association, and he said that he would keep a clear and far-reaching Necromancer. We, what's wrong with this? Even the hilt is falling into the hands of other people. It's a shame."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mollier looks at Asa, smiles like a The adult who saw the ignorant thing did the same thing as an adult. Her smile was as bright as a hundred-headed elephant, and Asa could hardly hold her ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only feels dizzy, not just this huge laugh. Moriel's reaction, the reason for the laughter, the discourse, and the fact that he was already in the fog, he was in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dragon's nature is still the enemy of Akibad's seal, so I will definitely accept the dark star. They think so? In the end, they understand that Something, or do I understand it? What do they know between Akibad and me? They know him as an unattainable god. Why can’t he think he will play tricks?” Morial’s The smile began to show the smell of ridicule, and the grotesque face of the singularity came to the front of Asa and asked in a word. "You, do you know how many of them? The great young man who wants to save the world from quelling disputes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa didn't speak, he didn't know what to say, He doesn't even know what he should think about. He felt that his head was not much better than a paste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai’s mother didn’t lie to herself, but she’s wrong, although she still doesn’t know what’s going on here, but already knows that Morrier is here. Not the end point that he expected to solve everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end-to-end efforts and expectations are not a bubble, even the anger of Lancelot when he took the hilt now looks like a puppet show ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Interesting humans, it’s so interesting. Self-righteous little reptiles..." Moriel is still laughing, the huge sounds from the petite body It blew out like a raging wave, hitting Asa’s ear, rushing into his heart and hitting the psychological defense that he had been suppressing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at your mother, shut up." Asa slammed. His eyes were red, staring at the red-haired woman in front of him. Extreme disappointment, confusion, and the feeling of being fooled and despised is like a pot of oil burning on his anger that has been suppressed, and finally broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mollier really stopped talking, her laughter stopped, looked at Asa, one word and one word: "I can’t stop you, how can you?" "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asam silently, he really can't be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be able to come here to show that you are not too stupid, you should be able to understand that it is useless to kill you, it does not mean you can't kill you." Moriel’s body is still not murderous, the same as when killing the Tauren. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
