			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bonfire is very red, and there are still buzzing sounds from time to time. Like everyone's interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This transaction has a lot of art and other special hand prices higher than expected and then slaughtered a dwarf businessman at a very low price Purchased a lot of sophisticated weapons. Others have also found a lot of the best wood in the southeast of Ian Fast. This kind of wood products are very popular in the 6 aristocratic society of the West. The key is to hear that an unprecedented level of pagan turmoil has completely destroyed the forest that produced this wood. This is the last batch of goods. The value of these woods can be hard to estimate. Although they already have mercenaries, but because the goods are too expensive, Oufu also sent three werewolves and a Kodo to help carry and escort their caravan. There are a lot of big ear monsters who can't stand the system of Oufu and declare that they have left the old line of robbers in the wild land. Oufu's manpower is not enough to maintain the security of the entire highland and considers that the emotions of the big-eared monsters who joined Oufu are not good for their massacre slaughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But once the team has three werewolves, this worries are completely gone. Since the departure of Oufu, merchants have been very happy. Almost every night in the camp in the wasteland has become the source of meat for the three werewolves in the campfire party. Now that it has reached the edge of the wild land, it will take two days to return to Elazia. So this evening, the merchants took out the treasured wine and invited the mercenaries to drink together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the three werewolves in the team still refused to drink. Oufu has regulations that do not allow orcs to get this exciting drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But other people are different. The wine and meat have brought the interest to the extreme. The laughter, the chatter, the snoring and the shouting are intertwined to make this deadly wild woodland lively and extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most words in the role of alcohol must be mercenaries. And there are quite a few topics for them to talk about. There are so many major things in the middle of the year. The nature that best evokes people to talk and delusion is the wanted criminal. The five thousand gold coins have enough charm to make him hang on his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I have the guy’s whereabouts, I’m sure I won’t say it. I’m going to get close to him. I’m going to be a very honest and friendly person to get close to him. Let him have a good impression on me and then he will be relieved." A mercenary who is more ugly than the Orcs, who is more ugly than the ogre, digs his nose and talks about his hunting. "You must know that this kind of person who is in flight must be very lonely in the heart. So as long as you touch his heart, he will treat you as a friend. Hehe~~" He blew a wine cellar The empty hand is facing forward with the posture of holding the knife. "I can give him a knife and then I can hahahaha.... Abin, are you not trying to put Karen's steel repairing sword? I will give you ten. Haha. Ai Meimei Big Brother, once I have the Tower of Money, the few magical wizards throw a gold coin and throw it over... You see they dare to drop you out of school. I can also learn what to do with the magic..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha, this guy is in love again." The mercenary companions next to the campfire and the merchants laughed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A warrior smiled and shouted: "Hey, I remember when you were 18 years old, you said that you would go to Nigan to kill the dragon and then go to the age of 30. I plan to go to Mount Sandefes to open a magic jade mine forty-five years this year. I have come up with the idea of ​​this wanted man. The plan is getting more and more petty and *** is getting more and more good. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. It is getting more and more promising. Because he is getting more and more down to earth. I can plan to take it when he is 80 years old. Queen Catherine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ha ha ha simply think of a way to be a cardinal. That's still practical."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dahan blushes in the laughter of everyone: "Do you think I brag? I already have detailed plans and steps. If you don't believe me, I will tell you...."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough, there is progress to grow. After returning to Erasia, I will go to the cathedral to apply. Not simply tomorrow we will divert to Celeste." It’s a big laugh. Even the three werewolves showed a smile. Although they may not understand the ridiculous aspects of the language, they feel very clear about the lively and friendly atmosphere in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A handsome young man with a red headscarf sitting on the head next to the big man patted his back: "You want to help me buy the sword, I will take it for you." Regardless of your character, you don’t dare to dismiss you in front of you with your looks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dahan seems to want to argue for his ambitions, but looking at the laughter of everyone seems to only add some more jokes. Then the heart was reluctant to sit down in anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man continued to pat the big man’s back and said: "Even if you step on the dog, you can really see the person and then the dog will step on it." You and he have no war to you and show you the back, but can you kill him like that? But it was assassinated by Bishop Ronis and the Duke of Mulak and then broke out in the tens of thousands of guards. Guys. And it’s also a spit of magical magic that can turn you into a zombie.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cut. What a dead magic. That guy is a dead spirit. The name of the guild to swindle and swindle is not to be afraid." Dahan angered and pulled out a nose and said. "The Necromancers are all releasing words. Can those guys still lie? Even the old guys in our guild have been dispatched for this. The guy is not dead."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while ago, the thieves’ guild adventurer’s guild and the tower of the teeth, the six largest organizations, received a letter from the gold foil for the platinum letter. Also inlaid with a little magic amethyst 骷髅. The content of the letter means that the criminal who was wanted by the whole six had no relationship with the Necromancer. And because this person's mischief is the name of the extremely defeated necrotic guild that can catch this person or the person who is now the person can get the thanks from Deva Valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time that Deya Valley has publicly revealed its meaning to the outside world for so many years, of course, causing great shock. I am sure that this news is by no means a mischief of others. The reason is not just the luxury and exquisiteness of the letter itself. What is more crucial is the way the letter appears. The leaders of the guilds and organizations were thousands of miles away from each other in the Big Six, but they all saw an owl in the middle of the same day and the announcement came to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the reward of the Einfast Empire has ignited a fire, the announcement of the Deva Valley is a large barrel of oil. Can not help but eliminate the people who originally suspected that this wanted person may be the flute of Deya Valley more irritating a large number of people who did not really value gold coins. The Necromancer is not just a synonym for horror and evil. The mysterious and horrible veil is definitely an unimaginable magic item. The legendary scroll may have the secret of dark magic and necrotic magic. Those who dream of joining the 6 most mysterious organizations are not the only ones. Unfortunately, the disloyalty of Deva Valley to visitors is as loud and sinister as the reputation. But now it is open to the outside world to provide a way to touch it. Like a shadow hidden under the dangerous black gauze, a jealous arm of a jade finger suddenly protrudes for those who walk in the darkness and also have the darkness itself. For those who are interested, all the leaks and blood are boiling under this notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a more subtle place that these mercenaries know but don’t notice too much. That is to say that His Majesty the Pope also received such a letter. Although there is no such statement on the church side, many times it is not a statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that the two-legged dragon that was sitting in the King of the Einfast Empire was taken from the sky to save him. The lover at the time..." The magician girl Ai Meimei looked at the bonfire and tried to imagine the expression on the face of the scene at the time. "This is simply a story like a legend...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This beautiful lady asks you to calm down. Please remember that it is not a fairy tale protagonist, not a white horse. The prince. The person he saved was originally a bait. The princess was trying to catch the wanted man before he was guilty of a snake." The young man in the headscarf patted his sister’s head and raised his chest with a smile. The cross that was worn was actually a magical accessory worn by the clergy of the church. "Lord. Please forgive the noble lady. It is a sublime sacrifice to sacrifice the body for justice. I heard that the princess is really beautiful..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenary is shouting: "This little guy is in the spring. Go back to Elazia and ask you to open it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Calling the Lord Be sure to be pious when you are." An old man in the business took the shouting man and looked at the young man with a serious look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Grandpa Relais." Young Yabin smiled and nodded and lowered the cross. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man sighed. He wanted to train this child into a samurai from an early age, but it seems that his character does not seem to be cultivated. My sister Ai Meimei also managed to send her to the Tooth Tower of Dongda 6 to learn magic. But some time ago, she felt that the other person had pity and ran away a prisoner and was sent back. If you can get a senior magician certificate and go to the monastery a few years later, you may be able to go to Celeste for further study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin looked at the three werewolves across the street and asked, "Have you seen the guy himself? I heard that the peace treaty between you, Oufu and Ian Fast seems to be the person who represented the emperor at the School of Magic. Sign it." He is already going to Oufu for the third time and is used to getting along with these furry giant orcs. He didn't care too much about the old-fashioned pasts before his birth. From the personal feelings, these werewolves were also very good at getting along with even a little mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I haven't seen it." The three werewolves shook their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin also shook his head and sighed and said: "It’s really good to say that this guy is in Einfast. If you have a little patience, after Bishop Rooney retires. Maybe I can mix it with a cardinal position. I don't know what the guy thinks in his head." He simply walked over to the werewolf and sat down and asked, "The man can actually steal a pair under your nose. Is the Flying Dragon a bit too powerful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two-legged dragon....is a half-beast...people and lizards...we are raising us....no Know." The werewolf stuttered and replied. Their mouths say that human language is a bit embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the Lord bless you to cure the stuttering problem. Hehe." Yabin smiled and raised a cross to a werewolf. The werewolf snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man of Relais looked at Abin with a black face and said, "The Lord said. Besides me, there must be no other gods. So it is not the people of God who are heretics." These barbaric orcs can never be converted to the glory of God. You are too careless to do so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it has been so many years The merchant but the devout faith of the old man of Relas is not even dyed by money. The occasional suddenness of such a sudden often makes the companions feel that they are not quite right. In particular, in the previous month, His Majesty the Pope suddenly began to express dissatisfaction with the city of Oufu, which is clearly unable to have a foothold in the church. Those who are barbaric beasts and the people's churches of God are flat on the ground. Merchants don't care much about these. After all, the golden coins are not the words of the Pope that God has given them. They are just verbal talks. But the old man of Relas is deeply impressed by the sacred words of the Pope. If it wasn't for him, he was a member of the Chamber of Commerce. He was determined not to go to this barbaric and dirty city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord said that all beings are equal." Abin looked at him and smiled. Relais old man sighed and shook his head. Abin took a picture of the Werewolf's generous hairy back and said, "Please don't mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister Ai Mei also came over and said to the werewolf: "My grandfather actually It’s a very good person. You know it when you get along with him for a long time.” Although she was the first time she came to Oufu to see these huge orcs, she didn’t feel terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The old man is passing too much." Someone in the merchant smiled. It is a shame for the pastor to be expelled from the church, so the old man of Relas did not tell anyone about his past experiences. In the Chamber of Commerce, it seems that he is just an ordinary old man who believes in piety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The werewolf showed a smile that might be a friendly smile, but the fangs that appeared at the mouth were a bit embarrassing. "It doesn't matter. Our city... The Lord said... Everyone has the freedom to speak freely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May the Lord blessing to say this People." Yabin smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time three werewolves suddenly stood up from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The werewolf’s movements are very fast as if they were stabbed in the body. Even the hairs of the body were erected. Three pairs of green eyes glared at the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others are stunned. Looking down the wolf's line of sight to the other side, but in the eyes of the people, there is only a dark bonfire, even if it is in the woods of this wilderness, it only illuminates a small piece. And there is really no sound and strange feeling around. It is close to the border of Elazia and there are three werewolves in the team who should not make up their minds. In this region, there is absolutely no beast that can alert the werewolf.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" Abin asked the werewolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You... didn't hear it? There is something...." The werewolf replied that the three werewolves picked up their weapons. Huge meteor hammers can make any beast and enemy timid under their arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You.... don't move us.... Go and see...." The three werewolves walked toward the dark woods. Their figure quickly disappeared from the flames and disappeared into the darkness. I wonder if the wolf's footsteps are too light as dissolved in the silent darkness of the forest. The three werewolves did not leave any traces and sounds. Disappeared in people's sights and feelings. The forest in the darkness in front seems to be a huge monster that quietly swallows them away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the people around the fire are a bit overwhelmed. Everyone did not talk to each other. The bonfire is still so strong and there is a buzzing explosion from time to time. It’s just that the sound that seems to be still so energetic just now bursts out in silence and it’s a bit strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Call’. Kodo beasted heavily and many people were shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These three guys....no problem?" The screaming man snorted his nostrils. "Is it going to pull the urine together..." Seeing no one cares about him and he screams again. "I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Several mercenary companions looked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think about what they feel that we don't feel we can't feel?" Dahan said with a mysterious smile: "Must be these three guys." I smelled the smell of a female wolf but I was embarrassed to say it before us, so I walked away in this way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to your mother." Someone immediately threw a piece of mud over. Some people laughed. The atmosphere has eased a lot. People in the laughter also think that it is really no big deal. It is the wolf's own nervousness. Maybe it is impossible to come up with a group of monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have recovered again. Only the old man of Relas came over and said softly to Abin: "Do you feel any magical fluctuations?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic Fluctuation? No." Abin stunned. “Do you feel it?” Although the old man of Relas has been out of the church for a long time, the daily prayer and meditation in his room is uninterrupted. Although the people in the Chamber of Commerce did not know, but Abin knew that his cultivation was no less than any pastor of the church, and the meditation of white magic required to be more sensitive to magic fluctuations than any other magical faction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man of Relas swayed his nose and seemed to want to smell something unusual in the air, but he shook his head and frowned and said, "Is it me?" Too sensitive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Ai Meimei, let's put together a water mirror reconnaissance technique?" Abin whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it. Probably my illusion is getting older." The old man Raylas shook his head. He didn't want other people in the chamber to know that he and Yabin would be magical and still white magic. People outside the church use white magic to be a big jealousy in the religious country of Erasia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A subtle sound came and the figure of the three werewolves finally appeared in the scope of the bonfire. Everyone was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha..." The screaming big man laughed and dug his nostrils to the werewolf. "How? You are cool enough..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The werewolf suddenly flew a punch. A fist that was not much smaller than the head of this nonsense, slammed into his face with a muffled sound that shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dahan’s body flew back to the campfire with his head and face, and his fingers dug his nostrils completely dig into his head and the palms were completely broken. Together with the five senses, it became smashed and recessed into the head and an eyeball flew out and hung it on the head. The neck was also torn by this force, at least half the length of the original. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people were completely stunned first. Then there were a few people who drank: "Too much too much. He is just a joke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A screaming wild bloodthirsty call is slamming Starting from the ground. The violent and wild overflows in the screaming sounds give the sense of hearing that even the skin can feel. This sound seems to be not from the vocal cords, but purely the illusion of these animal nature. The silent wilderness woods were filled with this sound. The horses all frightened and struggled to move. Even the Kodo beast, known for its slowness, screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three werewolves are facing up, but the clouds on the edge of the moon high in the sky are faintly covering the light of the sky. The werewolf had to tremble with his body in the hysterical form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
