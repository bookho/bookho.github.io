			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wangdu (上)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the situation in the West because of the war, The calm of Ian Fast is especially valuable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this calmness does not fall from the sky. Since the bishop of Ronis was stabbed, the church has turned its attention to it, thinking that the power vacuum that will be formed here is to recapture this. A great opportunity for the control of a huge empire. But in the end, Ian Fast continued to maintain the attitude of the church, and did not let the messengers sent by Celeste get any desired response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same as the style of Bishop Ronis, the School of Magic is still independent of the Glorious Castle, and Ian Fast is still independent in the east of the mainland. The mighty empire, the war that has been ups and downs in the West has not been able to pull it into it. Therefore, when the Pope's majesty was frustrated for the war on the wild, the Queen of Catherine was forced by the barbarians of Tatalia to the city, Geffenhardt 17 can also be very leisurely hunting and cruising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young emperor did not have the conscious consciousness of being an emperor, so he also enjoyed this leisurely happiness. He knew that all things were in a group of capable The minister can solve it, and he does not need to worry about it. What he does not have to worry about is the loyalty of these ministers, especially the two headed, the head of the Paladin Roland and the young Mullak prime minister. Geffenhardt 17 is grateful to God for giving him such competent and faithful courtiers. Without any extra thoughts and ambitions, he has no doubt that he is the most leisurely and happiest emperor in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is any regret in the emperor, it is that the beautiful queen of the man has not been able to add a prince to him, and it seems to have been a body since this time. Some discomfort, I can't accompany him to the southern parade, I have to stay in the palace to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen is lying on the bed, although her face is pale and her face is sick, but the first beauty of this former king is still so beautiful. She glanced at the porridge in front of her, frowned and shook her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You still have something to eat, I heard the waiter said that you have not entered the grain for two days. These porridges are all swallowed by the tributes of the South China Sea. It’s good for the body to eat.” Rod Hart, sitting next to him, whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The queen frowned and sighed and shook his head and said, "It’s really impossible to eat. If you eat it, you will spit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Is it?" Rodhart took out a small piece of oil paper wrapped in his arms and smiled and held it in his hand. "That this, this is the old man of Yorkburg Starcom in the north." The pastry. I bought it at the door of his house late at night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen’s eyes suddenly brightened from Rod Hart I took a paper bag in my hand and finally had a smile on my face. Although there is still no blood on her face, the smile is still like the spring breeze. She took a slick paper bag and sniffed it on the nose and said, "You still remember that I love this. I haven't smelled it for more than a year. I still remember that when I was young, I used to go shopping with my sister." But she finally regretted and sighed and put the piece of cake down. "Thank you for being so bothered, but I still can't eat it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened? "Rodhart's face is full of concern and gentleness. Although he is now the captain of the first squad of the Paladin, and the prince of the Guards of the Kings, but the face that is very soft and very nice to see people will give you a close look, let him see It is more like a big boy in a neighbor's house. Even the mighty color of the knight's costume is turned into a soft one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am mainly uncomfortable with the stomach, and I can't eat anything." The Queen frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt gently placed his hand on the Queen’s belly and recited the prayer: “May the Lord pity your people...” White The magic light shines on his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No." The Queen suddenly opened his hand in panic, as if his hand was a red-hot soldering iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt looked at her with amazement, and he was definitely not likely to be in touch with his own action. Although she is indeed a queen, he is a courtier. In the eyes of others, this action is absolutely enough to get rid of his head, but he clearly knows that this is nothing to them. He is definitely her closest person, even more intimate than her husband, Her Majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhart said with amazement: "What? How come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. The people present at the time were scared, and they were still anxious to catch I lived in the neck of a pastor. Later, they went back to the medical book and discussed it in a meeting. Only then did I know that I had a very rare tumor disease, and ordinary medical magic was useless."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? What should I do?" Rodhart looked anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, they said that it will take better to calm down." The Queen sighed and said, "It is you, when did you learn magic?" Did your master Roland prepare you to learn?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the teacher has always said that greed is lost, I don't approve of magic. I actually I didn’t want to go to school. I just asked a priest under my curiousness. I thought it would be easy to learn.” Rodhart said to the empress and said with a smile, “I even feel better than learning swords. It’s easy to do more, but I don’t dare tell my master.” He then sighed again: “So I just came back to see you, and I’m going to give you a surprise, I will treat you with your own hands, but I can’t think of it. Use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, nothing. Right, the two pastors said that Celeste seems to be coming to a cardinal. The cardinal came to show me. I heard that the cardinal was the personal appointment of Pope John the Patriarch. To take charge of the School of Magic, I must have extraordinary ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt shook his head and chuckled: "I know this too. Hey, the Pope sent a few The second messenger came back without success. This time, I came directly to a cardinal who wanted to take the magic school to the past. Unfortunately, the bishop’s ability is extraordinary here. What is it here? It’s not Elazia or Sele Stein, actually mastering Einfast, but the head of Roland and your sister, do you say that they will hand over the magic school to the Holy See? My only expectation of the cardinal's ability is hope. He can cure your illness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen thought thoughtfully for a while, then suddenly asked Rodhart: "You...you Are you satisfied with the current situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt smiled and replied: "What do you mean? Is there anything wrong now?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you very comfortable with this courtier?" The Queen looked at Rod Hart deeply. "I am this emperor." Do Debu comfortable "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;".? How do you suddenly talking about these "Rod Hart frowned at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been in a mess for a few days, I really feel like something bad is going to happen, I really don't want to do this queen anymore, Stay here again. Have you thought about it, but we can do it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Other thoughts." Rodhart interrupted the Queen’s words. From her expression, her eyes and her understanding of her, she can fully know what she wants to say next. "You are just ill, and you will be confused if you are in a bad mood. It will be fine to cultivate yourself."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you listen to me. I always feel something is wrong, I can't stay here again..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you talking about? Where can you go anywhere? You are the queen of a country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said really." Queen No more talking, just looking at Rod Hart, that face has not a little bit of the concept of the Queen, all the sorrow and sadness on her pale face Looked helpless, she's shocked to have tears in the flashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt wants to talk, but looking at the face in front of him, he suddenly feels that something in his heart has been shaking for a long time, to The language of the mouth can't be exported. This is not the feelings of impulsive children, he can see a deep despair and fear from those beautiful eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two silently looked at each other and suddenly a voice came to break this stalemate. "Because of the singer, Jia Wei’s cardinal adult has already arrived at the School of Magic. Prime Minister Please ask Lord Rod Hart to meet with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, Chen retired." Rodhart sighed and stood up to the door. Salute, turned and went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cardinal adult is indeed very strange and very eye-catching, but the strangeness itself is very strange, based on his identity and his appearance. Compared with a cardinal, he is too heroic, too powerful, and too young. Even he was not wearing a cardinal robes, but a martyr's white warrior costume, wearing a long sword at his waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two days ago, when Celeste came to the news, everyone was extremely imaginative about the successor to Bishop Roones and was able to be His Majesty the Pope took over the responsibility of taking over the beach, and he must have something extraordinary. But no one even thought that it was such a young man in his twenties. If he was not with him, there was a confidant of the Pope’s confession, Adelaide, even if he was holding him. No one will believe in the personal letter of His Majesty. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After accompanying him, Bishop Adela left the commander and documents of His Majesty the Emperor. The young cardinal was just left alone at the School of Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although full of surprises and doubts, there is still some disdain, but this is indeed the cardinal that the Pope’s personal appointment to take charge of here is no doubt. . Even though no one actually welcomes him here, the form should still be done in no way. All the things are basically ready, so I immediately invited the priests to hold the welcoming ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rodhardt is coming." With the announcement of the pastor, the king was commanded by the Guards, and the first captain of the Paladin appeared. Doorway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just saw the young cardinal sitting above, Rod Hart couldn’t help but smile, but he quickly replied Normally, come forward to salute: "See Bishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The head of Roland accompanied him to the South together. So the Paladin is now temporarily Under the command of Lord Rodhart, Lord Rodhart is a disciple of the late Rand, and is also the leader of the Guards of the Kings. The Paladin is strictly one of the subordinates of the School of Magic, and nominally it should be under the jurisdiction of the successor of Bishop Roones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the famous saying is one thing, in fact, it is naturally another matter, although the cardinal adults seem to be handsome and handsome. But after all, it is too young, it is hard to believe that he has enough qualifications and ability to deal with the magic school. More importantly, no one here hopes that he can handle it well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adults don't have to be polite, after all, I am a guest." The cardinal smiled, his smile was natural, without the slightest tension and creation, as if he It’s really just a guest here. The handsome face is very bright and very affectionate. This is the name of the Paladin. I’ve heard it when I’m in Celeste, and then I’ll see Lord Rodhart. Such a character, then it is even more certain that there is no vain under the prestigious name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt was slightly surprised and a little vigilant. He has not felt this way for a long time. This is the feeling of seeing enough opponents to match yourself, even better than your opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he feels is not the heroic, handsome, and the like of the person’s face, but the hidden things behind the attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is a welcoming ceremony, all the people here are also under the influence of this cardinal, but everyone is also faint to him. Wariness and hostility, waiting for him are also intentional martyrdom and obstacles, and perhaps hostile. But even then, the young man can laugh so freely, so casual, except for those who should be exposed in this occasion, there is no leakage of extra scent, like a blue ocean. The pleasing color is implicitly behind the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mulak Prime Minister is here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming with the new Cardinal is such a big event, naturally Leaders of the three majors need to be taught, the military and political leaders are gathered together. Ryan’s great priest is in the magical school. Rodhart represents the military forces, and the political representative is naturally the prime minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually one of the three representatives, but the reflection of the cardinal when he heard this notice is completely different from that of Rod Hart. . The light in his eyes lit up and stood in the direction of the door. The smile on his face was more lively, more vivid, and more splendid. It was not able to pretend, but the temperature from the heart, like the golden sun. Mild and dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
