			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between elves and humans has long been unfriendly. But this unfriendlyness has always been a bit strange because it seems to be a good way to get along with the elves. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well known that the elves look beautiful, elegant and elegant, and the spirit of simple and kind elves is far more distant than that of human beings. Even the church is not hostile to these pagan races and even In many places, the elves are still highly respected. Except for some arrogance and self-righteousness, of course, this is often a kind of complacency for the culture of their home for thousands of years. They seem to find something that is not easy to get along with. Even because it is amazingly beautiful and handsome in terms of humanity, they should not only be easy to get along with, but also very attractive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But perhaps because it’s so appealing, the relationship with humans is so bad. An elegant and rare female elf seems to be the best value of plaything in the eyes of the elite. It is said that there are also special sluts or female dignitaries who are also very interested in male elves. And since a thing is worth a thousand dollars, it is absolutely impossible to get along well with people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those things that are worth a lot of money are naturally rushing to capture. Therefore, the focus of the elves is not the secret. The elves who are walking in the human society are very rare. It is very rare that there are few human beings who can make friends with the elves. So few people know what scale the elves live in the forests of the Sierra Leone. In addition to the fact that there is indeed a transmission magic circle, there are people who say that there are only a few hundred people in the elf village. Some people say that they are two or three thousand people. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilika and Isis are really trying to develop a very detailed and well-planned plan, but the strategists who are outstanding under such vague information are also It’s not enough. Although Aisisi also asked about it, but did not know why the client who should have enough news did not tell Hu how much forest details. The last few thieves who sent the temptations just grabbed a few female elves in the elf's place of residence and then hugged their heads under the arrow and had no chance to check the details of the elf village. Only a small part of the inside can be drawn according to the memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the female elf captives must be inspected by anyone, but the elf’s stubbornness is also famous, even the torturer of the Shamuhi thieves group. Unsure of what can be asked and that is still a valuable commodity, Helica really can't bear to see that it is almost equivalent to gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Hilika still made a bold and savage plan based on some existing situations. Then, with the three scrolls on hand, there are all the hands that can be gathered to completely occupy the forest in Tula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if Hilica is able to know exactly what is going on in the forests of Tula. He will not have such a plan anyway. The mysterious consignor who gave him three reels never thought about asking him to occupy the entire city of Tula. Because the Tula Leone Forest is the largest elf in the entire Big Six. There is not only an elf village with only a few hundred people, but an elf city with a population of tens of thousands. There are no tall buildings everywhere in the human city. That's because the elves are close to their own culture and architectural style, which will make the thieves who look here a few times have the illusion that the scale is not so big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was actually a crack in the forest's enchantment and was also taken away by a few elves in Tula, this time is also extremely chaotic. The elves have been in peace for hundreds of years. This kind of event suddenly appeared like a peaceful and peaceful girl who was playing in the garden of her own garden, but suddenly the existing people were holding the murder weapon and watching the horror of the elves. The anger is self-evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder elders are not unresponsive. During this time they have secretly sent people to Erasisia to inquire about the whereabouts of the elves who were taken away. The news has already been inquired. The elders immediately began to discuss but the content of the discussion is not limited to this incident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Several compatriots who were arrested based on the information they inquired have been sold as slaves and commodities." An elder elder said with a sullen face. "Those people belong to the largest and most fierce thief gang in Elazi."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can a thief gang use that kind of thing to crack our enchantment? "An elder elder pointed at a bunch of small things on the conference table. It was two pieces of confetti and some ashes." It is the wreckage left after the magic scroll is used. "This kind of magic scroll is superb and incomparable. Since it can break the enchantment, it must use a lot of star fragments. The number of people or organizations that can make such a scroll is very few. How could it be some thieves?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
