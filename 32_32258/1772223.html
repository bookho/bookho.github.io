			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night, this is the fourth night after the appearance of the vampire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past few days, the priests of the School of Magic played the role of the Guards of the Kings. Every night, the kings of the dawn went to inspect and scouted the evil. The Holy Light is visible everywhere, but it is not found any traces of the vampire. There are even rumors that it is actually a murder in the ordinary sense, and the murderer deliberately arranged the scene as such a mere suspicion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This suspicion is not entirely unreasonable, because the vampires who are known for their shackles and secrets seem to have no need to sway in the middle of the capital, near the School of Magic. Foraging. So on the third night, there were not so many patrolling guards and pastors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one noticed that a black figure was flexible in the street, like a clever cat, just right in the fast forward. Dodging past the patrolling pastors and guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn’t take long, this black shadow crossed the huge kingdom and stopped at an uninhabited desert outside the city. With a click, the black shadow fell to the ground and the two shadows overlapped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint moonlight is on the ground. It can be seen that a half-size child is falling on the ground. He is ragged and has a thin face. The big eyes looked at the ground, although it was dirty, but in the moonlight it was possible to tell that his skin all over the body had a nearly transparent white. There are two deep holes in his neck, and a trace of blood flows from the inside and hangs on the pale skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black shadow that left the child’s body quickly digs on the ground with a small shovel. His movements are quick and powerful. Not long after, there was a small pit on the ground. He put the child's body in the pit and covered the soil, then piled up some plants on it. At least on the outside, it doesn't seem to have any obvious signs of obscurity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a distance between Wangdu and the main road. If there is no accident, the body will never be found. And such a wandering boy disappeared in a big city like Wangdu and flashed like a small wave on the sea. No one will pay attention. Such a person disappeared silently from the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of the young corpse is very skilled, it seems that it is not the first time. However, after he had done all this, he did not leave very well, but he looked at his masterpiece in the same place. Slowly, there was a slight convulsion and a crying sound, which was mixed with intermittent sounds: The Almighty Lord... We confess and weep our many sins and evils. These crimes we have committed through thoughts, words and actions from time to time are enough for the Lord to give us condemnation and anger... Please forgive us for relief. Our sin debts are like our forgiveness to those who have lost us, and we are not allowed to fall into temptation. Evil and darkness. All glory belongs to the Lord, from today to forever... ask the Lord for mercy..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a confession. When a believer confesses his sin in the face of the image of God in the church, this person confesses in the wilderness beside his buried body. From this sound is delicate and weak. It can be heard that this is a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crying and convulsions seem to be deliberately suppressed, and finally slammed down and began to vomit. But no matter how hard she did not vomit anything from her throat, she only groaned on the ground in pain. Under the moonlight, you can see that there are the same three inconspicuous mounds around, just like the one that has just buried the juvenile land. She was painfully paralyzed in these mounds, like a prisoner who was suffering from capital punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought you should be used to it." A voice came from behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned like a knife. Under the pale moonlight, the black shadow reveals the glamorous face of the Queen, but now this face has been completely distorted by panic. The pain and wolverines have left too many traces on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also in the pale moonlight, the face of the Red Bishop is still so tough, handsome, and extraordinary, just as brilliant under the sun. He looked at the panicked queen. The smile of the corner of the mouth and the palace of the day did not change at all. I said faintly: "Since you have learned to do it quietly, why are you not used to it? This should be the fourth one you ate..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Bishop Jia Wei only waved his hand gently, and the queen who shot with the arrow immediately bounced back with a ray of light. Her screams seemed so fierce in this wilderness, and the skin that was swept by this holy white magic light burst into a burst of green smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javier Jiawei stepped forward and reached out and pressed the Queen’s body to whisper the mantra. A black mist rolled over the queen’s body, those white The damage caused by magic is immediately restored. He frowned and shook his head and said: "Your strength has just awakened, even this level of white magic can not resist, if your blood is more advanced, I am afraid that even the sun can not stand it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the damage has subsided, but the Queen is still on the ground and seems to have no power to stand up, just staring at the ground and saying: "I am not a monster eating. , I am not a monster to eat people..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In your opinion, is it a monster to eat people?" Bishop Jia Wei looked at the Queen and smiled slightly. . "No, it's food, it's higher than this species. It's like eating chicken and eating pigs. Maybe in their eyes, we are the monsters that eat 'people'. You used to eat chicken for yourself. Going to repent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen earned her, and looked up at the cardinal, although the two teeth were exposed from her lips, but now She was not stunned by tears, but she looked pitiful. She cried to the Cardinal: "I want to be a human, don't do this kind of monster. Why do you harm me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am hurting you?" The bishop shook his head. Reluctantly sighed. "Do you know that if I am not helping you, the half of the vampire kiss in your body may not know when to turn you into a person to bite, even consciousness and thinking are completely crazy under the frantic dark power. The monster? This unfinished ceremonial ceremony only sent the vampire factor a little into your body. It didn't completely change your body, nor gave you enough dark fluctuations. After one year, the origins of those vampires The factors gradually accumulate and develop. But without the dark wave action assistance of the first time, your change is not complete. It is not that I use all the power to help you with Necromancer. You are finished."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen shook her head and shouted: "I don't know, I don't know, I don't know anything. I become like this. I would rather die. I can't stand this kind of uninviting life, daytime. Pretending to be in poor health, come out to eat at night..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that even if the body has surpassed the realm of human beings, there is still no consciousness. Your heart is now Still an ordinary small People. "Jarvis Bishop regret shook his head, then his voice is a cold. "But I hope that you can adapt as soon as possible. I also hope that you don't mess around, you never thought about it, if you expose your identity now. Perhaps the most sad, the most sinful is your sister. Whether psychologically or actually You are already her only relative, almost the only psychological sustenance she has now, and what if other people know that you are a vampire, how would you treat your sister? Although everyone has seen her in the incident against the vampire But I promise that no one will be jealous of your sister because of you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen immediately calmed down after hearing this. Silently worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can rest assured that as long as you listen to me, I promise that you will get used to this body soon, and you can give you a more comfortable lifestyle. Killing people in such a sneaky way. Suffering from your fragile conscience. Blood, you don't have to kill talents to take out. I can teach you how to get this kind of food without hurting people. You don't have to worry about aging and sickness in the future. Your life will not change with the previous place, you can feel confident that your sister's life is very happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen continues to be silent, after a while, Finally, I said, "What do you want me to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Bishop Jia Wei finally showed a smile again. This smile is very warm, very It’s bright and sunny, and I can see that he is really happy. He used the smile that seemed to resolve any hostility and difficulty to say to the Queen: "You can rest assured that it is very simple. You only need your full support to master the Magic Academy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But... I never asked these things, I don’t know how to do them... and these things are decided by His Majesty and the head of Roland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can rest assured, I will tell you how to do it, it is not difficult, and don't bother. As for Geffenhardt's good-hearted emperor and head of Roland..." Bishop Jia Wei is A smile. “Do not worry about us...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a loud female voice came out from the darkness of the night. This voice is not the kind of delicate and sharp of the Queen, but the anger is full of anger: "The git, still not let go? I want to kill you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The strange darkness slowly spread away from the distance between the bishop and the queen. Although this place was originally a shadow of a group of thorns and trees, it was not until this strange darkness slowly disappeared that it was discovered that this place had some light under the moonlight, but the group was not smoke, it seemed pure It is a kind of darkness that devours all the light around it. However, because of the relationship between night and angle, no one will notice what is wrong there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness dissipated, revealing three figures in the middle. The center is the black elf Jessica, who has a long sigh of relief, this darkness is the stunt of the dark elves she issued. What was just yelling was a squadron, tall and arrogant shrine Knight Talis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other one is Asa. He just took his hand back from the knight’s mouth and waist and looked at the horsewoman who jumped and said: “You thought I want to hold you? Do you know what you did when you just rushed out and were discovered by the two? I told you, I am not interested in saving you, I turned around and left me. I will let you be yours. The cardinal adult first murdered and then destroyed the corpse and destroyed the corpse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呸. By your stroking the black elf body stinks your mouth I have to wash with holy water for a week and confess and pray. Oh, Lord of heaven, forgive me. I did not deliberately rely on the evil skill of a black elf to cover my figure, just to understand the truth. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica watched Talis jump out of this dark circle with a cross on her chest. Looking at the side, Chen Sa rolled his eyes and said, "I really think that you shouldn't take her. This kind of idiot should indeed be raped and killed and destroyed. If it wasn't for my deep darkness, it would have arrived. The third order can eliminate some minor noises. The voice of this mother-in-law has already been discovered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed and looked in the direction of Wang Du Frowning thoughts, then asked Talis: "How? You finally believe me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think... I can't think of this guy. The spies from Deya Valley. Unbelievable..." Talis blinked, and the blue veins on her forehead twitched, her expressions intertwined with anger and excitement. "Is it... what you said is true? I... I have to go back to Celeste, I am going to ask the teacher... ask the Pope..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "When you get to this point, what are you going to ask? Looking for death? Lancelot has not said it to you already. Are these things already known to the Pope?" Asa said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these four days, Asa truly fully grasped his own progress in dealing with people in a non-fist manner. The Knights of the Temple seem to have never seen the help of the helpless blessings and the knights who are bound to hold on to their own people. Actually, he was swindled by Asa Lian, and promised not to let their identity leak out to make things big. But she seems to be very confused, and there is nowhere to go, to monitor the fact that Asa does not go to practice the assassination of the plot to live in the same hotel. As a result, a vampire event that shocked Wang Du happened that night. She is even more skeptical about Asa. Although she can't do anything because of her vows, she is almost inseparable from the three-person room. Almost no one can do anything in the past few days, only Asa quietly touched out several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either Jessica or Luya strongly recommend that Asa find a way to get rid of this inconvenient guy or get rid of it, but Asa has never planned to do it. Instead, I kept talking to the horsewoman without saying anything. Talis is almost comparable to the simplicity of the elves in dealing with people's minds, and my heart is confused and depressed. A set of words used by Asa quickly said everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, how can you know this place in advance, as if you know beforehand that this will happen, bring me here and wait?" Talis Suddenly remembered, turned to ask Asa. "If it's not me, I'm absolutely sure that it's really only a vampire. It's really Javie. I really have to wonder if you have arranged for someone to show me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Nature is that I have been scouting for a good time. The key is that I just went to find out that the cardinal also said that I have to close the door to meditate this evening. I know that he is afraid to come here to meditate." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tali ​​孖 slightly thought about it, even more surprised, asked: "That is to say, you have confirmed that Jawi and the vampire have a relationship? You How do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
