			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way back to Wangdu was exceptionally smooth. Airy City is a chicken flying dog, the imperial minister and the local official, even the same team of cavalry have no news for a few days. Some people say that there are a large group of thieves nearby and there are also pagan groups that are said to be cannibal. So everywhere there are wealthy people and caravans recruiting bodyguards to guard Asa and follow the team to Wangdu, the caravan came back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stood in front of the big house and couldn’t help but breathe a few times and thought that he would never come back again. When he pushed the two wooden doors and listened to the two familiar ‘吱呀’ sounds, the feeling of going home came to my heart. He screamed unconsciously: "I am back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s amazing to come back." Sandro heard the sound from inside the hut. Got out. He still looks like the dirty robe that still can't see the color. It is still the silk thread on the corners of the beard and the robe. The face is almost completely buried inside. It still looks like the surrounding bodies and organs. lining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Sandro said that, Asa still saw a little smile from his eyes. If there is a feeling of home here, then the old man has the taste of a mixture of family and friends. "You are so unreasonable to do so that I am suddenly tired of work, but I have to pay compensation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa asked: "If you say the world tree leaves, if used How to use the treatment of injuries?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru looked at him casually with a look of disapproval and suspicion. "Have you got it? Was it bought on the street stall?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa took some of the world’s trees from his arms. The leaves were placed on the table in front of Sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru is stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of his face is covered with a beard and a head. I don’t know what it’s. There are only two black and white eyes that look at the leaves of the world tree. The greenness of the leaves was infected with strangeness but it was unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru reached out and slowly picked up the leaves of the world tree with a slight gesture like a fear of offense. His original white hand seems to have been given some vitality under the green of the leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru stayed at the leaves and pale and dry fingers stroking the leaves gently as if the first love boy touched the lover's skin. "How did you get it?" His voice was a little shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get it that way." Asa replied in an understatement. I am very proud of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru still looked at him suddenly and turned to ask: "Do you want to use this thing to save people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to save?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Save the person I want to save." Sa is not good at explaining the cause and effect and answering with a nonsense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Woman?" Sandro is very keen. Asa nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shandro sighed and said, "I actually take this thing to save a woman. Why don’t you just smash yourself and feed the pig?" Frowning and staring at Asa "Do you know what this is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The leaves of the world tree. Didn't you tell me? I still seem to I heard that it is a god or something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru turned back and looked at the leaves and said slowly: "You know how much power this thing can use. What do you do? I looked for it madly when I was young. It took me ten years to find clues and then spent ten years trying to get it but I couldn’t get it.” He sighed and shook his head. "I didn't expect that I wouldn't think about it now, and it came to me by myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, this is what I got. Asa wants to remind him but see that he is so invested and embarrassed to interrupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I got it in the past twenty years," Sandro was completely immersed in the feelings of the majestic eyes of the year, and his eyes were out of sync with his age. The spirit of pride and enthusiasm. "I will." He frowned bravely as if he really returned to the year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He threw the leaves back to Asa and shook his head in disappointment and said, "Take the woman who will save you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa picked up the leaves and shrugged low Said: "Not my woman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not your woman, what are you doing to save? Is it all in your head?" I don't know why. It seems to be a bit irritating by the memory of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is busy putting the leaves into his arms and thinking that he is very strange and thinks and said: "If you can't use a leaf, I will only cut it down a little. Others are for you"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s useless when it’s shredded. You can let her eat it all." Sandra regained an old man. The tiredness and indifference should be turned back to face a body. Asa saw that he was a little weird and wanted to ask but didn't know what to say. Turned to the gate and he went to the Duke's Mansion now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a minute." Sandro suddenly shouted at him: "Don't panic. You return the book to me. What do you take away? That's a very important thing. I am here for a while and say that if you don't come back or lose the book, you can do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Assato turned and said very slyly: "I lent it to others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let someone else?" It is bigger than when I saw the leaves of the world tree. Just now he just squatted now but seemed to have a knife on his butt and jumped up a few steps to rush to Asa's collar and grabbed his collar. Asa’s action on the old man is really sensitive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru’s eyes seem to fall out and bite and ask: “Do you know what it is? Who is it for?” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the daughter of the Duke’s adult. She went out to travel and said that she was watching the book on the road and throwing it behind the bookcase. I thought it was not something important.” Assati It was a little overwhelming to see Sandru at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Women! I know that it’s a woman again! Go and chase me back and go.” Sandro’s temperament ruined Asa’s Poke his head by hand. "Tell you to be younger and more eager to use the above head to think about things that day and night are women and women."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not understand that he was talking I only ran to the Duke’s House and said, “I will first ask her where she is.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of the Duke’s office is high even if he is not seen The eye-catching dress was not awkward, and he quickly informed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was seen that his Duke’s adult had a very gentle smile as soon as he saw an old friend who had not seen him for many years. The Clause next to him, although his expression changed little, his face was a bit cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa said that the Duke of Medicine, which was able to treat the sputum, did not show much reaction. During this time he has searched all the doctors and pastors he can find and his daughter's injury has not only not improved in the slightest, but has deteriorated over time. He has long had no hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the restraint of Asa’s insistence, the Duke took him to the bed of Otaru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for the Duke’s personal arrival with Asa, he couldn’t believe that the bed was in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is already too thin *Human shape is almost no different from the dead. The original plump and rosy cheeks have been completely sunken. The eyes are closed and the face is covered with only the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She has been comatose almost all day since last week. Doctors and pastors have said that she may stop breathing at any time." Duke's tone His heavy feelings are indeed heavy. This is how his daughter looked at her from day to day, how to get slim from the baby in the shackle and now she is watching her slowly die in bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she is also a very important card in his hand to play a relationship with a large and powerful family that directly affects his grand plan . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has been stunned like this and can still eat the leaves of the world tree. Asa was upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
