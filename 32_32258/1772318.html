			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mourning before dying is intertwined with the screams of other Taurens, the muscles are shredded, and the rupture of the bones is mixed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disparity in the strength gap did not make their fighting spirits slack off. The eyes of every bull-headed warrior have been forced into two blood beads by fighting and bloodthirsty. These fighters are never knowing what to die and fear, and the courage of violent fighting and madness is often more than their body and The axe is a more powerful weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the courage and fighting spirit of being strong again and again is irreparable in the face of absolute power differences. Just like the courageous mouse is definitely not the opponent of a tiger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the most common Tauren warrior can be as powerful as a rhinoceros, but in the face of this red-haired woman, it seems that elite warriors seem to be even old The power is not as good as the giant axe in their hands, the red-haired women collided with each other, and all the deformations flew out after a loud bang. At the same time, there are flesh and blood, stumps and the body of the Tauren. The defensive power of prayer and stone skin superposition has no effect in front of this woman. Just like covering another piece of thin paper on a thin piece of paper, it is also a puncture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman’s movements are very stretchy and very casual. Her body is also very long, and the curve wrapped in the tight leather armor is absolutely sexy, but it does not seem to create the slightest association in the bloody rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in less than a minute, more than thirty of the most elite Tauren warriors have become tattered in her hands. The body of the body, scattered around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the red-haired woman has been breathing, and this gesture is completely disproportionate. The expression is very tired and very difficult. Finally, it seems to be Because it was too tired, her movements slowed down, so an axe that the Tauren had gone all out was finally cut down on her back. And the huge steel axe of the size of the body was heavily chopped on the body of the red-haired woman, and the tremendous force made her fight out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No blood emerges from this line of women, this is enough to cut a hole in the city gate, but the leather armor on her back There was a white mark on it. If this axe is indeed cut on the huge body of a dragon. Even if the dragon's scales are thicker, the giant axe with the armor effect is cut to the top with the power of the Tauren warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now this is not a huge body of dragons, but a person who is hundreds of times smaller. Rather than saying that she was cut out by an axe, it is better to say that she jumped out by the power of this axe. The human body is not only light but not forceful, and the agility is not at all comparable to the dragon's huge body. This axe is only <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Less than one-tenth of the power is cut on the body of a red-haired woman. It is almost non-destructive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the moment when the red-haired woman flies out, the thunderous roar is filled with the space of the cave. The roar of the Tauren warrior was immediately submerged in this more magnificent sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fighting on the golden battle bow has already reached its limit, but it is not until this time. Wells was relieved. Only then did this shoot an arrow that gathered all the vindictiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the speed and agility that a red-haired woman shows in the Tauren, only then can he be certain that the arrow will never fail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tauren warrior is almost dead and wounded, but the five have already started the God of Heaven, but the Knights of the Temple have not moved. These Tauren warriors were originally victims, and they all saw that the red-haired women who were red-haired women should not do their best. So they are waiting, waiting for the best out of the phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now until the Tauren are almost completely destroyed, they will wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original condensed light in the golden bow of the war turned into a huge white beam of light across the head of the Tauren warrior and shot at the red-haired woman. In the huge roar, the upper body of the three Taurens completely dissipated, and the entire cave seemed to be slightly trembling under the power of this arrow. These few Taurens died silently and worthless. The white giant beam of light, like the thunder of the world, suddenly descended to the cave at the bottom of the earth, venting the full anger towards the red-haired woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red-haired woman is still flying back. She looks at the light column like Raytheon and suddenly does not breathe. The light in the narrow throat was so bright that it was comparable to the white light that was facing the arrow. Although she has been fighting these Tauren warriors, she has always understood that the five talents standing behind it are the main force inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her attention has always been on these five people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of retreat, the red-haired women threw out the two white ones that had already been the iron smashing axe to meet the thunder. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel giant axe smashed under the arrow of all the temperament of the Knights of the Temple of the Knights, and it was shattered like a glass. The white light column was slightly stagnation and continued to sway toward the red-haired woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red-haired woman’s back is already resting on the rock wall of the cave. There is no way to hide. She suddenly reached out and grabbed the huge beam of light that had arrived. This beam of light is enough for her body to be several times larger. The power and momentum that the year has driven even caused the rock wall behind her to collapse and scatter. Her not tall and strong body seemed to be smashed like a piece of paper in a hurricane. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a muffled sound, with her summoning, the roar of the entire cave that had been filled with the river disappeared, and the white light disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pair of slender, clear-cut hands, one catch, the huge roaring sound and white light disappeared. This grasp caught the wrath of the heavenly thunder and disappeared, as if there had never been an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red and white women’s rock wall splits with her as the core, and Mi’s long steel broken arrow is quietly mentioned in her Between the two hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an arrow that can be shot by a behemoth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A drop of red blood drops from her palm, she finally hurt. At the same time, the light that had just flashed in her eyes dissipated, and the yellow eyes were confused. The big mouth gasped and rented down and bent down and coughed twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, the roar that just subsided again re-swept back with ten times the power, as if the earth-shattering arrow was just a little Prelude only. The entire cave seems to be bursting and shattering in the roar of this vindictive magic and airflow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this time is no longer just an arrow, and two swords and a gun. These three weapons were killed in three directions from three angles, and the enthusiasm of the above was equally fierce. Zheng Qi’s airflow and momentum erupted after the turbulence and swirl of the three weapons, and two or three of the Tauren who were close together were directly fragmented by the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the long-awaited full blow of the three Knights of the Temple, following the arrow of Wellskey. Do not give red-haired women the slightest breath to avoid time. This blow can even destroy half of this huge cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tauren warriors have been killed and wounded, their role has been completed, of course, they did not cause any substantial damage to the dragon as expected, but At least the physical strength of the red-haired woman was consumed, and he created such an opportunity. The Knights of the Temple will never miss such a chance to kill the enemy. The murderous and imposing manners brought out by these three weapons have already locked the red-haired woman firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red-haired woman who had already bent over because of cough suddenly lifted her body, stretched her neck, opened her mouth, and watched the three-spot light-like shrine-like knight There was a scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first voice she has made since her appearance, and this is by no means a voice that people can make. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Knights combined to make the entire cave tremble, but the roar was completely overwhelmed. People who have not seen it will never think that such a voice can come from the small body of such a red-haired woman. Even the strongest behemoths, the greatest Thunderbirds can't make such a ripple. This sound is not only loud, it is not only deafening, but also shaking the heart and shaking the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scream contains the majesty and pressure that is directly added to the shock of all the creatures heard, which cannot be comparable to any other sound. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the tauren who heard this voice had their feet softened. This has nothing to do with things like courage and fighting spirit. This is the instinct to compare the fear of its own huge existence, born with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
