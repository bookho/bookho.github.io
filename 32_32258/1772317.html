			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This slap does not seem to have any domineering power, strength or the like, the skin is delicate and long, and it can be said to be good except for a little more prominent bones. . But in the slap of a shape of such a hand that has not yet been tightly gripped, the Tauren guards commanded a huge head that could withstand a hammer strike, and shattered like a biscuit under heavy punches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of this hand is a red-haired woman, just as Stowe wields a giant axe while roaring, she silently walks from the side The rock cracks were drilled out. While a slap in the face of the Tauren's guardian commander became headless, she also squatted on the chest of another Tauren warrior. The Tauren made a strange sullen sigh, and the chest was sunk to the next big pit while the two soldiers behind him collided and flew out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire huge cave suddenly shook, and the three Taurens smashed a huge depression on the rock wall, and no one could see that It is three Tauren. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This woman seems to be only about thirty years old, with a flame-like red hair and a dark tight-fitting leather armor, but the face is good but the water chest and outline are too Too clear, like an impressionist sculptor deliberately shaped a strong woman face. But the center of her yellow scorpion is a pair of narrow, narrow pupils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is awkward, strong, and with a woman who is too sharp and fierce, it seems to be weak anyway, and the taste of fatigue is not available. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially the Tauren who is twice as tall as her is the same as the paper doll under her hands and feet. But now this woman is breathing. A <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After raising her hand and killing the four most elite Tauren warriors, she bent down halfway and gasped a few breaths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roar and screams broke out from the mouth of the Tauren at this time, and more than forty Taurens rushed toward this strange woman like a tidal wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they still don’t know who this woman is, this woman is undoubtedly an enemy. Absolutely terrifying enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this woman at first sight. Lancelot’s pupils suddenly tightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that the woman’s slap in the face or the kick may actually be directed at him or other knights, but because of him and The location of other knights is too far away. There are so many Taurens in the middle, so this woman has found the front and the strongest Tauren guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no temperament in this hand, very simple and direct action. But Lancelot can see that if he is in the position of Stoic, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, the result is not much better than him. The Tauren commander is dead, and he will be injured anyway. This woman did not have the slightest murderousness before, like a butterfly flying out of a crack in the stone. It's not just fast, but it's not even alert or alert when you first see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Knights of the Temple saw the woman, and the sound of surprise on the face could not be suppressed, but they were all the same as Lancelot. /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No action. Still standing in the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman is still breathing, as if she is very tired, this weak expression is very uncoordinated in her too strong appearance. She panted like a Tauren warrior in the face of the tide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horror of the Tauren priests, the magical aura of the Tauren warriors kept shining, and these Taurens were already smothered. It seems that the ground is bleeding, and the skin is quickly condensed with a layer of stone armor. These priests were specially selected for this battle, and the bloodthirsty, quick and stone skins are already masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot still didn't move, just turned to the side of the Shrine Knight with his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple were smeared at the same time, and they mourned the prayer: "The grace of the Lord. In the name of the Lord. Please give the heroic warrior the Lord." Glory... In the name of the Lord, give the soldiers a blessing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple are not all dedicated to martial arts. These two white magics are no worse than the standards of the bishops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece of white light is scattered on the Tauren, while another brighter and more dazzling white light is also illuminated from the Knights of the Temple. The top auxiliary white magic 'Tianzhiyou' attached to the glorious armor of the Knights of the Temple is also the fluctuation of the white magic in the huge caves, so that the cave where the dragon lives is as holy and bright as the church. The faint hymns flow in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a person. This is the first reaction of Lancelot to see the woman's back hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it seems to be the human body, the person's face, the human movement. I even saw a woman who was very character but now very weak. But Lancelot knew that it was never human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can be as strong, no one can completely defy the killing in the killing. Lancelot is very sure, even if it is himself, there is Gru, such a person who has cultivated martial arts to almost the ultimate can not kill the murderous at the time of killing. Even the Tamik Knights regard killing people as people who eat and drink. When they are shot, there is no murderousness. But the moment when people actually kill, there will be a bit of murder in the instinct. This is absolutely unavoidable. It is instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When humans kill ants, insecticides and other things that are not recognized in the subconscious, there will be no murderous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman did not have the slightest murderousness when she shot, these can be compared with any warrior, the Tauren in her eyes, but in the heart is just ants, green worms Something is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is a behemoth, it is impossible to have such a mentality in the face of these elite Tauren warriors. The only one in the mainland can have this kind of momentum. The only one that has this kind of strength is not one person, one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five white 'Tianzhiyou' beams are shrouded in the surroundings of the five knights, the white magic of the majestic waves, and the two do not emit white magic. The figure of the Knight of the Temple of Light disappeared like a disturbed reflection of the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple who came here with the Tauren are not seven, but only five. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two look like real people are the effect of using the top water magic avatar mirroring, although the mirrored phantom can not attack, but the appearance is already Unrecognizable, and even sound the corresponding sound. The Knights of the Temple did not speak, and the Tauren people naturally could not distinguish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Slayer is of course important, but more importantly, there are other things. These two knights are going to do more important things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the Knights of the Temple have not rushed, and Wellskey has straightened the huge gold bow of his hand, the steel broken arrow The chord of chord, vindictiveness and white magic moved from his body to the bow and arrow, aiming at the woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman is still breathing, facing the tauren warrior who is flooding like a tide, she is still shaking her face and feeling weak, the body is one-sided Then it fell into the light of the forehead of the Tauren. Instant flesh and blood. It is not the flesh and blood of a woman, but the flesh and blood of the Tauren warriors. The shape of the red-haired woman in the torrent of more than ten giant axes swept up like a bulging boat seems to be smashed at any time, but this seems 'anytime' but it has never happened, but it has never happened. It’s a woman who doesn’t seem to have much strength and strength to fight, pump, touch, touch the body of the Tauren warrior, and then the soldiers whose muscles are as strong as rock statues are immediately scattered like blistered bread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tauren priests continually squatted at the sorcerer’s unique curse, but it did not seem to have any effect on the woman in the squad, and then the priest summoned The spurs came out on the ground, but the spikes of the earth magic smashed into the woman's body and began to collapse and have no effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests began to panic. There are a few who seem to think of something, screaming in the language of the Tauren. Only who can't hear them, the shouts and screams of the Tauren warriors have filled the caves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, a Tauren’s Tomahawk finally slashed the red-haired woman’s body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
