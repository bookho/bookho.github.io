			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedestrians on both sides of the street stopped to watch the admiration of the knight on the white horse. The girls are even more eager to look at the eyes of the man is the most hoped that the woman reveals when he sees himself, that is, worship, intoxication and longing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse is one of the best horses in the world. The silvery knight's armor does not seem to be a foreign object that needs to be worn, but the natural temperament that is exposed to the outside is so powerful because it is worn on him. A golden illusion is the radiance of the sun, and the body and mind are willing to become part of him. The straight eyebrows of the sword eyebrows are handsome, but the silhouette of the man's mighty face is not lost. The light that the sun shone on the armor and the gold turned back to make the observer look like his own glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, such a person must have an identity that matches him. There are several people in the passers-by who are whispering. This is the son-in-law of the Duke of the Royal Paladin of El Niño, the captain of the Duke of Mullah, the son-in-law of the Duke of Mulke. Some of the listeners immediately imagined that their mother had been jealous with Sir Malak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowvis doesn't care about the crowds around. In his eyes, these stupid civilians and ants are no different in their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is annoyed now or he has been annoying for more than a month and now he has to waste time here. If he can, he will immediately pull out the sword and kill all the people on the street who have to let the team slowly move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier actually escaped from the kingdom and may even lurk somewhere in the kingdom. This incident has made him sleepless for a month. Once he remembered that the low-lying hybrid might be hiding in a dark hole and snickering for him to escape from a knight's hand and be proud of the knight's worried headache, he would fall into extreme anger. When he took the soldier, he carefully removed the most sensitive place in his body like a manicure and asked him to scream for three days in a pool of blood like a dog. Three nights with his tongue, he screamed at his sole and asked him to kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only good news is that at least the soldier has not revealed the news yet. It is possible that he himself does not know the true meaning of the message and will bury this thing with himself forever in the shadows. The progress of the beasts in the west is also unexpectedly good, as long as there are no more than half a year. But the soldier is still like an unidentified bomb that may have been damaged by the tide. It may not know which day suddenly emerged from a certain place and the subtle layout of the whole thing is out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today his injured fiancee was finally sent back. He also had to let go of the city and then escorted back to the Duke’s House. He is very reluctant to waste time on such things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is extremely annoyed to waste time. Time is precious. Every minute should be very efficient. It should be rewarded. It should help you gain more power and higher status. When a person is alive, he should go up and go up. This is his creed. He is also proud of his own creed and despise those who live like a worm for a day. Therefore, he is extremely annoyed with everything that violates his proud creed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he also knows that she is equally reluctant to see herself. She is not the kind of disgusting kindness that he is not a disgusting disregard. This attitude made Clauses very annoying and even angry. He is accustomed to others who admire him and admire him for fear that he even allows others to hate him. He hates him. At least it shows that in a person's mind he is a powerful and can not be ignored. But it never allows others to ignore the fact that he does not allow others to look at him like a glimpse of a glimpse in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one person in the world who looks at him like that. If it is someone else, he must unscrupulously tell the person who dares to despise him. He can tear anyone who looks at him. But this person is his fiancee, a person who will accompany him for the rest of his life. And now he has to waste a lot of time to protect her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is undoubtedly a very annoying thing if he can never do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is no way that sometimes the impression of a bystander is the key to the significance of this matter. The daughter of the Duke of Mulak was injured by the relationship between the Duke and the El Ni family. The eldest son of the Grand Duke and the fiance of the princess, then will fly to the outside of the city and his fiancee will be escorted back to the Dukes House. . Since people think that things are only the way to demonstrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which angle he does not want to care about, he just does not allow a low-lying country to have his suspicions in any aspect. I am the strongest, the most perfect, the most powerful and the best. This concept has long been rooted in his mind and is also his pride. He is really a very proud person, so it is easy to get bored and easy to get angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the damn soldier would take this opportunity to approach her. Then you can cut the guy's hands and feet one by one in front of her face and let her take a good look at who is more to ignore. Clavis tried to give this boring action that made him feel bad. But he also knows that this is just a self-consolation and think about it. The soldier is not stupid to this point anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sister, do you notice that the girls look at your eyes?" Chris is looking at the peers with the look she described. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Clavis is focused on his own thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't always be so cool." Chris's eyes went deeper. This girl is the sister of his fiancee. At the age of seventeen, she has a similar appearance to her sister and is more beautiful. The only beautiful character in the kingdom is the frivolity and incomprehension of the typical aristocratic girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like all the little daughters in the family, she is very much loved by her father. And when she was born, the Duke did not have much time to spend on educating her children. There is no difference in the growth environment with other noble children. Some time ago she actually asked to go to the Magic Academy to study ancient books, but it seems that it is just a little bit of a sense of aura to add a noble meaning to herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis sometimes wonders why the Duke of the Lord did not marry this daughter. Such a childish and superficial girl can easily grasp that he is comfortable with the road and is much more convenient for both the Duke and the self. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden commotion from the rear of the team. "There is a person who wants to climb the Miss carriage and is caught by us." A guard came over to report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This report made Klauvis suddenly think of something that was just a delusion. A great fortune of a fortune came to his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several soldiers are holding a person who is covered in a cloak. It’s a hunchback or a scorpion wearing a cloak that hasn’t been washed for hundreds of years. It’s easy to think of someone who is doing some weird work in the dark basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis looked at him carefully and suddenly the cloak was actually dressed so that he could hide all the body parts of this person. Even if you stand opposite, it is difficult to see that the face inside is even vague under the effect of the cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis's eyes were staring at the face that was submerged in the shadow of the cloak as if to smash every detail inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped forward to the front of this person. Every step is very slow and steady. It seems that the front is a hard time. The ghosts appearing from the gap of time will be dissipated into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly held the handle of his waist and said one word at a time: "Put the things on his head." At this distance he has Grasping will never let anyone escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloak opened first. The soldier who pulled the cloak was immediately scared to jump back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sheet is not suitable for faces that appear in broad daylight. The facial features were melted by a pot of boiling water, and then re-condensed by hand. It was like a poor clay sculpture master who was dissatisfied with his work and pressed another hand on the original ugly face. There is also a piece of purple sarcoma oil that can be seen as if it will burst out of the hot pus. "It is the hunchback assistant of the old man of Sandru." Someone inside the guard recognized it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis carefully scanned this face from top to bottom and couldn’t find a trace of the element that coincided with the expected face. nausea. The anger and disgust in the eyes of the guards who turned to the words, even one of the most stupid cows can feel him asking: "Do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards fought for themselves Clarification: "I don't know that many people know that this guy is the assistant of the old man of Sandu who is the body of the city." A lot of passersby echoed. Some of them shouted: "Humper, do you think that it is a carriage that pulls the body? Hurry up and admit it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
