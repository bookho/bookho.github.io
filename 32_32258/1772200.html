			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the Lord lead your evil souls to repent in purgatory." Abin looked at the head of the Cardinal and the soft-skinned body was full of bloodshot eyes. The murderousness and anger have dissipated. The finger smeared a cross on his chest and recited the prayer with the devout look and tone of a standard standard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he grew up under the guidance of Relas, the old man of Relais always wanted him to be a devout believer but he himself was not. Even on the wild land, he saw that Relas used the shelter of God to call out the white light of the sky. He still did not think that this was a miracle. He felt that it was not God who saved himself that he was his own grandfather. However, since then his words and deeds have been completely different from a believer or to say that he is no different from the old man. There is no god in his heart, just someone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis has no god at this moment, even the human beings and everything in front of them are illusory as if they suddenly fall into a world that is completely unbelievable and unreasonable. in. The head of Escher fell to her feet, but she couldn’t believe that the great magician of the Megatron 6 and the Pope’s singer was stunned and the most unbelievable was brought by himself. The Abin came down with a sword. She looked at Abin with her kind eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin also saw Talis hesitating about Zhang Zhong’s desire to speak but not knowing what to say. He knows that what is said at this time is useless. The fact that it is in front of you is enough to shock the facts behind it. Needless to say Talis. No matter who it is, it is hard to believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bishop adult ~ ~" or a few guards behind the Talis, the guardian warriors suddenly saw the screams in the room awakened. She remembered this. As a knight of the Temple of the Knights, you shouldn’t take this murderer anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s her time at the door that has given Asa enough time. The door is not too wide. Talis has just been able to block the outside guard a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aescher's death in Asa's body of magical power is completely silent, although still, but it does not have any effect. He now has two broken ribs in addition to his arm. There are no problems with other aspects of the body. Of course, the arm and the two ribs are broken, whichever is not ‘no problem,’ but at least his magical power is still there. It can be done without problems. Asa took out the seeds of a plant from her arms and smothered her own blood and poured almost all the magical power into the doorstep of Talis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seed is one of several magic items given to him by Elder Lloyd of the Tula Forest, although these things originally required the natural magic of the elves to move of. But according to Elder Lloyd's words, Asa's blood that is rich in the vitality of the leaves of the world tree can also be used for even greater effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seed exploded just after landing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accurately it should be growth, but the degree of growth, no matter who sees it, does not think it is growing but exploding. Just a small seed in the blink of an eye instantly swollen into a large group of thick thorns. Then the thorns immediately rooted on the floor and continued to explode. It immediately grew into a thick and thick before Talis’s eyes. The dense thorns blocked the door tightly. Even the horsewoman and several guards were pushed a few steps by this explosive thorn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thorn is not limited to blocking the door but continues to grow with amazing growth. The body of the Cardinal is quickly buried in it. Abin has to retreat. Ai Mei, who picked up the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled and watched the rapid growth of the thorns. He did not expect this thorny obstacle to be so effective. His knife still stayed in the cardinal body. There is no way to get it back now. The key is that he has not learned how to control. In this way, after a few seconds, the room will be filled with this thorn. He quickly got up and gave Jessica the elimination of paralysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thorns have long been so thick that they can’t see the horsewoman and the guards. They can only hear the sounds of their screaming and slashing the thorns, but these thorns are not just The length of the tough and abnormal life is even more incomparable. Even the Knights of the Temple and the guards of the savage swords can't cut the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this case, no matter how you explain it, it’s useless to go with me. I will find a way to cure your sister." Asa turned his head. Said to Abin, who is holding his sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled and took out four reels from his arms and gave Jessica two copies to Abin. "It was originally intended for Hilton and Anderson that it was only for them to go to Oufu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin heard the word Oufu hesitated a little. Then I sighed helplessly. In this case, it is not necessary to say that Oufu even Nikon has no choice. No matter what kind of thief ship, it is not only hard to be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thorns are still growing wildly, but the sound of chopping thorns suddenly stops. Asa’s face changed. Although he still couldn’t understand what it meant, but he was sure that it was not a good thing. He quickly said to Jessica and Abin, “Hurry up.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reel can only be sent to the previous person. Abin hastily put a reel into Ayimei's hand to help her use it. Jessica also unfolded the scrolls and the bodies of both of them wrapped in the blue light and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa and others saw that the figure of the two had completely disappeared, and then they started the reel with their own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer reel from the unfolding to the full transfer of the person is only two or three seconds, that is, one quarter of a yawn, half a breath, a sneeze . It was so short that Jessica was first transferred and then opened to Asa and Yabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Asa and Abin open the scrolls and start the blue light as usual to wrap them up and then the next step is that both of them immediately leave this bloody and The space of the thunder and rain is just a little bit of time. But the same action is because the result of this little time gap has already gone a long way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When both of them also had blue light, the walls on both sides of the room were broken at the same time. The two figures rushed to the two men in the light with a sword full of vindictiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even after the broken wall, the Jianguang is still as fierce as the electric cast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transmitting magic can only be a matter of sending people away. It doesn't mean that the scrolls are all open. On the contrary, the person who uses the reel at this time can't use any magic or even the body can't have too much action, otherwise the surrounding magic circle will dissipate because of the fluctuations, as long as it is a little knowledgeable magician knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two swordsmen who just rushed in are the two old swordsmen who are close to the armor. It is undoubted that the guard of Escher retired from Celeste. Although the templars are not as energetic as they were when they were young, the experience and skills are already in full swing. When they broke into the wall, they saw that the two men were surrounded by the magic of transmitting magic. Staying with all your strength and desperately rushing to the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the two Templars Asa and Abin may not be able to pay. But now the delivery reels have been completely converted in order to transmit the magic. As long as the body moves and slams, they will only stay here and there will never be only these two templars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you don’t hide, even if they can really send back to Oufu, it’s just two bodies. For two templars who have been murdering on the battlefield for decades, it is absolutely impossible to kill two people who are unable to move and cut apples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa sighed in his heart. The transmission light on his body dissipated as he moved. He also reached out and held Abin: "You don't move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin's body is slightly After shaking, he did not move his body. The magic of the transmission did not dissipate but became more and more concentrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just removed the shape of the sword light and brushed a piece of blood on his back. This absolutely fatal sword is just a little bit of flesh. Asa escaped from the sword that stabbed himself, and also reached out and smacked in the hand to block the sword that had stabbed Abin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Asa’s transfer magic for this blocker has been completely moved. His last look at Asa's expression was a kind of complex gratitude and his body shape completely disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled a bit, but he was helpless. He has the ability to help the Abin to block this sword, but he does not have the ability and ability to help him block the sword. It’s hard to do it yourself, but it’s better to help him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
