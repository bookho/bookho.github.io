			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wells stunned and looked at the man who had intercepted his arrow. Using an arrow to intercept another arrow is hard for him to do. And the degree of destructive power of this arrow is no different from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female patrolman has already stood tall in the elves. Now the chickens stand taller and her body is actually nearly half as big as I saw it. It is almost taller than Hilika. The taut clothes slid along the body to create a curvaceous contour. The black bow of the war was once again looming in her body with her green vindictive light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening this bow is not just a brute force. Prior to this, the female patrols tried to fight all the vindictiveness and strength, but only barely opened it once, and now she can at least continue to shoot. The variation of her body is not just about increasing height and strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf girl next to her has just removed the green leaves from the female patrol. It is obvious that this alienation of the body is the spell effect she uses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone stops. If anyone starts our arrow, it will be welcome." With thousands of bows and arrows around the elders of Royde The voice is a lot more majestic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros is in a good time to throw an ice wall spell with all the restored mana to block the templar. Although this thin ice wall is not much different from the paper for the Templars, no one dares to move. Breaking this barrier in this case may be a hands-on signal to the surrounding elves. The templars all look to the Adelaide bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean by Elder Lloyd?" Adelason looked at the Elder Elder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Lloyd replied slowly: "I just want everyone to stop. Our friends are on both sides. We will not allow our friends' blood-stained Tulare forest. The land."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adra snorted: "These two are the leaders of the evil orcs and the sins of the whole big 6 are wanted. The criminals of the heavens. Do you want to stand with them? You are an enemy with us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is this possible?" Elder Lloyd was unbelievable The mantle expression was somewhat anxious to explain to the owner. "If I really stand with Cedros, will I still persuade here? Isn’t the arrow of the tens of thousands of elves here enough to use enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adra licked and then his brow wrinkled his face changed slightly. This explanation is easily reminiscent of the possibility that things will go to an uncontrollable level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lloyd sighed. I waved my hand and said with a bitter tone and expression: "I said I hope everyone will stop. You are all our friends. Even if you do have a holiday, you don't want you to argue here."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone will retreat first." Adela's face was slightly green. Waving to signal the Templars to come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa next to Hilton was greatly relieved and almost sat down. He never thought that he would have the courage to face so many templars holding the swords in his life, and he had already been unable to open because of excessive tension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the only one who has a sigh of relief. Everyone else did not feel relaxed because of this unexpected stop. Their eyes are watching the growing and increasingly violent storms in the center of the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru and Lancelot probably didn’t hear the elder elders and even if they heard them, they wouldn’t stop and couldn’t stop. And Elder Lloyd did not let the elves shoot to stop the battle between the two men or that he knew that the elves could not stop it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flying dust is like a cloud that has been pulled on the ground and is not condensed in the field. Two blurred figures in the clouds move in the enclave. Rotating and then colliding with a lightning-like flash of light and then flashing is a thrilling thunderous bang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people and elves have stopped their movements. Looking at the central group of rolling fog. But almost all of them have been unable to tell the difference. The hurricane that can't capture the shadows from time to time, and the sound and light have already come out of the understanding of ordinary people. It seems that the two gods, which should have been above nine days, have been exposed to each other because of their mutual fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expressions of both Sedros and Adela are unusually dignified. Although they all blessed their own eagle-eye sharp spells, they still couldn't see and understand the battle. But because they can't understand that they are more nervous, the two players are the strongest of the two sides, as long as one side is defeated. The balance of strength will be broken immediately. Even if there is interference from the elves, you can't fight for it right away here, but the situation in the future will surely change for this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The look of the Templars are almost the same as or more than the Cardinal. Fighting in the field is their idol of justice in their minds. It is already more and more that a person should have attributes that cannot be defeated and will not die. But this battle has already been more and more. They understand that their minds have all been put into battle. Only the Cavaliers did not appear to be the slightest tension, but stared blankly at a pair of blue-like scorpions, but they were still like a quiet lake. The lakes and the waters were reluctant to smash and reflect the battle in front of them. Everything is reflected in it and carved into my mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The look of the four Knights of the Temple is still a little nervous but not more intense and more of an ecstasy. Wellskai. Talis and Adriek and Christine, who had no problem under Adra's treatment, looked at the battlefield as if they were a painter watching the god of art. The singer is listening to the singing of the melody elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is almost as much as they are. Although he is not the strongest in the spectator, perhaps only he is the person who can best see the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meditation has already reached the limit and can clearly see the battle between Lancelot and Gru in the field. The flow of the two men's actions vindictively everything flies but is reflected in his mind in an orderly manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although meditation makes the mind calm and sober, Asa can still feel his blood boiling. Every action of Gru and Lancelot can make him feel that something is burning in the depths of his soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t find any deep words to describe the battle between the two. If you have to say it, only two words are most suitable: beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glu every move. The explosive force contained in each attack has already exceeded the limits of humanity. The power that appeared in the body that did not seem to differ much from ordinary people made him surprised and admired many times. The more important Gru body's momentum is that he has no extra action, even disdain that defense is always offensive. Even in the case of urgency and urgency, he used all means to knock his fists and feet toward his opponent's body. This way, combined with his great destructive power, is strong and simple. Asa even believes that even if you are facing the face of one of the greatest behemoths Gru, you can easily deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more human beings make him feel bloody. Because he clearly remembers that he has fought against such opponents. I have faced such a strong body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And watching the battle of Lancelot made this boiling a step further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot does not have the power of Gru to destroy any opponent's strength without the invincible momentum but he can actually be under such power and momentum It’s even more shocking to show that the defeat is not revealed. His movements are still as smooth as the flow of water, every smallest detail and movement are perfectly matched and complement each other seamlessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not as simple as Gru. His sword skills are perfect, and the temperament and magic are also used in battle. It’s not just a combination of sword and skill. It’s just like his own.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One . Every sword of every sword is not used by him every time. Instead, he is naturally released from his body like blood and breathing. It seems to be simpler than all simple because it is to condense the original complicated things to the extreme. The simplicity that can be produced. It’s a big deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this perfect way of fighting recalling the combination of vindictive and magical powers that have just remained in their bodies, Asa feels that she has touched some thing. Although he is still not quite sure what these are, but just a feeling of embarrassment is enough to make him excited. He clearly felt that he was taking a step up on a mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silhouette suddenly rises from the dusty and vindictive clouds and is a Lancelot in the Glorious Battle. He was wrapped in the brilliance of white magic, and there were many cracks and depressions on the shining armor. In the air, he shouted the milky white light from his body and instantly expanded and solidified into a huge holy cross sword. This time, the cross sword is bigger and more light than any one. The white light of the holy light is ten meters long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
