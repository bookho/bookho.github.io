			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent sun is like a huge red stove. The things in the furnace are boiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boiled is that people are blood is killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood has changed the color of this desert from dry, dry golden to red. The high temperature transpiration of the corpses on the ground and the smell of blood in the air is so strong that every breath is swallowing a group of spicy flesh and blood. But no one cares that all of them are swallowing such a breath and screaming and screaming and killing each other. Any fight between natural enemies in nature is far less devastating than human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nomads uniform uniform robes riding on the high horses without any armor but facing the fully armed swordsman but no one retreats and hesitates The scimitars in their hands and the body also cut the jab on the cracks of the armor of the swordsman and used all means to keep as many wounds as possible as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other half is a warrior riding a wild boar. These are another nomadic tribe on the edge of the desert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These tribes had to be huddled under the army of Celeste. These wild boar warriors are desperately holding down the cavalry. Although the bodies of wild boars and warriors are scattered around under the impact of heavy armor and rifle, they have almost no effective resistance but still have not retreated. But no matter how bravely they are, the gap between the equipment and the number of people is irreparable. The church's troops are gradually gaining the upper hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Allah is on the evil Celeste's forces that have taken advantage of the Prophet adults. You still have to go back." The guardian’s golden account After the fall of a large part of the remaining half, it is already full body blood. As the spiritual leader of the tribe, the Prophet adults should not have appeared at the forefront of this battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prophet is a black-and-black middle-aged celestial celestial robes that forcibly came to the forefront of the battlefield under the guards of the swordsmen. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, it should be with Oufu in the middle of the battle, and Leicester suddenly turned his head and concentrated the unprecedented strength to the nomadic tribes in the southern desert. It took only a few days to capture the desert that originally belonged to the tribe. This is the last battle. All nomadic warriors have already taken their lives out. For their God and for the home of the rear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intensive winds of the wind broke out and the two golden knives jumped up in front of the prophet and several other companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A torrential rain hits the dense leaf on the banana leaf for the next second. These two knives are like plugged in countless bamboo sticks and then become one. The group of banana leaves fell down and the excessive arrows made their bodies almost rotted. It is impossible to keep the shape of this person completely without having to say that life is going to be shot at the same time. This is obviously a criticism of the spiritual leader of the prophet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where can we escape? The back camp is the headquarters of the tribal alliance. Even if we can escape, the tens of thousands of tribes and old women will not escape." "The voice of the prophet has spread to the ears of all nomadic warriors with great grandeur that is not commensurate with his body and age." "Perhaps Celeste will not kill them. But it will force them to betray God to believe in their evil gods. This is more evil than killing them. The betrayal of the soul of God can only be forever in hell. And when the war is dead, Allah can see in heaven..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the voice of the prophet, the nomads were as high and moral as they were mad. There was no defensive means. They had completely ignored the use of all available means and even used the body to smash and use their teeth to bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Allah can see the bravery of the soldiers. Can give them blessings..." The prophet Zhang's blue light shone on him. Then almost all nomads have the same light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests behind the swordsmen were always responsible for the auxiliary medical care. Now they are all rushing around and using purifying to dispel the light of the nomads. That is the effect of blessing. This is not a too much auxiliary spell, but it is used in thousands of troops. This effect is no worse than any one. The nomads who had already been at a disadvantage had begun to stabilize their positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a ride in the knight array that was pinned down and rushed toward the prophet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Block him." Several nomads rushed over in the golden knives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a muffled sound. The white light column illuminates on the knight's body. The knight even stops without stopping. He uses this momentum to directly hit several nomads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the Knights of the Temple!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the magic of white light, the Knights of the Temple opened the sky. The glory of the armor. This time it was not a few but a large group of nomads rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shrine knight has come out of the brigade, single-handedly riding with a full white light on the battlefield, rushing out of a bloody road, the rifle without any nomadic warrior can Slightly resisting each shot, one pick and one thorn, there is a warrior flying or being swept by a long gun to make two sections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as the Cavaliers continue to rush into the nomadic warriors, the more and more of his forward momentum has finally slowed down. A clearing knight actually abandoned the horse and jumped on the body of a nomadic warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the nomads slammed into a strange posture like a overwhelmed shelf. The Knights of the Temple took advantage of the high leaps and flew to the Prophet. Dozens of scimitars were thrown at him with fierce winds, but the Knights of the Temple did not pay attention to the clinking knives. These scimitars did not have any effect under the astounding protection of the Glorious Battle Armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prophet screamed and a fireball rolled over the knight in midair. The Cavaliers also cast a steel gun in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a vindictive and white magical knight’s long gun, and the fireball is like a smog that is gently dissipated and the momentum of the gun is not reduced. Boom to the prophet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A golden account knives are one meter wide and one foot long before the prophet, like a small door knives straight up. But after a bang, the knife broke into pieces and flesh and blood flew together like a knife and a tower-like body under the gun like cotton and paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is a golden account, the handcuffs have already opened the prophet, and the Cavaliers have been able to pierce the warriors. Then the three golden knives waved the big knife in their hands and greeted the fallen knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple did not hide and did not let the fall down, he could not hide, could not let the big knife cut on the glory of the battle armor is a giant like a bell ring. It is the most basic condition for a golden knives to get an oncoming running horse from start to finish. The knives used by these knives are even heavier and heavier than the dwarf's axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protective power of the Glorious Battle Armor is no longer possible to completely resist such attacks. The knight’s body trembled and almost smashed the blood. The blood from the armor’s mouth oozes out of the mouth of the helmet. But the long sword at his waist also flashes into several white lights. Six paragraphs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers have not been hurt, but he did not stop at all. The Prophet has been retreating under the protection of the last two golden knives. More nomads are coming in. He waved a long sword and flew out of the head to insert a golden account knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunman who had lost his sword and did not rush forward actually picked up his fist and punched the prophet. The doorknife of the golden knives cut straight down the top of his head. No matter how good the armor is, it is impossible to resist such an attack. If the knife can be cut, even if the skull can not break the cervical vertebrae, it will never stand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of death, evil..." The face of the prophet has already had a magical glow on his hand. As long as the other party gives him a chance to release the magic, even if it has no effect on the Glorious Battle Armor, at least he can smash the Knights of the Shrine and fight behind it<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will flood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the words behind him couldn’t be said and they were recessed into the head with the nose and the mouthful of the teeth under the fist of the Knights of the Temple. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers still did not retreat to his head and body just slightly a big knife on the helmet to make an ugly bang, only to cut his shoulders. He made a terrible slap. Even the scapula with the brilliance of the armor has cracked. He can't resist even because he only has one hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight’s helmet ruptured and flew up a golden long blood with a fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
