			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not only the swordsman who sent the food to the cell, but Lancelot, who has to go to the cell to check the two times every day. The special cockroaches and any abnormalities in this cell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa had to admire Lancelot. As the knight of the big 6 status, the most admired is the spokesperson of justice. He is also familiar with all the thief-like tricks of thieves, and he is familiar with all the attempts of Asa. The food that was delivered every day was just a bowl of gruel. After three days of drinking from the swordsman to Asa's mouth, Asa no longer had any strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it was not until the thirteenth day that Asa really understood that he could not escape by his own strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these thirteen days, he has tried all the methods. The last time he even forced to break his bones slowly and slowly from the chain. Take it out. For his lack of physical strength, this is undoubtedly a long and painful work in English. It took him half a day to try to maintain his appearance and the flaws of the small and half-rib fractures without hurting the internal organs and the aorta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Lancelot walked in and only looked at him and said faintly: "The method I used when I was fifteen. You are full of wind." The head is cold and sweaty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"15 years old..." Asa smiled. He kept his head down and pretended to be in a coma. The cold sweat. "It turns out that you are really stronger than me. I can't stand this pain but can't help but sweat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't help but I was stripped at the time. A little half of the skin was covered with blood, so no one noticed it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot came up to help Asa’s bones slowly reset with healing magic . "I tell you. This is not a good idea. Even if you can take it out and want to completely recover the injury and physical strength, it is almost impossible to leave it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you ask how you escaped at the time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last one was to save me by my companion before I escaped but he died... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you mean that I have to wait for my companion to save?" Asa’s eyes jumped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot caught this expression and shook his head and said, "You can’t escape even if you have a companion. Here is the glory of the glory of the castle Magnus. Consciousness can use the king's ring to cover the entire castle. No matter how high the master is, it is impossible to sneak in. If it is the same attack, it will only die. Even the Necromancer can not be the opponent of the entire Glorious Castle. His Majesty also wants someone to save you. It is a good opportunity to get rid of those dangerous people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa did not answer. This is exactly what he is most worried about. If you know that he was caught, will someone really save him? Sandru? Aier's mother-in-law? It is a pity that no matter who faces it, it will be the entire shining castle. He saw the power of the ring in the hands of the pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is by no means a force that one can fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is very valuable to save the lives of tens of thousands of fighters without being so depressed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Asa cold smiled: "I should be happy in your words? Unfortunately, I don't have such a great sentiment and no great sense of justice like you. If you are tied here, you must be very happy." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not just being a person, no one is willing to die, no matter how great the reason is, this is instinct. But people always have to compare Instinct is higher. So you have to give up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I am not so sublime."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, I might as well try to think about what you said, your death can really keep a lot of people alive and make you better. Sometimes sublime is a good analgesic." Slotte smiled and smiled deeply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your concern. I don't have that habit, but I still want to thank you. I know that you have made me a lot better. If it weren't for me, I can only be one." Hands and feet of people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
