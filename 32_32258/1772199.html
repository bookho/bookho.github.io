			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa lost his knife and screamed instinctively and smothered his head with all his strength. It seemed that two knives and three hammers had to be smashed in the chaos. Both hands can guarantee that their heads will not explode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bishop of Ascher also squirted a large mouthful of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bloody urgency should hardly be used to describe the use of bowls of beer or pots. This is not like an old man who has suffered a cough of blood after a knife. It is like a big belly. The brawny has just had enough blood and was smashed out in the stomach. The beard and the white bishop’s clothes were all red and the face was already white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lungs have been worn by a hole and the mental magic is not suitable for the following attack. He is forced to turn the magical power of control thinking into a shock. If you are not the one who is full of his magic, the deep magical magic is what he is good at, but this magical counterattack can already have his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not the reason why he sprayed such a big blood. More than half of this blood is forced out of his body by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright magician at his level can be almost completely distinguished from the common mage even if their body is still weak and weak, but if you want to say that the vitality is tenacious And resistance to damage, even a strong warrior is not necessarily comparable to them. As long as it is not immediately fatal and can not recover the damage can be suppressed with the white magic of the body and then slowly treated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the blood-sucking effect of the dead magic on the knife is enough to deal with one of the strongest behemoths. But for a top white magician who is inherently familiar with Necromancer magic, it doesn't matter at least not immediately fatal. Just use all the white magic to suppress the dead spirit and darkness. Just have another priest to help him and even take it out by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, it is impossible for him to ask someone to heal again. Only a little bit slower than Asa, another slender figure followed him into the room. This piece of Jianguang brought a touch of Jianguang, although it was not as strong as the former Asa's knife light, but the impulsive and pungent temperament was like a pin that was hidden in the wind and rain. And still only the absolutely deadly needle above the blue light is the fate of the label. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aesquel’s big blood is from the rushing figure to the blood and the blood has become a large bloody The mix completely sealed the man in front of the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is naturally Jessica who has been lurking with Asa. In fact, she was prompted by Asa's shot and should get up with Asa and break through the window. If you can do this step, the Cardinal will die if he has another body shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what is unexpected to Asa. At the moment when he broke the window, he rushed out of the ground and murdered his breath and the momentum not only forced the window to smash, but Jessica, who should be infiltrated with him at the same time, was also blocked from the next level and let the two shot. Deviation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to fight below, Ismail is definitely a terrible enemy, so Asa shot out all his murderousness and strength in one breath. Do not move as quiet as Lin. Once you take the shot, you must go all out to make a blow. This is the main point of assassination. But he forgot that the horrible thing about this opponent is that his magic is physically only a savage old man and he only needs a ‘fast’ word. The murderous power and the power of the earth-shaking rock made a counter-effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little slower Jessica greeted the ground with a large spurt of blood from Ascher. But she did not hesitate and sigh more quickly. She knows that this is a perfect time. It may be the only time. The time of the Temple Knights and the guards. Although they are leaving, it is impossible to see how far the wind and lightning sounds are loud, but it is impossible for the martial arts masters to detect the broken windows. The sound and screams. Therefore, she did not have the slightest reduction in the lily and it was faster and more embarrassing. Even if there is a fatal magic curse in this bloody fog, she will send the dagger on her hand into the throat of the cardinal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body rushed through the blood without any hindrance. Jessica also had a short surprise. This is simply a big mouthful of blood and does not contain any magic. To any protective barrier. But what followed was the cardinal of the Cardinal with a very painful snoring: "Dess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ascher’s foot almost fell to the ground. Even his body is very well maintained compared to the old man of the same age. It is unbearable to spray a quarter of his body's blood. But only in this way can only temporarily absorb the blood and the essence of the knife by the force of the blood. He has a way to draw some magical power to cast this spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in order to use this magical cardinal that is freely swaying, he almost erased his old life, but now he is pale and has a sigh of relief Look. Talis and the guards can definitely hear the anomalies here no matter where they are in the church. It will take half a minute to get over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that these tens of seconds are all his own life to fight back. This method of relying on a large amount of blood loss in an instant to resist this deadly blood-sucking weapon is not seen in any magician's caste, but by his own deep understanding of white magic and necromantic magic, as well as the decision and judgment of life and death. The way I came up with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the failure of this assassination had the cause of the assassination’s own minor mistakes, the biggest reason to be admitted was the strength of the Cardinal himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time Asa has screamed on the ground. At the same time as the screaming screams, his hands are constantly lit with white magic light. This is the purification of white magic. Although he can't practice other magical spells because of meditation. But the most basic white magic of purifying and healing is used in his hands no less than the pastor of the church. It’s just that the white magic that was originally used for other curses and magical effects, such as ice and water, has no effect on the severe pain that has spread to the whole body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s amazing to be able to use magical Escher for this person. In such a close distance, there is no defense in the ground. He is full of this mental impact. Even Lancelot can never protect the sobriety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this kid is not confused even if he can use the magic of Escher. This mental impact is almost the essence of all his mental magic and the way magical magic works is originally different from the magic of other systems. The scattering of white magic is almost ineffective. Don't say that this kid's half-hanging white magic is not so easy to lift even if the Pope is in person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that although these magical powers have all been sent to Asa's body, they still have a subtle connection with the Cardinal's own consciousness. Asher’s thoughts on the curse locked the Asa that rolled on the ground like a fish thrown on a soldering iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa does not know that the only thing he knows is that he is crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All can feel the pain. The itch and the disgusting nerves and sensations are working hard. The various hallucinations constantly generate mutual catastrophic illusions in the mind and the pain guides each other and catalyzes almost all of the consciousness. All the thoughts of all the feelings are like a group of drenched mice madly confused and upside down in consciousness. He feels that he almost uses his stomach to breathe his nose and listen to his ears. He will immediately bite his throat with his eyes and eat it in his thumb. Then he will digest it through the bones and turn it into a mass of meat. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he can still 'feel' himself crazy. That means he is not crazy. The most central point in thinking is still to be clear and to work hard to mobilize all possible power in the body to dispel the magic in the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fourth purification failed, he seemed to hear a strange whisper. The original frenzied consciousness immediately began to be more frenzied. That clear-cut point has already been drowned by mad thoughts. He can even anticipate that after his madness, the first reaction is to bite off his hand and then turn to Jessica Yabin, who is stiff on the ground, and the madness. The little girl peeled open and grabbed together. Shredded and swallowed...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his own sea of ​​consciousness, he can almost see himself falling into a bloody madness mire... Everything that can be seen at the foot of the ground is all that fleshy and fuzzy, upside down, fuzzy, flesh-and-blood, bloody mold... killing violent dead flesh and blood viscera ** bloody violent dead inside killing...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just after he was completely sunk, he finally gathered all the power to find a strong fulcrum. He finally extended the little clarity to all consciousness with dark meditation. . Although there is still no way to dispel the mental magic that is closely related to the cardinal consciousness, he can finally get rid of the illusion of consciousness and rediscover the feeling of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the body trembled a little in this loud drink, Asa finally released his hands with his head down. He jumped up and looked up and stared at Ashur's eyes with a blood red. Not only the eyes, but also the corners of the nose and even the blood of his eyes all flowed out of his ears. If he was not standing still, he was completely smashed with fresh corpses by a slap in the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aescher’s face is astonished. He feels that the magic he has sent into this opponent’s body has not been dispelled but has been surrounded. In his consciousness, he rushed to do whatever he wanted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looks at the Cardinal. This opponent is now leaning against the wall and the face is pale and the paper is so white that the large pieces of blood on the body are also bleak. Such a dying old man almost made him worse than a dog. He suddenly started to punch out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One click. The sound of the bones breaking in the muscles sounds like a large amount of fried beans perched through a cloth bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa can feel the muscles and bones of his left arm immediately mixed into a group under his own punch. He is more surprised than this huge pain. In any case, he did not understand why he should have turned the head of the cardinal into a mass of meat, why he would fall on his own three arms. If it’s not vague, I’ve put a part of the grudge. I’m afraid this fist has already let my left hand fly out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps and shouts of Talis and the guards are vaguely reversible. Asa was shocked and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to escape this is the last chance. But if you want to kill this is the last chance. Escape or kill? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aescher still relies on the wall to be mad at him. It seems that as long as someone has poked his finger on it, he can kill the seriously injured old man. He made a strange posture at this time. Stretched out his fingers and pointed at Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just pointed out that nothing else has been done. Although the gray scorpions did not look good because of blood loss and injury, they did not panic and fear, but instead had a cat-like mouse-like glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the cardinal’s vision inexplicably murderous and angry immediately violently in his chest. He roared. A boxing out... hit in. This fist hits his chest and immediately sends out two crisp bone breaks. He flew down and knocked down the Abin, who had been there for half a time. The two rolled together on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A blood spurted out of the mouth. Asa looked at her fist incredulously. What he was surprised at was not that the body did not listen to it, but that the fist was indeed that he had commanded his own arm and punched it. Just when his murderous anger pointed to the Cardinal's clenching fist and immediately vented his anger and murderousness, the target of his consciousness suddenly became himself. Asa remembers that it is clear that he is arrogant to himself when he throws the punch. It is true that he is really true and even has a kind of idea that he decided to fight this fight ten years ago. Get the thrill of what you want. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have more than half of my mental power in your mind. Do you think that you want to completely suppress it with your temper? Even if you can't let you Crazy but to distort your awareness of the attack is still possible." Aescher gently coughed his face and twitched. Although the wound just wrapped in all his white magical power is not fatal, the pain caused by each of the most subtle movements is so bitter. But even then he still pointed his finger at the Asa on the ground, although this action may have been the only action he can do now with all his strength. "Although I don't dare to use white magic, but the manipulation has already used magic, I can still get it. As long as you have hostility, anger and murder, I can let you kill yourself to your body."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messy footsteps on the stairs sounded that the guards had arrived. One of the fastest-paced footsteps was the sound of the steel knight of the Knights Knight knight on the marble surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think that real meditation can make you use magic when my mind rushes in. Unfortunately, now you use magic and use mental magic. It won't be dispelled." Although Aescher is still weak, but the face of the serious face of the bloody body is even if it is weak and powerful, it is a bit weak and serious. "You can rest assured. I will not hand you over to Magnus. I will look for a chance to bring you back to the Descartes Valley. There must be some interest in living anatomy."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
