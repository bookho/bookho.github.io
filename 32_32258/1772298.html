			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fate? He suddenly remembered this terrible idea. He recalled a conversation with Bishop Ronis at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this is already already scheduled, no matter what you do, the end result is all that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is fate, do you believe it? What method do you want to treat? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, he answered the words of Bishop Ronis, but it was because of the relaxed attitude of watching. It’s time for him to have been in this whirlpool for so long, even after he has become part of this whirlpool, and then<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly felt this concept. The feeling of having it is only exhausted and desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your own birth is a small ambiguity in this whirlpool, so much effort and struggle, and there is hope<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope, does it make sense? So, Asa asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your life?" Aier’s mother smiled, even though her face had a lot of wrinkles, but this laugh still<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very beautiful. "Isn't your life already clear? You are just the son of a blacksmith in the village."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stunned, thought about it, opened big Laugh: "Ha ha ha...., what you said is. I am just a blacksmith's child<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child is gone."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the rough scratch on the surface of the ring that was originally polished like a jade, where there was originally <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A mark, but it has been rubbed off his father's tombstone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know it. Ok, let's take it out. I knew it when I felt the breath two days ago<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You brought me to come with me." Ai's mother sighed. "Shandro's things taken from Diya Valley that year.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hilt of the Dark Star."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled a bit: "Really, when I saw this thing in the cellar for the first time, I heard that Sandru actually said this <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I took the artifact of Diya Valley, I was really shocked. I couldn’t think of him being able to take the Ghost’s robe.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the pocket, it is also poured into the well water of the sun well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai’s mother’s finger is the ring that has been worn on Asa’s body, and the hands are caught. With the pocket that Asa brought,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She whispered, "How are you ready?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa nodded, his face was very dignified. There was also a slight sweat on the forehead. The glare of his hands has been <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lighted to the limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Ai's mother-in-law snorted, her hands suddenly became a ghost, and she was tied like a twist.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pocket was unlocked in an instant, then she gently hit the bottom of the bag with one hand and soaked in the sun well water.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;West flies out with a huge darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but just flew out of the bag. Asa’s hand has already taken this thing. The white temperament is as dignified as a mountain, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole breath that was about to be filled immediately is wrapped up. At the same moment, Aier’s mother-in-law holds the ring<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Ai's mother sighed and gestured to Asa to let go. The thing that has been soaked in the sun well water<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fall in her hands. This is a dark and irregular cylinder, like the texture of the stone, and there is no such thing as <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are superb craftsmanship, even the surface is somewhat irregular The pits seem to be just like a small piece of black scorpion<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ring has been placed on the finest tail of the cylinder, and <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is often embedded in it. The lingering weather that was originally unbridled and diffused is no longer distributed outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It became a group of black mist that was visible around the object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sacred object of the Diya Valley. The hilt of the Dark Star that represents the Darkness and Death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cylindrical object is held in the hand, and Aier’s mother’s eyes reveal a little excitement, she is long<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighing with a sigh: "I can't think of it, I can't think of it, it's just a black-skinned hilt, but five hundred years<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first person who can hold it completely in his hand. It is me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five hundred years, dreaming, trying to pull up The person who puts the legendary sword is not too much, but can have <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;qualified to be the dream person. All of them were the most powerful, or the most capable, strong, and this is not only strength, but also countless on the star of the darkness<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dreams and ambitions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holding the hilt, Ayr’s mother seems to be somewhat ecstatic. Her eyes are sometimes embarrassing, sometimes flashing. Even if she never had <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ambitions and dreams, but almost everything she has around her dreams and ambitions. This <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a dark amount almost represents the whole of her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling that you can hold things that have decided your life. No one can be indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are so many people who have died, so much effort has been made, and there are so many changes in the situation, in fact, it is for <br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing is all." Ai's mother-in-law looked at the hilt of her hand and smiled. Although the ring can transform the power of the hilt<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, but her hand still maintains a shallow vindictiveness to hold this thing. "This thing is <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? Desire? Or....What.....?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The person who is determined by this thing is not only her, she also understands that there are other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but is this life in your own hands, or is there really something like fate that dominates? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly wants to try. In fact, she has been trying all the time. From twenty years ago, she stood in a Diya Valley.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person should have a position while she Just try. Now that things have reached this point, it should be somewhat clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, do you want to take a hospital stay and try it?" Ai's mother-in-law suddenly looked at Asa smiling, and she reached out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the prophecy of Lord Akibad, it has been said that people who have gathered strength can pull out the dark stars and become a change<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world's world is dominant. Do you want to try the feeling of the world's dominance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
