			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of Bishop Rooney was placed in the cathedral by the priests. From the beginning of the present to the present, the white magic that was added to the priests who were hurting him was enough to treat a thousand dying people. But the horrible blood hole on the neck and the knife that almost reached the heart on the vest have been turned into a pale blue blood by poison and strong curse. These are all strongly stated that this respected old man has really died completely, even if he has 10,000 times more magical power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is he?" Roland’s head was slender with a pair of slender eyebrows. The appearance of the first swordsman of this empire did not have the fortitude and sharpness of any warrior, but now the light shining in the twin stars is better than any famous sword. Looking at the terrible scars and blood on the body of Bishop Ronis, his voice and body trembled slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All of us outside have seen it." An old pastor whispered with tears. The old priests who are now in the cathedral are all in tears and grief to the extreme. There is a cry outside the cathedral. Bishop Roones has been in the Magic Academy for more than 40 years and can be said that the status of the School of Magic in the Empire is now established by him. Everyone in the School of Magic has revered the old man and even in many people's minds he is simply the embodiment of God. But he is now being assassinated by despicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head of Roland did not ask again. At that time, there were at least a hundred clerics at the outer cathedral. They all dared to swear in the name of God that the priest was covered in blood and rushed out from here to knock down several people and flew out of the Magic Academy. There are no more confirmations for so many devout witnesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have seen this in the study." A pastor took out the overnight order that Cuesbert had carefully prepared. It was already bloodstained. . But the portraits and words are still clear enough to explain everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke who has never spoken on the side is already sorrowful and sad, and does not let the pastors. He suddenly asked: "Is there anything strange about the recent bishops?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old pastor immediately realized: "Right. Two days ago Bishop Rooney had been there before, but the spy was not there at the time. The bishop was only talking about the old man in the middle of the body and guarding the body. I seem to hear the bishop being angry. Then when the bishop came out, I Seeing that his face is very bad, he has been boring for the past two days... The result is such a thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the Duke’s adult has been a little bit sorrowful Not vocal but more grief. "We must seize the bastards of the Necromancers as soon as possible." He screamed very hard: "Revenge for the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke of the Duke Sorrow and anger immediately infected the people around. The souls of the old pastors who had already dried up were finally provoked by hatred. "All the magicians of the Magic Academy must avenge the bishops."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So let's think about it now. Think carefully." In his extreme sorrow, his delicate thinking is still analyzed in a slow and clear tone. "Think about the usual act of the traitor and the suspicious traces of the act."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pastor flies into the cathedral. He went to the palace to pass the blame to the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" The sorrowful bishop has been crying and stunned several times. His Majesty has already ordered the Paladin to investigate the murderer and all the cults associated with the Necromancer. All the killings of the paradox. The imperial edict is coming soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geffenhart XVII is the bishop of Ronnie who looks to grow up for him This respected old man is almost his grandfather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s face condensed like ice and slowly nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dashan Zhongshan Drew is smashing the body as usual, but today I don’t know why he always feels diminished today. At this time, footsteps came from outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hidden door was knocked down by two soldiers and walked in to take the lead in knowing the king of the King of the Guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sandra's old magic school has an accident." The expression of the little head is a little weird and the taste is a bit unspeakable to Sandru. "We have something to ask you. Let's take a trip with us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing. Just ask you to have a cup of tea and chat." The little leader answered. His expressions and voices are lingering together. It is obvious that the strength of the milk is used to create a very relaxed atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relatively speaking, the expressions of the three soldiers seem to be much more natural. Just as the little leader and Sandro spoke, they were slowly walking towards Sandru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drinking tea? Speaking of it, you seem to owe me money. The last time you went to **..." Sandro seems to have no I feel that something is wrong and the little head talks about the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three soldiers have intentionally or unconsciously walked to the side of Sandro. Two of them slammed into one hand of the old man. And the third person has more sputum with a dark red luster on his hand. This is a ban on magic used by the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three soldiers’ movements are as fast as they are without any cleverness like three leopards who have been waiting in the grass for a long time. The timing of their shots and the position of their respective stations are also matched with just the right division of labor. It is also clear that there are only long-term exercises and countless practices that can be tempered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a sudden and perfect match, even a good swordsman can only be awkward. But this old man who seems to have no spirit is just taking a step back and easily grasping the two wrists that he wanted to catch him have already fallen into his hands. He then pulled two bodies in his body that were much bigger than him. He immediately slammed into the two people who were so strong and powerful. Under this collision, they immediately began to soften their bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third rushing soldier is not in the blink of an eye. He has already reacted and pulled the sword up and slammed in one go. Such a quick response is such an agile action. Even the highest commander of the Wang Duwei Guardian does not have such a skill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s a pity that his beautiful sword has not stabbed his wrist and inexplicably has fallen into the hands of the white and dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When is your man more than the Paladin? Is it promoted?" Shandru’s eyes were still half-closed and his head was still small. It is still like the tone of chatting in the teahouse. It was only one of his hands that had smashed the volley of the soldier who was much stronger than himself. The contrast of the figure made him look like a monkey who was licking a bear easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little leader has not answered and has fallen to the ground. He seemed to have no strength to stand up, no hands and feet squatting backwards and moving his eyes and looking straight at Sandro. Because Sander not only picked up such a samurai swordsman but also was jealous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the swordsman died, I don’t know. The tall and strong body is now just like cotton-filled, not only being swayed by the old man in his hands, but also deformed under the grip of the dry hands. There was something else on his armor that fell into pieces and was constantly folded and moved, and soon became a round meat mass in the hands of Sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you also coming to invite me to drink tea?" Shandrew looked coldly at the door and waved the huge meatball that the swordsman had changed. The man who just came in at the door flew away. This huge hidden weapon is now in the air, the sound of the wind and thunder proves that its weight is actually amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This meatball also sprinkled some black juice when flying forward, one of which just flew to the small head on the ground. The animal-like misery of the small-headed head was only half-sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who just appeared at the door stepped back in front of the line and flashed like a glimpse. Then the meatball was neatly divided into two sides from the middle. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good." Sandro’s screaming sound seemed to be weak, but the eyes that had been dead and dead finally shone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason he called good is not because the meatball was split in two. After the two hemispheres were neatly separated, they did not fall or continue to fly toward the front but rolled in the opposite direction and slammed into the walls on the left and right sides. The juice containing the poisonous magic only eroded two large holes on the walls on both sides and did not touch the person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sword is not just the flying of the flesh ball itself, but also the magical power contained in the juice splashed with the rolling air. There is also a momentum of inertia that flies over. Everything about this meatball is divided into two under the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeared at the door is a middle-aged man of forty or fifty years old. He has a refined and elegant face. Even such a serious and dignified expression can't see any majestic murder under his five senses. If it weren't for the set of magical glimmers and the squirting sword in his hand, he seemed to be just a scholar who was full of poetry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you good? So you have to ask me to have tea?" Shandru answered with a voice and stood up for the first time. Kneeling body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. I am here to catch you or to kill you." The words of the people are as direct as the sword he had just made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out to be the case." The sound of the squeaky bones blew out from all parts of Sandre's body. With these sounds his body grew almost a circle. "Unfortunately, I never like being caught by people and I don't like being killed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I never like nonsense." The sound of the long sword screams in every inch of space in the big house. "We are starting to get to the point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the big house. At the 300 meters, an old priest frowned and asked the Duke of Mulak: "Did the Duke of the Lord exaggerate this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. Deal with those evil deaths. The Master must be careful and go all out.” The Duke’s face was hard to find without a gentle and friendly smile. A dignified look and slender eyes stared at the big house in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But be careful not to use this." The old pastor looked at the front that seemed to be a bit exaggerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of hundreds of Paladins outside the big house formed an encirclement. Behind them are the priests and magicians of almost all magic schools. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man of Sandru, who has been working hard to discuss the analysis, has fallen into the eyes of everyone. Although this old man has been in the Magic Academy for 20 years and the bishop seems to be familiar with him, but with the spoiled car, it is enough to explain how the people of the Necromancer are pervasive. And the traitor didn't have to add the eccentricity of the old man to the old man before he studied in the Magic College. There are enough reasons for this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending scouts to investigate, the old man is still there. So I decided to take him to investigate first. If there is resistance, it is a killing paradox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is of course carried out by the head of Roland, who is under the command of the Emperor. No one disagreed with the strength of the first swordsman of the empire. However, the Duke indicated that he was a cautious person who was a high-ranking person. He suggested that the head of the Roland team should bring more people and call the priests of the School of Magic to come together. If the old man is really a Necromancer, then everyone can give Luo. The Bishop of Nice took revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The head of Roland has been in this for a long time. I have seen that most people have already caught the people and are searching." The old pastor looked at the combat power and could definitely attack. The encirclement of the next city is really a bit wrong. The magicians of the School of Magic actually went out of their nests and watched it like watching the excitement. Everyone is separated from the big house. Although everyone can't see it, it is definitely ok. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly there was a strange sound like a broken cloth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big house is divided into two from the center and then splits at the waist. The two walls and the roof slowly fell to the sides and provoked the dust of the sky. The broken place was neat and smooth like a knife. Looking farther from here, it seems that a delicate toy has been slashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of the Paladin did not make any sounds or movements. But the magician pastors of the School of Magic screamed and screamed in no doubt as loud as the walls and roofs. Such a power must be able to come out of the head of Roland. The move is undoubtedly to show that it is really a Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person in the dust smog flew out and came to the front of the encirclement is the head of Roland. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, contrary to the striking scene just now, the head of the Roland team was a cockroach and almost stood still. A face of the original thin Wenjun has been full of anger and surprise and not only the skin that is exposed on the outside of the face, but also the kind of disgusting gray of the corner of the toilet. He has been poisoned and cursed and is still extremely powerful. If he is replaced by other people, he is already a carrion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
