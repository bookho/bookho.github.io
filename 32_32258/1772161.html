			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the knight has always used only seven points of combat power, the sword is already twelve points. This is the real full blow. Every movement is sending all the power to the tip of the sword. The strengths and fighting spirits that have gathered together have reached the perfect peak. The enemy has retreated and cannot be repelled. She will solve this opponent with this steep and full blow. It’s not because this person’s insult to her is not just the weapon that squanders evil. It’s not because this person is the most powerful among these people because of the strange feeling in the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of card is the horsewoman who does not want to go deeper. As long as the person is dead, there is no need to have any cards. Now that this opponent has stood up and is not stable, she has seized the opportunity and she has fully attacked at this moment. She has absolute confidence that this sword can hide this opponent and him in the back of the card that can't be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pace of the man’s jealousy was a little steady and he immediately went all out to dodge. But the horsewoman's sword followed suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The masonry under the footsteps has broken the temperament and magical light to make her healthy figure shine like a god. The front of the body rushes almost parallel to the ground. People are already part of the sword's qi, such as the tens of thousands of horses rushing to the mountains and screaming into the tsunami. The ground beneath her was even cracked under the power of this sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The onlookers can only see the moment of the figure and the sword in the dazzling white light. All the people who see it have an illusion, even the sword. Or to puncture the entire basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Solution" A clear drink suddenly pulled up flat. The sound of this steep voice is bright and natural, and it is incompatible with the battlefield full of blood and killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is the handsome young man who asked for gold coins from Helicika. From the beginning of the battle, he pulled out his sword and stood still. I only watched a few companions in front and the horsewoman was hard to find. The battle was too fierce. Ai Sisi and other bandits were also dazzled and completely ignored the lazy ‘master’. The skinny man, who was taken away by Helicia and who could only blink at the side, saw that he thought he was not fighting enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when everyone almost forgot him, he suddenly took the sword in his hand to the female knight to make this sound clear. Just as he was drinking, the long sword actually flashed the same white light as the horsewoman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white light on the sword slammed. The white light on the horsewoman disappeared immediately. What followed was the body of the horsewoman. The sword that was so fierce and undressed was so abruptly stopped. The interruption was inexplicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Purification?" behind Aisi and the female knight screamed in unison. The difference is that the sound of Ai Sisi is a surprise and the female knight is horrified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This white magic level attached to the Glorious Battlegear is extremely high and is fully immune to other systems because of the combination of the attributes of the Glorious Battlegear and the unique temperament of the Knights of the Knights. Dispel magic and curse. But the purifying spells that are also white magic can be immune through this layer. Not only is this magical power of the simple purification magic spelled. Obviously the user condenses all the magic power on this dispelling spell like a bucket of ice water poured over the fire. The ‘天之佑’ that can be moved once a day on the Glorious Battlegear is cleaned up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly lost more than a dozen kinds of auxiliary magic power, agile reaction all fell into a mess, the energy of the body like a big river was also drove off as a gate. Needless to say, the sword continued to stab, and even the station almost did not stand firm and lost its balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika Druid and the woman in black and the sword in the eyes of the man burst into the light. It was the eyes that were fighting with the beasts but sneaked into the deadly weakness of the beast. Almost with the instinct of the four-man mad female knight who had just been forced to retreat, the body that was out of balance and the space was wide open. Even the skinny man pulled out a small cockroach and pulled it up. Only the man who had to avoid the attack had just jumped to the wall. It’s too late to come over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This purification magic is very simple without mourning the mantra, but it is not a very skillful technique in the dark. But this time it has become a twisting battle. trump card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every attack before the Templars is only a seven-point force. This is the most correct tactic, no matter what kind of changes you encounter, there is room for turning and dodging defense. Therefore, this young man did not rush to shoot. When he waited for the female knight to think that he was winning, he only made a full blow. Only the moment of full attack was the most undefended moment. The moment of the moment was a fatality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boxing swords and swords, short swords, and thin men and women's shackles and werewolves, Druid's claws, a few weapons have not yet brought out the wind, the sound of the horsewoman has been violently fluttering with a sharp whistling with bloodthirsty The impulse went straight to the horsewoman's golden head and the white neck and went to the place where there was no armor and it was absolutely deadly. As long as these weapons have a poke in the head of the horsewoman, they will immediately be broken like watermelon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no white magician assisted loss of the female knight in this one-and-a-half moment, with half of the flocks on her own A few of the weapons that had to break her head were mostly hit on her back and pulled a few sparks and dents on the shining armor. A fist sword and a skull were rubbed from her head and neck. Bring a piece of silk and blood to fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the horsewoman’s foot is also supported by Druid’s chest. This foot of the Emperor has nothing to do with the slightest damage to the wolf's solid rock-like chest, but the horsewoman turned to the front and turned to the volley. It was only in this blink of an eye that she had recovered from a state of complete unpreparedness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several attackers have to be acknowledged. From this dodge between the millennium and one can be seen that even if it is not a terrible addition of white magic, the instinctive reaction of the knight's hand and battle is indeed unparalleled. It is impossible to kill her by the weapons in her own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they can’t but represent no one else. A strange and huge wind came from behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same mountain-like giant sword. What came out was a mountain crash. Just look at the four people in front of this power, subconsciously avoiding both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika is a step slower than the four. Not because he is bulky, but his body is huge but it is as sensitive and fast as a cat. He even saw that the first thing that responded when the young man's purification spells came into effect was slower than the four. The reason was that he stood up and took a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone can hear the sound of breathing like a giant whale swelling and then the muscles of the whole body of Shelikah are getting bigger. The muscles that had been bulged one by one were so strong that the skin was stretched. It seems that the balloon will explode as soon as it is full of gas. He originally looked like a muscle fortress and now is a fortress-like muscle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to this variant, Helicia has no madness, loses reason, and slams up. It is a dignified face like a child who just learned swordsmanship. The high-spirited sword rushes forward to a standard that is like a textbook-style faint light and extends to the giant sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drug" Druid four people exclaimed. This is the ability that only soldiers who have a true understanding of martial arts can integrate their fighting spirit and combat experience into their lives and souls. I don’t think that this kind of shackles that seem to be violent and bloodthirsty like beasts will have such a state of nowhere. What is even more unexpected is that he did not need to show his true combat power until this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sword is not as fast as lightning. But it is enough to avoid this when the knight is still standing still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the mighty female knight facing this sword has changed. She bit her hand and pressed her hand on her chest for a while. The white light was stronger than she had just now. She was on her body and her brilliance armor. A sapphire on the left arm broke the broken gem. The dazzling light was in her moment. On the left arm, a shield made up of light is formed to meet the stabbing sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the highest protection magic of the Glorious Battlegear ‘Holy Guardian’ is the defense of the last knight of each shrine. She must now harden this sword. But suddenly her body shook her eyes and the light shield on her arm immediately dimmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next to the Axis, the old man with a magical voice lying on the ground laughed like a big mouse that had just stolen the kitten. His whole body is still smoking and his eyebrows are gone. But he still had no weird staff in his hand pointing at the horsewoman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not suffer any fatal damage under that light arrow magic but he did not dare to get up. The Knights of the Temple had almost no immunity to his magical magic, so he couldn't shake it. He also waited for the best time with the young man. It was only his eyesight and reaction that was too far from the young man to catch up with the same opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But fortunately this timing is not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
