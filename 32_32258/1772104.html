			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Airy has reported that the pagan organization there is increasingly asking the church to send people to deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the aftermath of the vampire incident, these strange things are caged with a horrible shadow as if you can kill the overwhelming zombie ghost at any time. . All the officials, especially the nerves of the emperor's arm, were stretched like a tight string, and the slightest change immediately made a loud noise. In this case, anything related to any pagan or something monster is of course to ask the clergy to exorcise evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing of course falls on Asa’s head. First, because the emperor's trust is the recommendation and operation of Bishop Ronis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Ronis immediately called Asa to the School of Magic to arrange tasks for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After your last hunting, I once revealed to the great priests the intention to promote you to the position of a great priest, but they are not in favor, especially Cous Burt is even more opposed. But it's no wonder that their position has been working hard in the School of Magic for so many years. It's really unacceptable to see that you are so young and unqualified, but you can be on an equal footing with them immediately. I can Directly promote you as a priest but promote to a great priest but I need to be recommended together with the three great priests to the Holy See."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So this is your good opportunity. The Alien's pagans are so bad that it seems that it is more appropriate for you to deal with this matter because of the whispering of the whisper. If you can cleanly deal with those infidels, then I recommend you to be a great priest. People can no longer refute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa secretly frowns just now that this priest is doing it all and feels troublesome. Adding a 'big' word in front is really true. It’s a bit too much to eat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you are a great priest, I can showdown with the elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about those guys?" Asa almost forgot these guys. The only thing that was still impressed was the elf girl who was almost killed by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably now the king is the only one in the big 6 who has not wanted you. I have called the following people to take yours from the Adventurers Guild and the Thieves Guild. The wanted order was collected and notified to them to ban the acceptance of your wanted." Bishop Ronis took out more than a dozen portraits of Asa from the drawer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa picked up a portrait for the first time to see his wanted order. The elves' hands are very clever and the lines are very delicate. Just like the best way to outline his appearance, Asa can't help but nod his head and admire: "It's very good to draw at least better than me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as your identity can be recognized by the Holy See. At that time, the elves' all night is equal to one waste paper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church of Light Compared with the elves, the influence is simply a giant beast and a bunny. Even if the elves took out all their pitiful possessions as a bounty to go through a church, the great sergeant adventurer and the bounty hunter would rather go straight to robbery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I can then suggest to the elves to let them join our alliance, then they are not allowed to accept it. According to their nature, it was originally disdainful. Human beings join hands. But you are indispensable to them. If you can't catch you, you can only help you to stand with you. And with the participation of the elves, our strength is mostly combined with the surrounding countries and empires. Asking the church to support us to deal with the Necromancer Church can no longer be ignored."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh this way." Asa nodded though complicated but finally figured out . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because this mission is very important, I intend to let Rodhart go with you to help you with this task."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Is he already back?" Asa had not seen him for a while. Although it is true that a friend is born and died together, Asa always feels that he does not have a good relationship with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has been quite good at dealing with pagans in other places during this time. This is a very capable and promising young man who can help you a lot. It’s busy. You have to solve the problem of the local officials and imperial ministers who were killed by the pagans in the last time. You can add a political capital to you.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course I know." Bishop Ronis smiled inexplicably. “It’s not easy to find it, but you can make it out. Anyway, the pagans there find so many suitable objects to make the right stories and evidences. That’s a great achievement.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh it turns out." Asa nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not very suitable to arrange for these things. I will talk to Rod Hart to let him arrange it." Bishop Roones frowned Looking at Asa and asking: "What happened to you? I feel like you have been very absent-minded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No... probably a little tired. Anyway, you are detailed. It’s OK to talk to Rod Hart. I have to go ahead.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Bishop Ronis, Asa came directly to the library’s data room. He is more interested in something compared to the plan of Bishop Ronis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it was painful to find the afternoon and turn over the shoulder from noon. Asa only found three times in the thick file and record 'Ved Nina. Finhart's name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not mean that all three are recorded in the roster of the School of Magic. The name is as inconspicuous as other countless names, just to show that the School of Magic has indeed had this person. Other information explaining what kind of experience this person has done here has not been found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, a person who was once a glorious magic school student and later changed to a lich was never obscured. Probably this only shows that most of her information in the School of Magic has been deleted. It is indeed not a memorable thing that the student has become a Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa closed the dusty book and shook his sore neck and arm. I came to the library data room to see what kind of strange classmates were in the past who were unimagined but not disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the 20-year period is not a long time ago, it should be known that there are many people in the Magic Academy who have white wrinkles to see him and respectfully bow. But Asa did not dare to ask questions. This may be a taboo topic for the School of Magic. If you ask someone indiscriminately, it would be a hassle to report to Bishop Ronis. Things about Vidnina always seem to make the bishop adults very allergic. If you let him know that the dangerous classmate had contacted him and invited him to join the club, the lightest result was a long lesson and persuasion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But curiosity is scratched and caught in the heart like a cat that can’t be quiet. At this critically uncomfortable time, the Marquis appeared in the data room. He came to Bishop Ronis and he was ready to go out for two days and then went on a trip with Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa immediately realized that this is definitely a very suitable question. The Marquis was also a famous figure at the School of Magic twenty years ago and it seems that he is not a person who will tell the bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you know the name?" The Marquis looked at him with amazement after listening to Asa’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa replied casually: "Well, I only heard that it was a very interesting person. So I came here to check but I couldn’t find it. You know her. What's the situation? Help me tell me a good one?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis did not answer but just sighed. This expression is very rare for him who is full of energy and aura. He walked over and searched the bookshelf for a book from a dense bookcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the cover, this is just the usual subject of the theological books of the School of Magic. The thick dust on the book indicates that no one has read it for many years. The Marquis blows off the dust and turns over an illustration of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illustration is a half-naked image of the Madonna. The engraving craftsmen undoubtedly poured a lot of effort and effort on the great image. The kindness and gentleness of Mary's face are vivid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not understand the connection between the Madonna and a lich, but saw the Marquis flipped the illustration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back of the illustration was originally blank because of the respect for the Virgin and did not imprint the typeface on her back. And this originally awesome blank area has a picture. This is a portrait of the back of the woman. It seems that the lines drawn by the pencil charcoal are not very delicate. The paper has also been yellow because of the age. It was just such a painting, but Asa was immediately shocked at first sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those black lines perfectly constitute a woman's beautiful image and charm, and even the ethereal and temperament of carbon ink. There is no slightest place on the white paper. Every trace of idleness is useless. The woman’s style is perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the body is as clear as the classical sculpture. The contours of the face are very clear and the contours of the tenderness are like water. The long scatter is spread out and the back is clearly rough. The charcoal pen can feel the soft and smooth luster. These beautiful places are combined with a broader and far-reaching sense of harmony. Anyone can see that there is no way to escape except for shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This beauty is the highest in the world. It can make any man admire the intoxicated woman and has to let the worship and admiration suppress the heart. This painting does not show the woman's positive facial features, but only such a side is enough for all viewers to dump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what I painted 20 years ago when I was young." The eyes of the Marquis were full of youthful glow and cherished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's so beautiful." Asa sighed. He was amazed at the beauty of this woman and admire the Marquis' ability to express such a beautiful hand. Of course, he himself is arrogant about what art he paints, but when he saw the painting, he immediately felt shocked but a little regrettable. "But why don't you look like you can't see the front."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where can I express her peerless shackles? Look at the face." Marquis looked at this young age of the work and even the sound is full of young people's intoxication in the feelings of melancholy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you must have liked this woman very much." Asa nodded and he could feel the feelings of the Marquis in each stroke. Such a peerless beauty is indeed worthy of the genius of the Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I once asked her to marry each of the flowers that I could collect. I used 99,999,999 flowers on the outskirts of Wangdu. There is a saying, 'I love you.'" The two dark, slender eyebrows of the Marquis, the deep, beautiful eyes, the sparkling wine that brewed the memories of the wine, and drunk any woman who dared to look straight. Imagine these eyes and the slightest crow's feet on the corners, and the handsome man who is a little feminine beauty of the Marquis retreats to that young age. Asa even suspects that even many men must be recruited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa shook his head and sighed: "Every flower? 99,999,999? Your spirit is really good enough."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just hate my spirit is not good enough to do this work completely personally. It took almost a national gardener to spend thousands of gold coins in a month. The spelled word must be ran on the horse and run through it to see it clearly. But she just smiled. You know that this smile is what I feel is worth it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa was shocked in this romance of legend and poetry. In the 20 years ago, Shenchi went to experience the face of the peerless beauty and the same peerless courtship of the Marquis. The meeting finally remembered what had been asked. "But what does this beauty have to do with Vaderina? Is it because it is the beauty of her classmate who killed her or ruined her?" According to the identity of Vedina, Asa subconsciously came up with this sinister inference of committing a crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis’s words are very gentle: “The person on this painting is that she is the classmate of the Magic Academy 20 years ago. Na. Geffhardt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The occlusal muscles at the mouth completely lost control. Asa opened his mouth and couldn’t close his eyes. Falling down with the tongue chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa feels that his brain has become the kind of miscellaneous boiled in Oufucheng. It’s thick and sticky, but it’s strong but slippery. What is the taste. The two extreme impressions can no longer be combined with the power of reason. It is impossible to connect such a beautiful and unparalleled woman with the ugly ugly horror that can only be said to be horrible and disgusting. He used to smear her mask in the whispering sorrow to see her sullen half of her face, and now the side of the painting is really so beautiful and thrilling. On one side, the angel in the red world is a living evil spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Marquis looked at his over-expressed expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa tried his best to control his mind and words and asked: "What happened to this person in the future? Why did you never hear anything? Have someone like her only found a name on the record of the Academy of Magic without any information?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead? How did you die?" Asa asked. However, he knew that it should not be dead and probably became a lich to join the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not very clear. I just heard that she was dead when I came back from the Sandefies. Bishop Ronis announced that she was offended by the School of Magic. The taboo arbitrarily went to a test of the curse method. The experiment failed. She died. The consequences of that experiment were very serious. I remember that even the cathedral was completely ruined. Half of the buildings of the School of Magic became ruins and many people died. In order to take into account the reputation of the church and the royal family, Bishop Ronis and the emperor of the time destroyed all her information and prohibited the ban from talking about anything about this person."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa suddenly remembered the sigh that Bishop Ronis had once sighed and sighed a man who went astray. It turned out that that person is her. But the reasons and processes are not known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa asked: "What do you do to run to the Sandefies at that time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going to find a poison dragon flower that can only be opened there. It is the most beautiful flower on the big 6 legend. I only want to marry this flower and no girl is impressed."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There you going to get it"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She said these flowers after seeing the countless flowers I prepared for her There are countless people in the world who have been handcuffed by others. I want to see the legendary poison dragon flower, so I went to the Sandefies to find it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa couldn't help but sigh: "In order to marry a woman alone, I can only say that you have a problem with your head."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sandefes is the most dangerous area in the Big 6. Even the bipedal dragons and the wild cows are full of poisonous lizard swamps and there is a good mountain and water. Even the top 6 travellers and adventurers don't dare to get involved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Through the wilderness of the Highlands into the Sandefes and looking for a total of nearly a year, I almost died in the middle but still let me finally find I took the flower. I took the flower and used it to seal it in the ice. But when I returned to the School of Magic, I only saw the wreckage of the land and didn’t even hear her body. After she died, I was in the ruins for three days. The flower that lost the ice protection was exposed in this worldly air and completely withered in my arms..." The Marquis was silent in the last memory. Speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa also silenced half with the Marquis because half of the resounding resentment against the Marquis was because there was a strong thought in mind now. The send reel left to him by Ved Nina is still in the big house of Sandro. He wants to go to Deya Valley to see this legendary classmate ask her exactly what makes her want to give up the beautiful choice. Become an undead monster that is not qualified for ugliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Marquis knows that she is not dead but what kind of reaction will it be to become a lich? Asa couldn't help but glance at the Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis's expression immersed in the memory is not sad. It has become more sad than a dead emptiness and awkwardness. He said softly for a while, "Goodbye, I am leaving." Turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at his back, Asa pressed down and urged him to tell him the truth. Maybe he doesn't know that he is the best for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the big house Asa hesitated for a while, but did not go to take the scroll but asked Sandru: "You know Widney before becoming a lich Na?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knowing." Sander nodded half-deadly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then tell me why she will come to the Necromancer to become a lich..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Sandro’s eyes suddenly lifted up and looked at Asa. There was nothing in the black-and-white scorpion that had a fascinating brilliance, but it was just that I saw Asa immediately and unconsciously shut up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am now more and more annoyed by your kid to inquire about what others are doing?" Sandro’s face and tone are not as strict as peacetime. No difference, but Asa feels very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
