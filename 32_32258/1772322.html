			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of the blizzard still ravages the space of the cave, but the wind that blows the eagle and the magic eye is like this wind, Mild like a willow wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hurricane was just formed, and the stalagmites that were shot by magic were shot. But even these huge objects of nearly a thousand pounds have no slight feeling of calmness and thickness in front of this hurricane. They are actually blown away from the original trajectory by the rotating wind. The slightly weaker parts of the stalagmites are in custom. Crush in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roller Rebius stalagmites came a little late, but fortunately this slow half-step, she did not hit this face in vain Hurricane barrier. With this hurricane blowing the momentum of stalagmites, she can blow her into a pile of meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sylvia looked at the hurricane that was cast in the scroll, and he certainly saw this as a hurricane shield in the air spell. It’s just that this defensive magic, which should have just been used to break the ordinary arrow, now looks at least ten times stronger than the regular one. This out of the conventional magic scroll requires a lot of energy and time of the top element magician, rare. Even in Celeste, this is not a collection and will not be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the scroll of this division, the power of the fire bomb, the blizzard that covers almost the entire battlefield, these are the top magic scrolls. And it seems that they will not be brought out of Celeste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge bang sound interrupted Sylvia's surprise. Below, a rock with a diameter of about ten meters suddenly broke away from the ground. Like the stalagmites just hit the sky. The same division is a high-level earthen magic bombarded by a boulder, and the quality of the rock that has been bombarded this time is several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this time it’s not just rocks, but also the Tamar Grand Sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tauren Sacrifice is standing on this huge rock that has been inspired by magic. The sacrificial robes have been covered with a thick layer of rock armor, and a pair of scorpions that were originally like a flame are even brighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elements that carry the two people are not flying very fast, but they have already arrived by this huge rock in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just entering the hurricane range, the rock surface began to peel off under the huge wind pressure, and the rock's trajectory was also a glimpse. But the hurricane Aegis is stronger and bigger. You can scrape the arrow and lose hundreds of pounds of rock, but you can't scrape a hill like this. The magical power of the hurricane was originally consumed when the stalagmites were scraped off. The rotation of the airflow was completely blocked by the huge rock and finally stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge rock, although it is affected by the hurricane, can not hit the gas element and the Knights of the Temple, but the Tamar sacrifice can be. He screamed and leaped to the element of qi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although his close combat may not be the opponent of the two Knights of the Temple, but he does not need to fight, he only needs to put them both, at least It is also the one who carries the curse scroll and pulls it down. At this point, he is confident that he can do it himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as long as it falls down, it goes without saying that it is two Knights of the Temple, that is, twenty, and absolutely dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just as he just jumped, the female knight on the element of gas also pulled a reel and flew from him on the rock. When the horsewoman took out a reel and held it in her hand, she saw him jump. This is only about to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tima Grand Sacrifice sees each other when the female knight is in the hands of another magical reel, he has to scream again and again, he is unable to figure this out. How can the Knights of the Temple be so many, so advanced and so fine magic scrolls. But this is just a click. He saw the woman knight's scroll in the hand when he began to recite the mantra, this time his body has been surrounded by a layer of khaki light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anti-magic technique of the soil system is used in his hand, and it is believed that all magic except the curse can be resisted. Therefore, the Tema Grand Sacrifice did not hesitate to rush to the Knights of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his body just left the rock and felt his heels tight. The forward shape was immediately slow. He turned back and saw one of the giant rock giants grabbing their feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rock is originally filled with the earth magic power of the Tima Grand Sacrifice, so this summoning summoning spell is especially effective and effective. This earth element giant is not only separated from the rock very quickly, but also large enough, even higher than the original Tama Grand Sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tima Grand Sacrifice is very powerful before jumping. But even if it is more powerful, it is impossible to drag such a huge and bulky guy to jump far. The anti-magic technique that was added to the body did not produce the slightest effect. It was not the magical power and the twenty real objects that held him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reluctantly with this total and a thousand elements of the earth jumped out of the rock, watching the gas elements and the Knights of the Temple are already in sight, the Tauren’s Great Sacrifice Unwilling to bark, dragged by the earth elements and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talis Knight, it’s beautiful." Sylvia praised it. These magic scrolls are powerful, but the timing and method of use are the most critical. Otherwise, at least one more between the two was shot down by the Tauren. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Syrian, you use the scroll now." Talis responded with a faint sensation, manipulating the element of gas and flying upwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A muffled sound, sand and stone splash. After the Tamar Grand Sacrifice, I finally got rid of this earth element in midair, and then used a quicksand technique when landing, and turned my own piece into a quicksand. Otherwise, this height is absolutely impossible to escape in terms of the weight of the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dizzy struggles to look up, the Tema Grand Sacrifice just sees a pure and dazzling eye, more than snow than any white The white flames rolled over and over, and even the brown head of the tower seemed to be whiter in this dazzling white light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" The Tamar Grand Sacrifice screamed like a struggle. Then the sound was drowned in the white sea of ​​fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pure white flame is like a rolling river that falls from the sky and falls down. When it falls to the ground, it spreads, flows away, and drowns everything that passes through it. , Tauren, eagle banshee, evil eye, black elf, Medusa... Whatever it is, whether it is a living or a corpse, is it rushing away or squatting on the ground, one is involved in this The waves of the flames of the Tianhe River hang down and were immediately submerged in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The escaping of the rush, the painful struggle of dying, everything is calm in this white wave. This vast magical wave is grand and does not appear to be turbulent and compelling. It does not seem to be death, it is peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before it was full of killings, corpses, flames and screams, now it’s all a milky white light, the ruins of Othello bathe in this large white flame In the middle, the holy radiance of white magic is soft and dazzling, calm and gentle, like a paradise in the minds of honest believers. But the others have not been submerged by the white flames, only watching all the tauren who are spreading like the raging flames, the black elves and other underground residents all mad like the throat, all the creatures before the death Scream and sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purgatory paradise cannot completely cover the scope of this circle, and the Tauren black elves have also begun to flee in the passage caves, white flames in Syr Under the control of Via, he poured into several of the largest ramps. The white magical lively submerged the crowded tauren and the black elves, and the screams and screams subsided and returned to a heavenly peace and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Purgatory Paradise is one of the most troublesome ways of releasing in the curse, but this huge coverage and controllable way is completely devastating. The curse is too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cursed scroll in the hand finally played its magical power and turned into a fly ash. Sylvia is already exhausted, but looking at the bottom of the white sea that is still shining, the tower is also satisfied. One of the most lethal curses played around all his magical powers. At least tens of thousands of Taurens, black elves, and Medusa are dying in this bright flame. If they count on each other, the Nigan army is already a devastating blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of curse magic can only fully play such amazing effects in such a dense and closed environment. If it is in the plains, this curse can only kill thousands of Oufu orcs, and it is also possible to exclude the possibility of being interrupted by a master such as Gru or Sedrot during the release process. But now the result is the release of all the Western Defense Forces in several countries, including Elazia, which are tens of thousands of well-equipped troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
