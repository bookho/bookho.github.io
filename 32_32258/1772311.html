			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis was talking, and she also saw that Asa seemed to have something wrong, but the atmosphere that gradually began to pervade made her dare not come forward. She only screamed anxiously. Ai Mei has already passed out in her arms at this time. "I don't want to die! Go on the road. Yes, go on the road! The black smell of Asa's eyes is suddenly scattered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road is to go and go fight Going to face everything, accepting everything, don't want to die. Don't want to die! This voice is not big in Asa's mind, which has gradually blurred consciousness. But just like the atmosphere in the house, it is also in the consciousness of Asa. A mouthful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desires of those who were originally suppressed and almost disappeared were spurred and immediately rushed out. Asa’s hand was loose, from the hilt The breath that was constantly coming was suddenly interrupted. All the death sorrows that had been swaying in my mind were dissipated. Before the blade was landed, Asa used the pocket filled with the sun well water to live the sword. The handle is gently slammed, and the dark and strong atmosphere completely disappears from this space.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's go on the road. Asa took a long sigh of relief. Turned her head and smiled at Talis. He had sweat on his forehead, and he was very tired and very calm. Although it was already dangerous, now he looks like Nothing happened like this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought you were wrong. Talis also took a long sigh of relief and took Ai Meimei over. Ai Mei just fainted, and there was nothing wrong with it. At this time, the breath disappeared and she woke up leisurely. Rubbing his eyes, looking at Talis and Asa holding her in confusion, she doesn’t seem to understand what happened just now. No matter what happened to Asa, Shant did not have any action, just quietly Watching, as Kossa's silence, wake up, his eyes are constantly changing. But there is no movement or opening. But until the three people walked to the passage, he suddenly said: "Wait. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened? "Asa turned back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You go this way because you should go, you are qualified to go." I have not done anything, but I have fulfilled my responsibility to keep the road here. But if you help me cure the injury, it is superfluous. Shante shook his head and seemed to be very dissatisfied. "I said that I would not be in love with you." If I feel that I owe someone else's feelings, I can't sleep. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are right, it is purposeful to help you cure the wound. It is the city that sells well and is malicious." "Asa smiled and said. "But in fact, you did cure me. Even if it is malicious, my cough that has been coughing for 30 years suddenly does not cough, and I will always think about what I owe you. In order for me to forget this, I will send you two things. "The two figures covered with cloth on the corner of the wall came over. I ripped off the cloth that had been covered on my body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also the time I spent thirty The things that Kung Fu pondered out. Because of the lack of experimental materials, only two have been made until recently. Although it’s not quite done, it’s still usable. You use it, so you and me will be even. Shante said faintly. From the beginning, Asa and Talis knew that these two should be zombies or cockroaches, but when the huge cloth was ripped off, the two "people" were exposed. At the time of the real face, both of them were stunned and completely stunned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been half a day since the passage of the mountain hut. It was very narrow at the beginning. But after more than an hour, it opened up and officially entered the real underground world of Nigan. Except for occasional passages, it is reminiscent of this being underground. There is basically no cave. The taste of the place is boring.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some particularly wide spaces, even some people can have the feeling of a wilderness, often on the top of a hundred meters high. Numerous gemstones are shimmering like stars, and the surrounding area is wide and wide. If it is in the center of Nigan, it is said that there are large underground plains that are dozens of miles wide.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the average person imagined here is nothing In the dead zone of the machine, a variety of plants and animals are found in a wide variety of places, especially around the underground river. In many places, there are some illuminating plants or gems on the rock wall, although it is very faint, After getting used to it, you can barely see things.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you use the standard of the surface, this should be just a wilderness path. It seems that it has not been The dark elves, the Taurens, and other underground people have been involved. There is a map of Ai’s mother who does not know how long ago the map indicates the way forward.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
