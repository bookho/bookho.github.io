			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luya with the road ahead is silent. The silver of the waterfall, like silk, sprinkled on her back with a pair of pointed ears that were exposed in the foreign silver and swayed slightly with the pace. Although the shape of the slender man is beautiful, it does not bring the atmosphere of fireworks like the scenery of the same pair and the surrounding world. Especially when she deliberately does not leave her words, she can only subconsciously stay in the sights and can't go any further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa quietly watched her back behind her. In fact, Lu Ya’s eager attitude toward him at the end of the battle yesterday made him quite a bit stunned. From the whispering of the forest to the Karendo, the way to avoid the death of the wizard, the two can be said to be dependent on each other. For her, that is probably the most memorable experience of her life. But when Gru and his round of conversation came down, her eyes were incredibly disappointing and angry eyes Asa remembered very clearly. Since then she has stopped talking to Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked silently forward. Along the way, many elves were very respectful to Luya and looked at Asa with a little strange look. Although they knew that he was a friend of Cedros or a benefactor of the elves who had escorted the sacred objects, many things in this person did make them unacceptable. If it weren't for the two elders and Cedros, he would personally confirm that he was only using the weapon he had used that he had used. The elves will assume that he is either a spy of the Necromancer or a spy of Nigan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Luya's leadership, the two came to a huge war under the ancient tree in the middle of the forest in the province of Tula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of people who have been surrounded by this method has been unable to calculate the size of the tree. Because the person who saw the tree at first sight would never think that this tree would only think that he saw a huge castle or a hill that stretched out numerous branches and no one would want to hug a mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old tree is very thick. But it is not too high. At least not enough to see it outside the forests of the Sierra Leone, which has been stretched for hundreds of miles, and after entering the forest, the sights are usually blocked by nearby trees and generally do not see this miraculous plant. But when people stand under the tree, they look up and see the sun in the sun, except for the occasional sun and the leaves. This will make you look like an ant beside an elephant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ladder consisting of countless side branches extends from the roots of the old tree to the top of the tree. Luya leads Asa toward the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they haven’t reached the top of the tree, they are already quite high on the stairs from the ground. Luya, who was walking in front, suddenly asked: "Why are you keeping the black elf?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stunned and scratched his head. Sighed and said: "Because it seems that only I can maintain her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luya did not talk and did not return to continue to walk up. After a while, the two came to a tree house at the top of the tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting of the elder elders in the tree house just ended the elder elders who nodded to Asa and looked at him with some strange eyes. Luya and other elders left the tree house and left only Elder Lloyd and Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please sit down." Elder Lloyd pointed to a position in front of the window. In fact, this is not so much a tree house as a tree hole on an ancient branch. He looked at the window and looked at the back of Luca, who was leaving, saying to Asa: "It seems that Elder Luca is still angry with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Asa shrugged and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Lloyd looked at him with interest. Said: "But yesterday you did a bit surprising. I always thought that you and Mr. Sedros must have a good understanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa said with a smile: "I didn't respond at the time. And I really don't have much to play with these machines."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you later understand how to make that choice? Elder Lloyd looked at him and continued to ask his face a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about Asa is still a bitter smile: "I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red The bishop and the group of people only took away the limbs and disabled. They couldn’t say that the other thieves like the same pile of meat hills were thrown here and left to the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Being busy with other things..." Asapo looked at the Elf girl a little embarrassed. In front of the elves, the commanding elders were in front of him like a little child who saw the big brother who had not seen for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Lloyd looked at the thieves who were tied up. These murderous and murderous murderers still have a lot of sorrows in the desperate situation. After all, like Hilika Those who are not so violent are like human beings. Elder elders sighed and waved to the elves: "They all surrendered. And I swore in the name of Mafa to let them leave here safely. Put them Let them all go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thieves look at the elder elders as if they are watching the greatest miracle of the Savior descending from the sky. The mouth of the old man of the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elves are very reluctant to let these people go, but the vows of their elders in the name of Mafa are not to be violated. In desperation, they only let the thieves let go and let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the thieves’ backs, Elder Lloyd suddenly sighed at Sedros and said, “These people will inevitably not talk about the things of today when they go out. The inner condition of Leon Forest will leak out. In fact, I really don't want to let them go, but the vows can't be violated... It's really trouble..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sed Lost’s heart will smile. Say: "You can rest assured that these people are all multi-disciplinary. Many people will be self-satisfied. I think that when they leave the forest, they will get sick and still have a big illness. There is no chance to talk to people about life today. The story here." He paused and smiled and said: "In fact, the group of people in the church also decided that they would have this strange disease, so they didn’t care if they said everything today. Lester is not without influence. A cardinal and paladin led the four Knights of the Templar, the ten templars, to the mighty and finally sneak away. This is the church coalition that is about to start fighting. The morale is not a small blow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This thing only has to bother you and your new owners." Cedros Looked at Asa's very concealed gesture of pulling a thumb on his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed and nodded and said. Luya’s eyes swam between him and the two old men. It seems to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves who heard the words of the elders and Cedros do not understand what metaphors mean in these words. Although these elves are over 100 years old, age and sleekness are usually not the same thing. They live in a simple environment for a long time, especially with simple beliefs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss...the relationship between you and you is..." Hilton came over. Carefully pointing to Cedrus and Gru to ask Asa. Although he can see some clues, he still can't be sure. What the two men showed was almost terrifying combat power. In his eyes, it seems that it can no longer be attributed to the category of ‘people’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s my employer..." Asa briefly said that it’s not the time to talk about them in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait for you." Gru suddenly made a gesture to Jessica. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica immediately walked over. In front of Gru, she completely lost the usual unruly wildness as if she suddenly became a kitten from a female leopard or a kitten that had been cut off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru’s eyes swept over her and said coldly, “You are going to die”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Almost everyone is jealous. This sentence itself is not very strange, usually the declaration of the roar before the last blow in the fight. But if you are an imperative language, it is very weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the voice of Gru. The whole body of the female black elf began to tremble immediately. All the dark scorpions were filled with despair and fear, and even a little bit of rebellion did not arise like a rabbit in front of a beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hurry up, do you want me to do it?" Gru frowned. Watching the black elf impatiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica is still trembled and exquisitely beautiful and also twisted under the twist of muscles but she did not die like Gru. Her face was immersed in sweat and a glimmer of fire ignited from the black eyes. Her slender fingers grabbed the two short swords at her waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
