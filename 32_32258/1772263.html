			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small country's alliance south of Ernfast. Over the years, these countries that believe in the gods of the elements have been arguing with the empire until recent years. Only after a series of treaties were signed, a lot of friction was gradually reduced to calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of these small countries is not strong, even if they are together, there are not as many as half of Einfast, but they have been able to fight the empire for many years. Army. One of the biggest reasons is to stand on the border of Ian Fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not necessary to say that other small wizards’ guilds, even Celeste and the School of Magic, are not worthy of the achievements and powers of elemental magic. . It is the largest recognized magician organization and the largest and best elemental magician's college. The magicians who come out of here every year account for more than half of the big six. The alliance of several small countries was also unbeaten in front of the Imperial Army by the strong support of the magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not really just a tower. In fact, it is the general name for the four magic towers of the ‘soil’ ‘fire’ ‘water’ ‘qi’. The four towers of the same shape are towering in a slight arc at the top and can be easily seen just a few dozens of fangs that stand out on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one that is all white is the room on the top of the tower of the Air Tower. Master Aiden’s low-profile reputation is not loud on the Big 6 or even unknown in many places, but the incomparable air magic practice is highly admired by the students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air magic on him is not even like magic, but he can withdraw some of the used limbs at any time plus the owner’s whereabouts. The expression of long-term indifference is like a frozen voice, and the wind is blowing like a high altitude. Some people even jokingly suspected that he was simply a human figure with a group of air elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main room of the tower is now closed because Master Aiden is meeting a guest. This is absolutely rare for the tower owner who seems to have no communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elves really used the door of the different dimension to come to the whisper of the slang? The ancient tree of war will invalidate the enchantment of the sun well for two days? Fake? Two days to the whispering of the singer... It is only the use of flying or summoning elements to carry people. Although it takes only half a day from the air, but not many people. But these are not the focus... Master Aiden looked at the Marquis coldly. "The point is why should I help you for these unreliable words? I am very polite to receive you as a member of Deya Valley. Don't forget that I have already seen it in the same place. The member is very polite. Don't forget that I don't like you very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't need to believe me. You don't need to like it. Just trusting the great Lord Akibad is enough.” The Marquis took a book from his arms and threw it to Aiden. "And I know that you must like this too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aiden’s master just took over the pair of ice-like expressions and suddenly collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very old leather book. Although it is very old, it is not damaged in the slightest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The open page is full of dense and fluent ancient words, and the neat and crisp font shows that this is from a well-trained person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is...Akibad's notes...and the real meditation on it..." Aiden looked at the Marquis and even lost his voice. "You stole from Sandro? No wonder... He wants your life so much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You yourself. Above about the Elf War Although the ancient book records are not detailed, you can see that I should not lie to you. How? If you are willing to help me, this will be given to you." The Marquis said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, it is useless to take this thing now. The real meditation is not attractive to me now." Aiden thought for a sigh. The expression echoed the chilly wave. "And. The reason I don't want to help you is that I hate you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you add the Ghost of the Ghost?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The expression of Aiden’s master is not just a crash but also a direct transition from freezing to boiling. "You even stole that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
