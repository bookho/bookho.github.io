			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The well water that allowed the war trees to absorb the sun wells has been temporarily suspended, and the enchantment is slowly recovering. However, it seems that this kind of caution is already unnecessary. For the time being, there is no threat. The elves were amazed when the magical array was lit. However, it is only the tower of the tooth that can get the whispering of the whispering reel, and the person who comes naturally is also the tower of the tooth tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai Mei did not think that he could get the news of his brother when he came, but he didn’t even think that the news was that his brother was dead. She just fainted after seeing the cold body of Abin. After waking up, I burst into tears and fainted several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of elves who have seen Abin and Talis in the same way as the Grey Knight who loves to kill the elves, and Talis is As early as in Tula Lyon, it has been followed by Lancelot, and the identity of the Knights of the Temple is well known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Luya’s ice is still conscious, seeing all the sights, plus Asa’s commentary, the elves have not embraced the female knight. Unloading eight pieces, let her stay in the low mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s all my fault." Talis looked at Ai Mei, who was holding Abin’s body and was crying to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the daytime, the face of the horsewoman’s face can be seen in the release of vitality and emotions, or happy or angry or depressed. Any subtle mood change can be detected from her face. But now it seems that these feelings are suddenly too much and too heavy, and the opposite side is invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of person is the Tamik Knight? I am actually very clear. But I can’t help but stop him, this is the latter. Everything... In fact, I should guess that it is really my meaning, if I can stand it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No. If you can't stand it at the time," Asa said lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tallis eyes stunned and silent. There is only a cry of Ai Meimei who has been crying hoarsely in the tree house. Asa and Talis have withdrawn from the tree house. It seems that it is correct to let people vent their anger at this time. The key is that they really don't know how to persuade them. After a long while, Talis said again: "Abin has no reason to die here. Everything here is not his business..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "But he is dead." Asa whispered her words. "There has never been a way to recover. There is no reason to evade it, is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weird and angry eyes flow in the eyes of Talis, However, she could not find the direction of Xuanhui to erupt this feeling of sadness and anger. She instinctively wanted to get angry with Asa, but it seemed that he was right. Finally, she finally sighed long and nodded angrily: "Yes, you are right, this is my fault."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can make mistakes . But only those who admit mistakes will not make the same mistakes. Talents who dare to face mistakes are qualified to grow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa silently sighed after a while and said: "Sorry, I do have some anger for you. Abin is dead, not just you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis’s eyes calmed down, not the silence that dissipated the emotions, but the silence that calmed everything down. . After a long while, she sighed again and said: "He was met before to kill me, but finally saved me... I finally understand the meaning of what the teacher told me, maybe there is really nothing. The high and high righteous evil allows us to identify the reality, and everything needs to be chosen and controlled by ourselves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked at the female knight sideways, he can tell It is indeed a lot of growth. Although there are some accidental reasons, it can kill people like the Knights of Tamik. It is really evidence that her mind has matured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa said: "You don't care for Ayi Mei? Abin is already her only relative."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know. He entrusted me before he died. Just how do I take care of her? I am a man who has nowhere to go..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you still want to follow me? I tell you, the road behind may be more difficult to walk than this. This time you are almost dead, the next time you can still be a little bit worse, there are people like Abin. Save me, I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has already started, I don't want to stop. And now I just understand a little, there are still many Things don't understand, so I will follow you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis's voice and expression are no longer felt out of the previous ones, but everyone feels firm, but Asa can feel the kind of determination under calm. He also knows. She probably really decided that she would be the road sign on her way to truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Plop" came from the tree house, and Ayimei cried again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another day, the well water of the Sun Well has finally recovered, and the war tree has grown. Ai Yimei finally recovered from extreme pain. Asa is ready to go on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war tree grows according to the sun well. The old trees are tall and stout, like a mountain, which is bigger than in Tula, and the branches and leaves are almost everywhere. Covered a small half of the whispering forest. Standing under the tree, I felt nothing but feeling small. Even Talis was shocked by the magical miracle left by the ancient elves. It's just that the size of the tree itself is almost the same size as the shining castle that the church is proud of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pure and natural magical fluctuations pervade the entire forest, all the functions of the war ancient trees can be used normally, Asa has seen many of the above leaves have similar The rifle-like launcher, and he must have launched something that is simply not as simple as a rifle. The banned rope world also plays a role at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending a new scroll of magical spells to Oufu, General Gru and elite orcs can come in time if necessary. At this time, it is not necessary to say that it is the magician of the Tower of the Tooth or a few Knights of the Temple. Even if Celeste has all the power to mobilize the army, it will definitely not come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now I can rest assured that this last world tree leaf is complete. You should be careful if you should be careful later. Elder Lloyd is probably coming from the king." They are all back." The small pocket is filled with well water from the sun well, and another small pocket is reserved. Asa and Talis and Ayi Mei and the edge of the whispering of the whisper, they are on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai Yimei still looks awkward. Abin's ashes are going to be taken back to Erasisia for burial, and I will leave with Asa. "How long have you been going this time?" Luya asked. She glanced at Talis and Ayimei next to Asa, and her expression was not natural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe soon, maybe I don't know how long it will take." Asa smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luya stunned for a moment, suddenly wrinkled his nose and squinted, a little hesitant and said a little hurriedly: "In fact, I really want to go out for a trip. Growth sees you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled and said: "Don't be childish, you are a whispered elder, the world tree leaves still You need to protect it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luya also had some awkward smiles, slightly disappointed with the child, nodded and said, "Yeah... I am just joking Let me talk about it... I showed you..... If you have completed this journey, you are welcome to come to the whispering forest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just not welcome the church guys, the next time they see them they can't help but want to pull the bow and shoot them at the arrow." The female patrol with a black big bow next to her eyes stared at Talis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night, the strongest warrior of the elves was stunned by Talis in his sleep. Although they are hurt and tired, they slept very hard. The knight’s stealth skills are absolutely at home, and the magical eyes of the Templar are directed. This is not surprising, but it is also a great blow to her self-esteem. . In the past two days, if she was not the persuasion of Elder Luya, she asked for a duel with the Horsewoman several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis only looked slightly and frowned and looked at the female elf. If it was before, she would never let go of this obvious provocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the whispering enchantment of Assault, Asa took out a magic scroll from the Tower of the Tooth. A small whirlwind jumped out of the reel and landed on the grass. The surrounding air quickly gathered, and in a moment the whirlwind became a tall, cloud-like giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
