Even as one of the 6 strongest magicians, he has not heard of this name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis said: "The following is a very coincidental opportunity to view the notes left by the Necropolis of Necromancer. In his notes This legendary magic mentioned a little may not even have been seen by Akibad himself. It is only a description of the transmission magic used by the elves of the ancient times to transfer the army. His Majesty said that even the ancient trees of war disappeared. I guess that's probably the case. And from this pile of powder, this magic probably consumes a whole star's eye at a time. They may have sacrificed their own magical array to use this magic."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...not just sacrificed the magical array to use this magic." The Pope thought about shaking his head. "Transmission of magic is a biphasic effect. Since it is called a door, there is a huge amount of space fluctuations reported by the Knights of Tamik for a short period of time. It should be a means of transmission such as a channel. To maintain the balance of space must be There is another eye of the same star in the delivery destination, so the eye of the star that this magic consumes must be two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a subtle insight into the subtle." Marquis nod. This sentence is indeed a heartfelt admiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adela surprised and asked: "Two? Even Celeste now has only one complete star eye. And the eyes of the entire Big Star 6 Almost all have been used to transmit the core of the magic array. Where do they go to find such precious gems..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oufu. That must be from Europe Blessing." Marquis talked. "Oufu is so close to the Sandefes and the orcs are also best suited to be active in the harsh environment of the Sandefes and the power of the half-elf called Gru. I believe they are now at the eye of the star. Some of the top magical gems may be more than Descartes and Celeste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adela nodded: "But that is two The Eye of the Star. The old man of Celeste is definitely getting enough benefits from the elves to give them just don't know what it is. Unfortunately, we can't put a traitor in the upper class. This is the biggest inconvenience."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It must be food." The Marquis almost immediately answered without thinking. "The most lacking of the food is the food supply and the magical life of the elves is enough to make the crops grow on the wild land. Although the elves have always tried not to get involved in this world struggle, but for the sake of migration, they have to compromise with Oufu. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that it is impossible for us to slowly delay the strategy of Oufudi. We must even attack again as soon as possible." The Pope slowly nodded his face. Slowly getting heavier and heavier. "And <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really don't want Oufu's condition to be just this one... In case the elf also taught the use of this different dimension to Oufu. Although it takes two eyes to use once... But I think that using Sedros's mind once is enough to reverse the whole situation. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can Transferring tens of thousands of elves and even a huge and unimaginable war tree can naturally send thousands of elite orc warriors to any place you want to go. A place that can definitely change the situation on both sides ups and downs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adela was so shocked that he could not speak. But what shocked him was not only that this inference was a process inferred by the Pope and the Marquis. It is only from the migration of the elves that this long-term and clear conclusion can be drawn. And before that. The judgments and agreements of the positions between the two are concealed and concise, but they are distinct and decisive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vision of the Adelaide bishop turned around again. I breathed a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope looked at the Marquis and asked again: "Is it true that the slang of the Elves of the Holy Land was razed to the ground by a mysterious fire a year ago?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All of you have a clear understanding of the autumn." Marquis gave a slight smile and nodded. "But there is a sun-filled divine power that believes that the whispering of the singer is probably restored to its original state. The elves are the only destination if they want to migrate here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Bishop Adela said in the previous step: "Since this is so important, we must also get the ancient elf inheritance from the elf, and at least we must use the method of the different dimension to make up for us." The gap between Oufu and Oufu. The entire Elves are only tens of thousands. But only the priests of Celeste have 20,000 people, not to mention the army that can be mobilized. We can use strong..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
