			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance of twenty miles is not too far. Even at this time, the black-pressed undead army can be seen on the desert horizon. The darkness of the square is nearly a hundred miles, and everything is covered up. It is like an independent dead space. It is faintly visible to see this dead white color. It is countless skeleton zombie ghosts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closer you are, the more you can feel the power of this dead and dead. At first glance, there are countless skeletons and zombies in addition to the endless black. Tens of thousands of human forces are like a small dead leaf in front of this sea of ​​death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally this dead leaf hit the endless sea of ​​death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea was broken. It seems that the incomparably tens of thousands of people are not dead leaves but a sword that burns hot red. It was not swallowed up but began to break out of the sea in this sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sword provokes a huge wave of undead monster wreckage sweeping through the undead sea and flying through the skeleton carrion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outermost undead is all zombies except for some old and broken skeletons. Although the dark appearance is like drying up the centuries-old corpse, the clothes still on it are feared that this is a person who can't escape from the city where the undead army is destroyed. No body can be left under the breath of the King of the Dead. And now these low-level undead are smashed into pieces under the iron hoof of the cavalry in front of the coalition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prayers of the pastor's mourning are intertwined with a loud singer and a squeaky hoof. This majestic voice and the coalition forces rushed in this sea of ​​death and turned into the undead that they encountered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only remaining bishops of the Glorious Castle are all fighting in the ranks and almost all the clergy of the pastor's priests. In this dark and boundless death, the power of white magic is actually suppressed to a minimum. But they must be in the ranks not only the morale of the warriors but also their white magic to resist the breath of all souls in the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wrath wrapped in the light of the Holy Light has been killed in the center of the Dead Sea like a sharp sword Black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not play. At the end of the army, he only flew forward with the army and looked at the distant bones and carrion waves under the charge. <br /><br />###################################################################################################### They were surrounded by the ranks of the Paladins and the sergeants, and then a little ahead of the Orpheus Orchestra did not fight. This is the most elite force left in the final force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless skeletons and corpses in the rear of the troops that are re-gathering. No matter the impact of the coalition forces, the powerful and undead souls are just quietly refilling the gaps that are opened like a stream of water. The silence of death is also the dignity of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the ultimate victory or defeat, the outermost warriors will never be able to escape. Asa's head had a slight sweat, but his hand on the handle was stable, as familiar as the dry touch, and it was soft and soft like the fit between the bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s so continually killing. Surrounded by shouting weapons, the sound of the broken bones on the bones is broken. In the concerted concerto with the hymn, the fragments of the dead are falling like snow. Time seems to be still in this strange killing, only the constant rushing and killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that after a hundred years, there was a sudden bloody smell in the air. At the same time, the advance of the army seems to be slightly stagnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shouting around the horseshoe slash is still as unstoppable as the smashing in the light of the past, but Asa does have a feeling of being slightly obstructed like a The fish swimming in the water suddenly slammed into a mass of oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Beginning." This is not his illusion. Lancelot and Roland also felt it at the same time. "A little earlier than I expected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we in that position? Twenty-three or twenty-four? Roland asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
