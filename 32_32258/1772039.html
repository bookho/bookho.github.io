			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa followed the captain Sanders out of the camp. Although Sanders is a steel armor, he is actually faster than a light-weight one. Other soldiers who were awakened by the whistle also hurriedly picked up their weapons and ran over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is clear under the bright moonlight. A few tall and low figures on the intersection outside the camp stood quietly in the soft moonlight and could not alleviate the ominous atmosphere of the weapons in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tallest one is an ogre. Even in the same family, the body is very large and twice as tall as the average person. Wrapped from head to toe in the specially built armor, the hands and feet are each carrying a large and a small pair of spike hammers that match his body. The moonlight reflected on his armor and weapons into a sharp cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two werewolves next to them. In order not to hinder their high agility and degree, wearing only a set of meteor hammers in the hands of the hard leather armor, although not as horrible as the weapons in the hands of the ogre, is still enough to crush any armor. There are also three lizards whose armor and the werewolf hold the big knife with one person. The two half-orcs on the far side are each carrying an extra-large machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this group of murderous orcs, there is a very thin and small figure, neither armor nor weapons, just a cloak to put the race And hide it from the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sanders’ face is whiter than white paper in the moonlight. He did not expect that the situation would be so bad. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than a month ago, he received an order from the head of the Paladin to let him secretly lead a team of soldiers to the west side of the wasteland to detect the unusual behavior of the orc tribe. For more than a decade, Western troops have been raving about the orcs of all races. Almost all the orc tribes on the western wasteland have been slain. Therefore, although he was specifically told to act with caution, he only thought that he would encounter some sporadic attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs do not understand smelting and forging. Whether it is production tools or weapons, most of them are simple stone tools. Therefore, even physical strength and combat effectiveness are far more vulnerable than the human superiors in the face of well-equipped troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These orcs races never go to each other. These primitive and ignorant sub-humans even refused to contact any other civilizations simply by sticking to the unique lifestyles and beliefs that have been passed down from generation to generation. A tribe and a tribe quietly waited for the irons of the human army to be flattened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now these common senses have been crushed by the facts at hand and will be a smash with a strong bloody taste. This well-armed orc mixed force in front of us will never just let them see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a barren hill surrounded by cliffs. Sanders chose to station here because the view is very good and easy to defend. Even if the orcs want to attack at night, they can defend themselves well. There is only a single intersection to keep it, so that no orcs can get it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, as long as you stand at this intersection, no one can escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure in the middle of the orc who was wearing a cloak suddenly moved and seemed to nod and gently sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very standard human voice that is very relaxed and casual, like a note that agrees when you are drinking tea and listening to a friend in the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre next to it is like a soft voice that starts a valve in the body and looks like a beast that is licking the head and neck. The bondage was suddenly released by a gentle touch, and an horrible roar rushed toward the crowd. The huge body and the heavy armor of each body are making the ground slightly tremble, and all the soldiers in front of it will be smashed. All the soldiers will show a terrified look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa just thought about how to escape when I saw the orcs. He is very clear that the situation of these orcs, since they can calmly and quietly touch the mountain to hold the intersection, is absolutely sure to kill them. And he knows more about what it means to be a heavy weapon with a heavy weapon. Generally speaking, just an ordinary ogre is enough for twenty armed soldiers to deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cliff is very high, even if the height of the Dono River below is enough to make a patties on the rocks at the bottom of the water. But Asa knew that there was a tree in the middle of the cliff behind him. He tried to pour the branches with urine when he urinated. The position of the tree on the cliff and the thickness of the branches are clear enough to slow down the drop to a safe level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military has already disappointed him to use his own power to deal with the ogre to revitalize morale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of the figure seems to be the loud noise of the mountain itself and the shocking ogre that can beat the ten cows Hit the ground. The contact between Sanders and the ogre was so fast that the soldiers could not see what was born. After a sound of metal impact, the ogre banged down and Sanders slid high and volleyed. A beautiful backflip stabilized. When the locals fell back, they waved in the sword of the sword in front of the sword. Slowly a burst of blue and white fluorescent power is like a warrior jumping out of epic mythology. Hundreds of soldiers woke up from the horror and heard a scream of excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not ask that only he could see that the ogre was falling down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the two intertwined, Sanders avoided the hammering jump on the ogre's shoulder with a stunning agility to the middle of the helmet The gap is inserted. At the same time, the ogres waved up the hammer that fell on the other hand. Sanders' left-handed steel shield blocked the hammer and borrowed force to fly backwards, but the sword's tip has only been a little bit to stab the ogre eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘When 啷’ sounded, Sanders dropped the small steel shield of his left hand. The steel-made shield that is one inch thick has been completely deformed. Even the arc-shaped shield designed to resist heavy hammers and heavy weapons has no effect under that kind of power and that kind of weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the moonlight Asa seeing Sanders’s left hand with the shield, the fingers of the left hand have been completely deformed, it is impossible to see that it was still a finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sands put the sword into the ground and the right hand holds the twisted fingers one by one and pulls back to the original shape to restore the magical light. There was a cold sweat from the fingers, and the cold sweat in the forehead leached his expression without any fluctuations. The eyes of the torch had been staring coldly at the ogre who had climbed up in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Sanders’s calm look like a sculpture, a hot fighting spirit spread from somewhere in the body, Asa clenched his hand. Knife. He suddenly didn't want to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sanders removes the steel armor. Armor has no meaning. Only agility and degree are the only way to win. The two-handed clenched sword that has been focused on the spirit of the sword only finds the opportunity to not have to pick the weak place of the armor. He also has the confidence to carry it through and shouted: "Give me blessing." Two pastors in the crowd began The singer's mantras were white with a white light that resonated with them and Sanders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two half-orcs suddenly jumped on the shoulders of the werewolf and pushed the crossbows of the two priests with clear targets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of a priest immediately blew his blood like an egg and splashed around his brain. The soldiers behind him did not scream and slammed into the blood of the chest and went straight out from the big hole in the fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another pastor has an experienced warrior who raises the wooden shield in his hand at the right time to block the result of the priest’s broken hand and the wooden shield The iron ball covered with spikes was embedded in the face of the priest. The soldier made a wailing and fell in the strange position with the priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sands suddenly rushed to the ogre. He knew that he had to kill this most lethal behemoth in at least two orcs. Before reinstalling the two frames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure under the cloak said a few words, except for the two orcs, all the orcs immediately rushed to the crowd. One of the werewolves greeted Sanders, who was heading for the ogre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance of a few tens of meters seems to be within reach of the lizard's amazing explosive power. Almost the soldiers just started to feel the actions of the orcs. Three lizards had already rushed to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foremost soldier was as fragile as a straw under the long knife of the lizard, and fell four or five with just one knife. The attacking posture of the lizard man is slashing on the abdomen. A long blade of a person has a blood and viscera coming out together. Then the following wolves attacked at least two soldiers flying up and being smashed by a huge meteor hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa alone took the attack of a lizard man. He rushed up against the blade and the long weapon range was too big to hide. The power of the lizard is only slightly better than that of human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long weight, the weight of the weapon will be obvious. Asa's first knife was placed on the side of the hard-working handle of the other side. The second knife smashed the danger of losing both sides and forced the lizard to return to the knife to wait until the fourth knife. The lizard had to drop the big knife and pull out the small axe at the waist and jump backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
