			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Thomas, who had just arrived in the palace of the palace, looked angry and watched the Cardinal and Rhodehart screaming in a roar: "The Queen is squatting." Isn't there a 100,000 big event that invites us to enter the palace? How are you two? How do you arrange the place here? Is it not in the Chamber? There are so many guards and paladins outside the palace. What are you doing with arrogance? Actually, I am not allowed to bring followers to fear that we will rebel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The generals please sit down. Although the situation is really urgent, but still wait for the prime minister to come over and say Let's go." The Cardinal answered very calmly. "Because the situation is very good, there are some very special guards and measures. Please don’t mind if you don’t mind too much about you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Thomas smashed Jawi The bishop gave a glance. He didn't have a good impression on the young bishop from this church and even suggested that the head of Roland be looking for a chance to get rid of it. The head of Roland and the prime minister naturally did not agree. Now this little head is inexplicably relying on healing the Queen’s illness. A small movement in the king’s days has stood firm and there is a real need to take over the magic school. . If you don’t remember that Colonel Roland’s own considerations, General Thomas has already started his own work. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of Jiawei seems to have turned a blind eye to the fire and murder in the eyes of the generals, and then turned his eyes to the distance outside the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bed of the Great Hall for the Emperor and the Queen’s rest has been blocked by heavy screens. Other vacant places are still very large, the Marquis of Minsk, the Minister of the Senate, and so on. The ministers of the DPRK and the Central Committee have already come to sit at the temporary meeting table. Everyone is confusingly whispering to talk about this sudden emergency call. These veteran ministers are actually not very concerned about the two young people, Cardinal and Rhodehart. But this time the summons is not just that the two of them and the Queen’s mouth have to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The prime minister is coming." A samurai swordsman walked into the report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt and Bishop Javey look at each other with the same look. This is the person they have been waiting for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime minister of the official uniform walked in under the leadership of the swordsman. at the same time. Both the Cardinal and Rhode Hart's eyes met her. Almost at the same time, the hearts of both of them moved. They all know that something is happening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime minister’s face is very calm and natural. It seems that there is no abnormal situation. But from their perspective, it is natural to see that this calm is not the shallow surface of the lake but the depth of the ocean surface is unpredictable, although it does not seem to be shocking. But below, there may be hidden endless waves and undercurrents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt’s heart is sinking. This shows that the prime minister knows what is inside and is innocent and that innocent nature still has that person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javier Bishop’s mood is much more complicated. He is confident in his father's strength and judgment. He believes that even in the face of Gru and Lancelot. The Marquis also has enough strength and the machine to go back. So he is not worried about the Marquis. Although it seems that the kid doesn't know what method to use to get rid of the Marquis, it really makes people feel awkward, but now the situation is almost in control. How can a single person play a trick? The Paladins are all in the palace. . Even the flies can't fly into one. So he is heartily about these problems but her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although just a rush of a pair of eyes, Bishop Javi can also feel that she has seen her own eyes more than a hundred times more than before. There is no doubt that she already knows who she is and knows what she is doing and what she has done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even so, her look can be so calm that she can hide so many emotions. This is the heart and the city, even if it is placed in the man. Outstanding. And she knows that this may be an emergency summoning against her and knows that her sister has fallen into the hands of others. However, it is also better to be alone in this courage and heart. So Jia Wei is very excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Always in his eyes ‘strong’ and ‘weak’ are the most important criteria. Those women who can't even control their short-sightedness, such as her queen's sister, can't control their own feelings. No matter how beautiful he is, he is not in the eye. And although she may not be the only woman who is most likely to be seen by him, the woman who is most qualified to enter his life path. And he still regrets her that she is a sign that he can represent himself completely before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a woman is now standing in such a strange hostile position with each other. Jawi’s mood is somewhat weird. But no matter how the mood is, the current situation is the most important. He smiled at the prime minister and bowed his hand: "I will wait for you to be a prime minister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime minister is slightly nodding and revealing no traces. I saw the cardinal in the face with a blank expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt immediately signaled that all swordsmen and guards were far away. Then he ordered the members of the Paladin to shrink to the outside of the hall for a hundred meters to ensure that they would not hear anything in it and that they would not be allowed to sneak into or approach. In this way, his heart was settled with some of the most elite swordsmen and senior magicians in the hundreds of empire of the Paladin. Even Gru and Cedros came to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, now that everyone has come, you can ask the Queen to kneel down." Thomas said that he looked at the space that was blocked by the screen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal took his eyes off the prime minister and glanced at the ministers who were here and said slowly: "In fact, today, letting you come here does not have the Queen’s It’s just what I meant after deliberation with Lord Rhodes...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What?” General Thomas’s eyes were on the table but he was glaring at Lot. Hart. "What do you kidnapped with this guy? When Roland’s head went, did you tell me this? Don’t think that you can now mobilize the Knights, you can believe it, I will call you right away..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal suddenly interrupted the general voice: "Please calm down some General Thomas. No one has ever said to you: Impulse is your own biggest Are you enemies? And you know that mistakes made by impulsiveness are sometimes irreparable..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence does not seem to be a good fit for the present persuade. However, General Thomas had heard that the whole body had been stunned and then slowly sat back in his chair. All the ministers at the table looked at him with very strange eyes. He couldn’t figure out how this grumpy general would be so inexplicable, but he himself looked at the Cardinal with a more strange look. Have some fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Jia Wei smiled inexplicably. I have lived in this kingdom for 20 years. I have been doing so long after the first politician and conspirators in the former Wangdu officialdom. He knows enough. Among them, the general violently killed a woman under the impulse of a certain drink. Finally, under the cover of the sophisticated politician, I was able to cross the sea. The sentence that Bishop Jiawei just said happened to be exactly what the kind-hearted politician said to the general at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most important thing that the good-hearted politician Jawi’s idol once taught him is that intelligence and means are really useful things on the official site. The idol used to be the character of the ministers who belonged to the king. habit. Good or even unknown mistakes are well understood. Although he himself has never used this forever, but these are very useful for the current Bishop Jiawei, which is one of the reasons why he dared to come to the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is quiet. The cardinal sighed softly and said: "In fact, this time in my name, it is a bit abrupt, but the situation is really serious. It has reached the point where you can't imagine it. So I and Rhode Hart have no choice but to do it. He paused to increase the tone of the voice. "You must remember the vampire's troubled royal hunting ground a year ago..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone nodded and there were several others Their faces have changed and they have experienced it personally. The bloody and brutal scene was enough to remember for a lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I have not witnessed it, I heard that this vampire was wiped out in the hands of the prime minister. Isn't it? That must be the prime minister. Is the memory still fresh?” Bishop Jia Wei asked the prime minister to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." The prime minister replied faintly that the eyes that were not big but fascinating were also faintly related to what he had in his eyes. He feels but can't say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of Jia Wei couldn’t help but smile and smile, and a woman who vowed to get it was confronted in this way. This is really a very weird thing. But on the surface his expression is incomparably heavy and muffled: "The prime minister must remember that the vampire was almost biting a bit on the neck of the queen. It must have been remembered by the ministers who were present at the time. Very clear..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
