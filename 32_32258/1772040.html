			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sanders saw the oncoming werewolf drop the weapon in his hand, he knew that it was no longer a battle and would become Unilateral killing. So he tried his best to make a loud command: "All the retreats can escape and try to escape and report the situation here." Then he was too busy to say it. The reason why the werewolf dropped the weapon was very simple. The original thing was just to deal with the armor and the shield. Now the opponent has given up the defense. No weapon is more flexible than his own paw and can entangle the opponent to make it poor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre avoided the interception of Sanders and rushed into the crowd and began a splendid feast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two huge wolf hammers do not have any clever changes or even fixed targets, only to be able to pick up as many human bodies as possible. Any armor is no different from paper toys, and it does not hinder the power of these two terrorist weapons. There was hardly a scream in the center of the splash of flesh and viscera. Once in contact with the waving wolf hammer, the living person immediately became a weapon. The armor skeletal muscles were mixed into a dead body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ogre frantically waved the weapon and marched toward the crowd. The trample rushed to the direction of another person. The same killing machine driven by the hell demon constantly smashed all the flesh and blood that could be touched. Smash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sanders’ order is irrelevant. When the ogre rushed into the crowd, the soldiers had only hysterical horror. The soldiers rushed to the mountain pass. Most of them were intercepted by the ogre in the middle and became a group of vaguely flesh-and-wolf and lizards who could escape with high agility. The two orcs who were at the intersection took out two smaller smashing arrows and pointed at the arrows that were occasionally close to the intersection. Some soldiers slammed from the cliff in extreme fear and pulled out a long scream and stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still screams on the top of the hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people face the fear of death and run away, they know that they will still turn into a pool of flesh-and-blood fear and despair will eat away all their strength and consciousness. The only thing left is a crying wailing. It is a kind of voice that people who have never heard of can never feel by feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wailing sound of the ocean skeletal fragmentation of the strange deformation of the body of the weapon torn the air and the tone of the meat intertwined with each other, a composer, but once heard of it, eternal life Unforgettable concerto. A similar kind of person who just said that he is still able to see the white bones suddenly turned out of the internal organs and still beats but has been pulled out of the body. Blood and meat are cheaper than garbage. Asa suddenly understood the exact meaning of the word 'hell'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of a half soldier flew over to the side of the Asa and Lizard who were ruined. Below the abdomen, the corpse was pulled into two internal organs and spread all the way to the lower body more than ten meters away. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa remembers that the soldier was squashed like a mud when he was in the process of conscription and the one that had been very powerful and had been entangled with himself. The iron shield in the hand is inlaid into the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mixture of sad fears swarmed and immediately covered up all his fighting spirit. The unscrupulous knife attack finally forced the lizard to jump out of Asa and seize this fleeting opportunity to turn and flew into the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saunders also took the same action with Asa at almost the same time. After a few swords, the scalp on the forehead was caught as the werewolf retreated. The position where he stood was closer to the intersection ahead. The ogre and the lizard were behind him, so he ran to the intersection where only two orcs and the cloak were occupied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a huge wind behind him. A spike hammer flew over his head and flew down the hill with a power that could turn him into a mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sanders looked back and glanced at the only surviving soldier who grabbed the head of the ogre and made the hammer he threw slightly higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Captain Run" soldiers screamed with the exhaustion of their strength. The face covered with blood is a bit stunned. It is the face of a face that has been distorted by countless scars. Half of the face was once shattered by a hammer weapon and then recessed. This is an experienced veteran who probably slammed the ogre's head when he fell to his knees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this shack, he also saw the werewolf picking up an axe on the ground and throwing it. The axe whirls in the air and pulls into a straight line to chase his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a roar of the ogre and then a half scream and a very strange voice. It seems that a lot of dead branches are put into a wet towel and the sound of the broken sound and the sound of the liquid seeping are mixed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sanders didn’t look back again. He used all his strength on the right leg and jumped forward and put the sword on his back. Negatively protect the spine condensing magic to prepare a healing spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A muffled sound. Saunders slipped out of the air for a few steps and squirted a blood and rushed to the intersection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The luck was very good. The axe was just thrown on the edge of the close-fitting shield. The three ribs broke and the lungs were hurt. Pre-prepared healing spells immediately stop bleeding and analgesia within a short period of time will not affect the action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance from the intersection is only about ten meters away. The fangs of the two orcs' mouths and the slightly panicked look on the face are clearly visible. The figure in the middle of the cloak still did not react at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you rush down the mountain to jump into the Dono River, there is a chance to escape. Sanders condensed all the remaining magical power into the hands of the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cliff is in front of the tree. Asa remembers that he was flying and jumping. Fortunately, he turned his body in the air and glanced at the lizard. He took a small scorpion from behind and shot at him. He swayed down and bent forward and felt the arrow licking his skin and then flew straight out of the cliff. The lizard, who followed, looked at the edge of the cliff and watched him break a branch in the air and insert another branch with a knife to completely relieve the fall and then safely enter the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I finally looked back at the hill, Asa saw a white light shining the whole hill like a white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword in the hands of Sanders is so beautiful. All the magic power has been injected into the blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood under the forehead has turned everything in the left eye into blood red. Sanders has no feeling that all his spiritual will is here. Out of a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two orcs were squinting in the strong light and flashing to the side, the figure in the middle of the cloak still did not move. Under the strong light of the sword, the face under the cloak can be seen clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a human face. Slightly thin and pale, the sculpture is as sharp as a sculpture. Under the long eyelashes, the black scorpion is like a bottomless deep pool that has stayed for a thousand years. It can't afford any fluctuations, only quietly reflecting the dazzling swordsmanship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still ten steps away from the person who still does not care to avoid the slightest change in the expression on the face. There is no movement around the whole body. It seems that a stone statue standing there from the beginning of the world will remain there until the next beginning of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are eight steps, seven steps, six steps, five steps, four steps, three steps, Sanders, and three hundred and sixty degrees before turning to the sword. The reaction force of the toe on the ground passes through the calf's thigh to the chest and then the shoulder to the wrist to reach the blade. Every muscle in the body spreads the power unreservedly to the sword's waving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a sword in the sword but a manipulator. Each of the most subtle movements is to pour out the sharpness of one's own sharpness and one of the magical forces that are in the perfect track. All orcs stopped their movements and were completely attracted by this sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the sword turns into a light curtain in the rotation with a powerful force that can open the entire night. There is no sound, but all the orcs feel that they will hear the crack of the mountain divided into two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All powers of magic The will of any spiritual existence in the spiritual life is all merged in this sword into an unprecedented spark that has never been seen before. Saunders has no fear of anger and even the escape of the ** is lost. Just like a singer who sings a singer, the singer of the whole sigh is just immersed in melting his soul. He is about to split the flesh and blood in front of him into a fictional imagination with the highest notes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glory is as great as the world can continue At the end of the scene, the light curtain that suddenly opened the sky suddenly disappeared and was reduced to a static sword by one hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
