			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s impression of the elf originally came from the dwarf population. The few days after he stayed, the strengths of the dwarves were not only mechanical and forged literature, but also very rumored. At least those stings and ridicules described the elves' personality as vividly. It’s true that it’s self-righteous and self-righteous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves are proud of their identity and long-standing culture. The sacred glory of tens of thousands of years of long history is so heavy that any one of them must be careful not to be offended. Everyday prayers and ceremonies that are routine are spent on them for a long time. Although Elder Clan said that he would try his best to find a way to draw the power of his body, even if there are very few remaining days every day, if someone has developed new ideas and ideas, they must first discuss. The meeting sees whether there is a teaching of whether or not to offend their glorious traditions. This kind of progress really has a tendency to keep him here for a lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn’t matter if Asa knows how to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, I was still worried that the elves would imprison themselves in some way. However, unexpectedly, he was still allowed to take part in his casual activities. He probably thought that a man who was in this great place and plan would be flattered and betrayed probably because of the fact that Asa did not dare to come. But the most important reason is that they took a restraint that is said to be the unique eternal culture of the elves, calling him to swear by the gods of his own faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves expressed great shock when Asa answered that he did not have any gods of faith. Many elves sighed and sighed that human beings have really fallen into chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few academically advanced elves stand out later because the complex human beings have begun to believe in the ideas that have been derived from their own lives, such as the justice of justice. Money technology efforts and the like. The elves sighed and agreed that Asa would swear by his own belief and use it as a belief in his heart. Elder Clan also solemnly said to him: "Swear by what you believe in and use it as the yardstick of life. Then you will abide by your promises because you are afraid of being abandoned by it. Violence is our nobleness. We are absolutely not going to use the races that are ridiculous. God teaches us that 'constraints are better than constraining the mind.' So we use such a civilized and effective method of restraint."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa originally wanted to use a promise to perfuse the past but saw the elves so serious that they felt embarrassed and frowned and tried to search for what they believed in their minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his hard-working expression, Elder Clan encouraged him to enlighten him and said, "Try hard to think about it. It is the thing you believe most in your life." The most important and most trusted truth is the belief in your life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa really tried hard and finally came to the conclusion: "I believe there is nothing to eat." If you are hungry, people will die." This is indeed his most convinced belief. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves listened to another commotion but argued fiercely after a while and agreed with him. After all, this is also a belief. So Asa used their rituals under the guidance of the elves to make a very weird oath: "I swear in the name of food that I will not escape from here." So all the elves agree that this human being has been bound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa doesn't like to lie. He is used to setting things up and sometimes even rampaging. However, he will never die and can't solve the problem of small and small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves have never given him the same vision, let alone trust. He can clearly feel that the elves see him as if humans are looking at the animals and he does not hide the fact that he is a lower grade creature. Of course, because they think they are elegant and do not show any hostile tone, the gentle face will never change. The indifference that never moves the fireworks is more able to express the contempt from the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not too angry for such contempt for Asa but makes his voice more powerful when he swears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These days he quietly lives in the elves' dwelling place as a simple container as they would expect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s completely different from the kind of dead silence that is felt outside the whispering forest. This forest is full of business. All kinds of strange insects and flowers and grasses, extraordinary unicorns, occasionally see some butterfly-like goblins flying in the flowers and plants. I can't see any artifacts here. The tree houses that the elves live in are purely the branches themselves. The various living utensils are also made with the insect carapace and the parts of the plants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A month ago, he was still in the waters of Wangdu and people were shouldering shoulders. When I came here, I first touched the zombies and then the huge tree people and then I was involved in the inexplicable ritual. The responsibility of the light and darkness seemed to be thrown from the real life into a mythical story. The horizon is wide open, but more is to return to your own life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the other elves' slabs, only the girl Luya still showed some signs of vitality. She seems to be very curious about the outside world and often comes to Asa to ask some strange questions about human life habits and society. Every time she listened to Asa’s words, she always opened her eyes and a horrified expression. For humans, they would actually kill the animals. Only the skins that draped them would kill each other, but they would do the horses to feed and support themselves. Unrelated others, etc. These are unbelievable. After she was surprised, she usually looked at Asa and shook her head and disgustedly said: "The barbarism is inferior." It seems that these things are all made by Asa himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she has been talking to Asa with some disdainful eyes and tone, but after all, the only emotional expression in this sluggish environment is milder than other elves but rigid The attitude is much more lovely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, Asa also directly asked him to inquire about the various conditions of the sun well and the leaves of the world tree, but she would immediately be alert: " You humans can't know this." Probably Elder Clan told her. But Asa just used some side-clicking methods to ask almost anything to ask. The relationship between the elves seems to be very simple. I never play these tricks. Even though she has lived nearly a hundred years old, she still has no temptation. Thanks to her, Asa did not need to go everywhere to inquire about the reconnaissance and reveal the traces of the knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the intelligence has been explored, the next step is to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather is very good There is no cloud in the sky. Today is the full moon. Even if the branches of the old trees are very dense, they should be brightly lit by the moon. It is a good opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stood on the tall tree house and watched the afterglow of the setting sun gradually disappear at the top of the forest. The moon slowly rose from the other side. The elves under the tree house have returned. This is the last time they go to the Sun Well three times a day and they will rest in their tree house. They don't go to cut down trees and don't know how to make other fuels. Sunset seems to them to mean that the end of the day is only the second day in their tree house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unicorns in the forest also walked to their nests. These very spiritual animals are not raised by the elves but are the same as the elves. Guards since ancient times. Like the elves, they never have the habit of evening activities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa walked into the tree house and sat down to start meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his first meditation since he entered the whispering forest. He must adjust his body and mental state to the peak state of the elves and unicorns will sleep, but the dead wood guards will not. From Luya's mouth, even if there were at least a few hundred big guys in the forest, except that they were killed by the red robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closed Eyes Asa quickly entered the state of the meditation that usually meditation. Everything outside the world can't feel the whole mind lost in his mind. All the spirits are concentrated in the inner senses of his body and become incomparably sharp. Every organ can feel the pulsation in coordination. The blood is forced out of the heart and penetrates into every tiny area with energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly there is an unprecedented feeling. An incomparably fiery but unburning force naturally arises from every drop of blood in every bone of every bone. With the blood in the body<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continuously circulates every part of the body with heat. The clarity of the original body was overwhelmed by the power of this chaos. All the body parts seemed to melt into one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes and could see that his body was already golden and dazzling as if the sun was in his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It feels slowly returning to calm and gradually disappearing. Asa opened his eyes and took a long breath. The body is full of unprecedented power, like a smooth river, not choppy but still flowing in the limbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a strange feeling that has never been seen before. Is it a certain degree of effect in meditation practice? Or is it the reason for immersing in the sunwell? Elder Clan is not saying that he can't use this power with his ‘dirty human body’? Is it nonsense or is he unclear? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
