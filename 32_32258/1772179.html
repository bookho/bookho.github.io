			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who claimed to be Lancelot’s voice fell directly to Hilton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just saw Asa’s tree looking over there and the look of weird Hilton and Jessica also came up. But at first glance, the two were suddenly stunned. When Lancelot looked at the voices here, the Hilton’s body fell off and fell. I still didn't get up on the ground. Hilton's mouth was beginning to be Hu Wei: "It's Lancelot. Fucking is the legendary Lancelot. How can the legendary paladin come here? There are so many people. ?* Want to level it up?" He suddenly thought of what he stood up and shouted at Asa. "Boss your face, your face. Run away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa also suddenly woke up from the excessive shock. The appearance of this group of people especially for the man named Lancelot gave him too much shock. What was originally expected was that two or three Necromancers couldn’t think of a Cardinal and the Knights of the Megatron, four Knights of the Temple and ten Templars. This immediately made all the plans he had prepared in his mind a mess. Thanks to Hilton's screaming at this time, the main goal of his Necromancer is the leaf of the world tree, and the goal of the Knights of the Temple is undoubtedly his six-headed wanted man who has revealed his original face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid and Bill’s old man turned to the direction of the elf’s place of residence as soon as he heard the voice of Lanster. They were also evil in the eyes of the city. As long as the pagan sorcerer is caught, it is also a dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot’s words undoubtedly made the elder elders in the depths of the forest react to the variability caused by the natural magic around the Knights of the Temple. However, their pace has not been accelerated because of the disappearance of obstacles, or their pace of momentum has never been affected by the changes of the outside world. It is still so unhurried, uncomfortable, and uncomfortable. It is only a blink of an eye. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa turned and jumped on another big tree by the Emperor. Looking at the last glimpse of the group, he saw two people besides Lancelot also turned his attention to him. One is Cardinal Adela, another one of the last ten Templars. He also smiled at Asa. It looks very friendly and very friendly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why this templar and the smile gave Asa no worse than Lancelot’s, but Asa was not shocked but A strange trick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Shenwei is like a prison with the majesty of the Lord." The voice of the Cardinal came to be clear and feminine without the slightest fireworks. But Asa’s body in midair was immediately stiff. It is no longer possible to control the body to fall on the branches like a piece of wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica has seen the Knights of the Temple since the tree began to squat until he sees Asa fall and jumps to the ground. Together with Hilton, I dragged the puppet-like Asa toward the Knights of the Temple and the other party ran in the opposite direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loud voice of the Knights of the Temple has been passed to the ears of every elf in the forest of Tulale, including the thieves who are running away and catching up. Luya also has always been half-enclosed to the moving black area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika has escaped from the thorns with the help of other thieves and carried Axis to the outside. It is unfortunate that the direction of their escape is exactly the direction of the Knights of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot’s words made all the thieves look terrified. Even more than just seeing the huge scorpion than the cow, I was even more afraid of even Hilika. Even if there is a hope for the encirclement of the prominent elves, I will never think that I will escape in the hands of so many Shrine Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Patrolman Kailin finally gathered again and pulled up the black bow on her hand. The arrow is still the same as the arrow that just shot down the Assad. This bow shoots the user's vindictiveness and strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eagle in the forest of the Sierra Leone. Only Kailin can practice vindictiveness. Besides, because the nature of the elves does not like fighting, it shows that her martial arts talent is quite brilliant. But just now she went all out and just pulled the long black bow out of the half and shot an arrow. After the fight and the body were exhausted to the bottom of the valley, I couldn’t think of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the goal of gathering her whole body of vindictiveness and strength is no longer wrong. She has already learned from the mouth of the surrounding elves that The big man of the muscle monster is the real culprits. Targeting to let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Hilika heard the voice of Lancelot and was already in a state of hysterical anger in the panic, but the instinct of immersion in killing and fighting for decades has still become this monster-like Part of the soul of the thug. No matter how irritating and violent the anger is, but almost instincted by the fighting and the crisis, he has been paying attention to the female elf who once helped him to shoot the unmanageable opponents. Before the Elf let go, he began to dodge and finally was not shot by the green light that could not be captured with the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just silently rubbing the side of the Helicia, the muscles that were hard to hurt, and the muscles that were hard to hurt were immediately smashed like mud. Then the body parts of the five thieves behind him also changed into a bowl with a large vacancy on the same straight line. A short head was completely missing. Two were missing. One was in the middle of the chest and there was a head and neck. Almost no one left, only a layer of skin and clothes were connected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thief silently slams a bloody rain and also sprinkles clean and silent. It seems that these are tangible and imaginary virtual images. same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘铛’. The deafening bang was the green light that came out of the Temple of the Knights. After passing through a few thieves, the detour did not reduce the Adelaide’s bishop in that direction. Fortunately, in the midst of the millennium, Lancelot waved the sword with a knife that had not yet come out of the sheath. This did not allow the cardinal to fall into the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The metal shards scabbard smash under this arrow. Lancelot’s body was also slightly surprised to see the Elf female patrol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Adelaide’s bishop responded to the face that had always been with a soft and soft smile, and then it’s pale and then a tidal wave. The female elf of the arrow glanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The thieves actually made a deadland area... It seems that the thieves behind it are not simple..." Lancelot frowned at the black front The geographical turn turned to Adela. "Please ask the bishop to dispel these evil things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adela closed his eyes and began to celebrate the prayer. Ten Templars and four Knights of the Temple have pointed their weapons at the red dress and asked the white magic to shine on them and condense on Adela's body. The white magical light of the gradually red cardinal illuminates to the point of dazzling and even his own outline is submerged in the glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...To restore the original purity with the glory of the Lord..." Adra sang the simplest prayer of white magic purification. This kind of low-level magic can be instantaneous as long as it is a bishop level, but Ade’s sings like a priest who just started learning white magic in one sentence. At the end of the prayer, he single-handedly pointed to the sky, but the soft and pure magical fluctuations and white light spurted him out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this white light, the black area is like a black smoke under strong winds, and it is dispelled without a trace. The scroll on the back of Aisisi was as fast as the ice in the furnace, and finally disappeared with the surrounding black areas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This white purification ray is far more than just dispelling the black area and radiating it to a farther and wider range with a hundred times of majesty and momentum. The viscous factors in the air restored the mutant venoms summoned by the original Elven Masters and immediately returned to the prototype under the volatility of purification. Even the dead wood guards were still rigid under the light. Even the magical enchantment of the entire elf seems to tremble under the magical magic of this large range of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adela returned to its original shape after the light. All the elves are watching him and even the thieves are looking at the cardinal like the gods of the light. But Adelas didn't care about these gaze. He was looking at a place where only a few dead wood guards were still moving the poisonous insects and still moving around with a green elf girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression on the face of the Cardinal has restored that kind of soft smile and even more gentle and better look. And there is light in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They seem to want to escape." Lancelot’s eyes were not noticed. Everything here was only locked in the back of the elves. Figure. "Adelk Kristen and I came to other people here to help the Adelaide bishop to solve these thieves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot and his nominated two The knight of the famous temple was suddenly added with the brilliance of the armor. The three white light strips in the air swept away in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
