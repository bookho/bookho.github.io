			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarians took only one day to turn the bustling commercial and manufacturing city of Westerly into a ruin. All the manufacturing workshops were completely destroyed by the jewels, and the equipment and materials that were stripped from the corpses were all collected and collected. The smashed cars were loaded with the animals and the lizards. Back to Tatalia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheist has a lot of ordinary people who can’t escape, but the barbarians don’t imagine them as a massacre. Gather together to drive away in the direction of the king city. The indiscriminate killing of civilians with no resilience is extremely shameful in the eyes of these barbarians who are self-proclaimed warriors. But they are looking for the aristocrats that are mixed in. Once they are immediately tied up and thrown into the pile of goods, they can be exchanged for the equivalent of gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streets are full of dead bodies left behind after the battle. Many large lizards are eating dragon flies while they are grouping together on some dead bodies. . After the battle, the barbarians searched for the pub to break into the underground dimple door and moved out of a large bucket of wine to scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of Taize in the camp outside the city is listening to two reports of the barbarians who are responsible for attacking here. It was he who led a large number of animal trainers and lizards to block the three reinforcements who came here and then rushed to defeat dozens of Griffin Knights. If it weren't for the extraordinary military talent of the king, Tatalia could never have gone so far this way to win it so thoroughly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the lizard patriarch, there are a few young aides who are not barbarians dressed up and a boss who seems to be honestly a grocery store owner. Middle-aged. These few people have been completely trusted by King Taize since the help of Ou Fulai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The warriors in the swamp's land have completely captured the opponents who have not been able to overcome the courage and anger of the northern warriors here. This is Titali. The greatest achievement in the history of Asia, your brave and leadership has covered the sun in the sky. It is as unique as the hurricane on Sandefers. Now we are less than three hundred miles away from the royal city of Elazia. Go all out and you can attack there in the next few days. You will be the first king of Tetaglia to conquer Elazia. "The barbarians who report the situation are in the red. It seems that they are drinking and dancing on the way. Some emotions can't be self-excited. The first time these warriors who lived in swamps and wasteland saw the richness of the plains of Elazia. This kind of complete conquest was so irritating to those who had no control. point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The kings of Elazia are stunned by the sinful sins that have been insulting us for many years. Your Majesty, please order the attack. The warriors of the north The axe and the blood are enough to destroy them. Let us stand at the top of those teachings and burn those church pigs to let Catherine's mother beg for mercy in your body." Another barbarian leads his eyes to be red. The voice is also hoarse and it seems that the Queen of Erasia is already under him. "All the warriors are eager for the blood of the enemy. I guarantee that their bravery will not let you down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young barbarian king nodded his face On the top, he said to the two leaders: "Okay. You all retreat. Command your abilities to take a good rest today. As for our next move, I will make a decision after consulting with several staff. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two barbarians had just left a golden shadow and flew into the camp very quickly and stopped at the middle-aged man around the king. . This is the slender body of the adult dragon fly. A transparent wing with two feet or so was unfolded like an enlarged cymbal. The degree and mobility of this large insect is no different from that of any bird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man carefully removed the one from the dragonfly and folded the small note. After looking at it, he said to the King of Taize: "Highland The 10,000 Cavalry has taken the lead in withdrawing and is coming all out to gallop here. It has now arrived in Pingsburg. It is expected to arrive in two days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thai King Ze looked at the middle-aged man with a smile and said: "Thanks to Mr. Anderson and his companions, we can understand the situation of the battle situation so clearly. I can't think of the fly that we have been breeding for hundreds of years. It is only in the hands of Druid that I can play such a big role. I promise that the faith of Druid will definitely grow up in the country of the swamp in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young man did not appear to be happy or grateful for the weight of the king. Just a little bit nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid Anderson is coming to Tatalia through the introduction of Oufu. Druid’s faithful country, such as Erasia, was originally a heresy and some accidental incidents made him involved in the plan of Oufu, which has now been wanted by Elasia. After completing his mission to Asshon, he did not intend to participate in the war between Oufu and the coalition forces. Leading some Druid companions to Tatalia but did not expect that through the arrangement and recommendation of Cedrus, he and his companions are now the reds in the eyes of King Taize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former Druids became the only group of casters in Tatalia after the death of the former court magician and shadow sage. Although their spells can't catch up with the former Shadow Sage Masters, they have a hundred times more effect on Tataglia than the two magicians. They not only let the production of dragon flies and swamp lizards explode in a short period of time, but also use a dense method to make a swamp vine become tougher so that the barbarians who have been used to fighting in bare arms have not lost to the regular troops of Elazia. Protective gear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid has been suppressed by the church for many years until this time, he really found a place to show his talents. Although Anderson himself is not interested in this fame, but The vast majority of the Druids under his command were the young people who suddenly came to the excitement and let them devote themselves wholeheartedly to the enthusiasm for the contribution of Tatalia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a flexible transmission of news through the dragonfly. In the strategic and tactical distribution, the barbarians even have the upper hand, so that they can flexibly converge when the troops of Elazia are not assembled. Each breaks. And three messages came today. It also gives them a clearer picture of the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the news just received, the two troops in the West are also rushing to the news. King Taize asked the young man next to him: "The two leaders just heard the morale of our swamp warriors. They are eagerly eager to see me continue to attack. What do you think we should do?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a young man who immediately went forward and said, "Your Majesty must not venture in. In fact, it is already very lucky to be able to attack Westerly. The army of Erasia can’t gather together. It was only broken by us. Now the king of the city is the most elite knights in the kingdom. If the situation is urgent, Celeste will have a reinforcement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "There is a need for two * divisions to reverse the situation. Although our dragonfly has a huge advantage in dealing with ordinary soldiers, especially archers, it is unbearable in front of any large range of high-level magic. "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no spellcaster in our team, although the combat power of the warrior is unquestionable, but this flaw is in the case of combating Elijah's elite. Will change It’s the cause of the injury. And the reason why the Knights of the Kingdom did not attack to rescue Westerly was also obvious. They just had to wait for the troops on the eastern highlands to withdraw the reinforcements and the west side of the Nigan border. As long as the two sides of the reinforcements arrived and they attacked together, we must There will be a negative situation on the three sides of the card."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And in terms of strength, we are also in absolute disadvantage. The army of Elazia is fully assembled. It’s the last good opportunity for us to retreat. The two reinforcements are all from afar. If they don’t trim the collection, they will never dare to pursue it. And our army can’t withdraw the cavalry in Elasia in the swamp area. Chasing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some anxious words between the young people. From the two barbarians, they all see that these fighters continue to attack now. How strong is the ** but it is definitely not the offense. It is the withdrawal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have to worry, I know that we really have to retreat and this war has given Tatalia an unprecedented gain." King Taize ordered. Nodded and stood up and looked at the young staff in the surrounding area and said, "What do you know about the biggest gains of our Tatalia in this war?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Naturally, so much material has been seized. The material that was plundered and sent back to Tatalia is equivalent to the income of Tenalia for ten years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The blow to Erasia is also an unprecedented result, even if the army of Erasia did not suffer any fatal blow. But commercial agriculture has been devastated along the way. Counting their empty use of waste I am afraid that food and human resources will not recover in a few years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The animal trainer army also got a good chance to fight the fighting power of the dragonfly and the lizard. The combat methods can be used more skillfully. In the future battles, you can certainly play more. The role of "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;A few young people were somewhat flattered and said: "We have only fulfilled our responsibilities for our awards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a prize. If it is not your planned tactical arrangement The strategy of this battle can never have such a complete victory. The most important thing is to let me really understand. The fearless warrior is useful on the battlefield, but the more important thing is always outside the battlefield. The mind is not the muscles and the courage. This is probably the reason why Tatalia has been suppressed by Elasia for many years. Now with your help, just give me ten years of time. Asia will definitely become a strong country that can compete with the Elazia Chamber.” The appearance of King Taize is a bit ridiculous, but at the moment his expression and voice are only the kind of spirit that only the real king and leader will have. . "You will all be the hope of the rise of Tatalia. I know that you are all cultivated by Mr. Cedros. But I assure you that Tatalia will definitely be the best place for you to display your talents. He gives you It will never let you down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your trust." These young people are somewhat moved. The intrinsic concept of the people of Tetaglia is extremely exclusive. Someone has already gained the trust of their kings in the past, but they are only dissatisfied with the fact that they are only following the rules of Cedrus. On the auxiliary King of Taize. The barbarians don’t have much in mind to become a staff member who can analyze the situation in the brave and arrogant people. And now the words of King Taize are officially acknowledged their importance to recognize their status in Tetaglia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The order is to take a day off today. The whole army will retreat tomorrow. To let them prepare more forage, we can only leave a real ruin for Erasia. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same time Celeste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope Magnus is listening to reports from the wild heights to the priests when he heard that one of the most elite heavy cavalry was in a curse When the smoke was gone, it just wrinkled and screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the fact that we and several * divisions came to see the curse of the curse may be from the whistle valley and the wanted criminal who will use the necromantic magic In the camp of Oufudi. If you are behind the group of evil necromancers behind Oufu, then everything is hard to predict, so I will come and ask for it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It shouldn't be." The Pope said faintly. His voice is not big, but "the back of Oufu should not be the Descartes. So is there a forbidden scroll?" The priest of the pope squinted sideways and looked at the Adela bishop standing next to him. "What do you think is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe...maybe they...who came from somewhere..." suddenly asked The look and sound of the cardinal is somewhat unnatural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope’s kneel nodded and said quietly: “Oh? It seems that Cedros’s luck is so good that even this kind of thing can be accidentally obtained. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a few cold sweats on the face of the cardinal who stood there, but he also thought about it and said, "Your Majesty is based on their curse." The description. I can judge that it should be the shadow magic of Nitta Bass, the Shadow Sage of Tadalia. It is a variant of the Necromancer. It is said that Oufu’s General Gru helps Prince Taize to kill him. Lost the shadow sage, this may be the curse scroll that was obtained at that time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that. So the Descartes should have nothing to do with the Europeans. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. It must be related to Deva Valley."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, that is, the scroll of the curse is the only one of the Europeans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe?" His Majesty the Emperor's eyes not cold but the Cardinal got the feeling from the rest of the skin layer of goose bumps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Er...maybe...and." Adela's face looked cloudy and finally said: "I heard that the tower of the five towers of the tooth In the middle of the Yanta Tower, the owner of Ai Si Rui has been missing for some time. It is said that someone once saw him finally appearing in General Oufu, near Oufu in the Karundo Basin. It is said that Aisrey* There is also a curse scroll worn by the teacher's year... It seems to be the flame curse 'Meteor Fire Rain'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope is hearing the 'Meteor Fire When the word 'rain' was used, the face finally changed. Then he sighed and shook his head and said to himself: "These guys don't have the ability to use them. Don't make these things indiscriminately. Where do the real strong people need these?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
