			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's just a lie to me to find the bait of the lost dragon blood. Don't always think in a self-righteous way, little guy, use Your morality is to measure the creatures that are lower than you are self-righteous, and it is foolish to measure creatures higher than you. If a mouse thinks you are mean and thinks that you do not meet its principle, would you care?" Moriel touched his chin and made a thoughtful expression. "And in a sense, you should have died. And I don't think you are damn, but Akibad thinks you are damned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What?” Hearly, he heard it very clearly, but from the feeling he was just more confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know what this Akibad seal is? Do you think that with his human power, you can easily deal with me?" Morrill Pointing at the black jewel in the center of the magic array. "That was the power of the soul of the Dark Star at the expense of half of his magical power and half of the life of his elf lover. This created a seal that I couldn't break."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only the Dark Will Guardian with the brand of the Dark Star in the body of Akibad, and then practiced the meditation of Akibad, then all his The blood can release some of the power of this seal.” Moriel pointed to the frozen hole at the top of the cave. "That channel is specially arranged by Akibad. He told me that the person who came down from this passage is the necromancer who practiced his meditation. Akibad left this road. I want to kill "The people who came down from this road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have completely practiced his meditation, even if you go to accept the branding, it will only be dark with it. The will merges.” Morrier sighed with regret and looked at Asa with a pity. "Your body actually has the vitality of the leaves of the world tree like Akibad. It is the best key to open the seal. It's a pity... the details on your key are completely reversed..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out that I was going to cut your head, but I am quite a good person for you. So I only cut your wrist and found you. The blood actually does not have the effect of releasing the seal... Your luck is really good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stands and swears. Then he suddenly sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, can you tell me what is going on here." Asa looked at Moriel, and there was no more anger and fear in his eyes. "As long as you tell me to let me know, I will dispose of it with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, interesting little guy." Moriel looked at Asa, in the eyes Showing a look of interest, she thought about it and nodded. "Okay. Since you are useless to me. Then I can really give you some rewards. I can tell you something. But before you have to tell me something, you haven’t been human for some years. Talk to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to know?" Asa asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Central Mountain Range... No, in your words, it should be on the highland near the Sandefes Mountains, and an orc should have been established. Let's have a tribe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa. Nod: "You are talking about Oufu? Right. But it is not a tribe. It is already a big city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oufu?" Moriel Coldly snorted, a stream of intense yellow smell rushed out of her mouth. "But it’s just the beast slaves who have gathered the blood of the giants. They actually borrowed the name of the giant territory. The reptiles called Sedros are really arrogant.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Know the city of Sedros? "Asa is stunned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Be a knowledgeable guy, know a lot of things, and talked to me more than ten years ago. But the reptile is now better pleading not to let me see him again. "Mollyton paused, and seemed to think about it before he continued. "He should have a companion, a half-elf, a black eye, which is probably strong from a human perspective. Do you know?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cognitive, and very familiar. "Asa nodded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mollier didn't die..." Sedros frowned, his fingers pounding on the table, the desk of the black scented sandalwood A monotonous flutter. This is a high-grade wood that is transported from the depths of the marsh. In other parts of the mainland, this is the material used to make jewelry, which is more expensive than gold.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten Lancelot, the Knights of the Temple," asked Sedros. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Escape? How is it possible, I will give you the reel... ..." Sedros's face was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reel should have been completely used. The Marquez sacrifice I sent was not too strong. But there is no problem with strain and wit. But I I don't know why, they finally escaped. And there was a Knight of the Temple who was stalking when my family attacked the Black Elves, and used a curse scroll."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a paradise for purgatory? The scroll is almost a treasure of the Glorious Castle. I don't think Magnus is willing to give it..." The look of Seyce and Lost is somewhat weird. He naturally knows that this powerful magic scroll is in the hands of the church, and it is one of the biggest scruples in his mind. Now that this scroll has been used in Nigan, it is reasonable to say that he can breathe a sigh of relief, but he also knows that the Pope will be able to use it if he is willing to use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the time we were fighting fiercely with the army of the Black Elves, and tens of thousands of people were dying under the curse. Our elite troops have almost lost their lives. Not only that, but there is also a Dafa sneak into our rear porcelain to kill the women and children, and also destroyed the temple of the horns...” The priest of Tema was silent for a while, closed his eyes and seemed to be brewing or hesitating. Then he blinked and sighed a long breath and said. "This time I have something to ask you for a favor..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sedros is not hesitant to consider, very simple answer: "No problem, my friend. What are your requirements despite mentioning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So far, Moriel will never let go of my people and eagle The banshee. I and the eagle-female chieftain, Basile, have already escaped from Nigan, but we have not gone there..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem "My friend." Sedros still didn't hesitate. This old man who is as good as a young man is now acting like a young man with a bloody and arrogant attitude. "Oufu now has enough resources and land to accommodate friends of any race. And our system is also loose enough and free, there is absolutely no such belief and concept of the church country, since we are all ogres, werewolves here. , half-orc, then how do you care about the Tauren and the harpy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of Tima seems to have never expected that Sedros would be so After he stumbled, he bent down and gave a gift to the old man in front of him. He said with a grateful voice: "The horns are on, your friendship will definitely win the respect and gratitude of all the Tauren. In our eyes, Even the whole human<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is not comparable to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're welcome, my Friends. For our friendship for many years, this is just a hand-picked effort.” Sedros smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But..." Tima priest snorted and let go of his voice and continued. "That... that person... Moriel's adopted son...Gru...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence the voice of the high priest is very low, his thick The whisper-like tone is actually used in the daytime. There are no other people in the huge city owner's office. This is not because he deliberately lowered his voice. It is said that when this person thinks of this person, a kind of natural anti-tip from the heart seems to be afraid of touching something dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sedros looked in his eyes and looked at the ceiling and thought about it with a smile. "It should be okay, everything that Nie has had has nothing to do with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... Where is he now? Don’t you have to tell him first?" The high priest was relieved and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is not in Oufu, has been in the Sandefes for some time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sang and Fes Mountain Range? There..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, if it is not the time you are there, it is too tight, if you can slow down for a while, this The second action will never fail.” Sedros suddenly sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
