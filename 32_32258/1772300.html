			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai’s mother smiled and said, “I don’t say it now, but you should know when you see him.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why didn't you give this hilt to this person at the beginning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Needless to say, Ronis is self-righteous A sense of justice, I am afraid that Sandro will not agree to give the hilt to the guy. Now I have no choice but to make this choice. Except for the guy’s residence, there is really no place to put this. In addition to him, probably no one can afford to save this thing.” Ai’s mother turned and found a map from the cupboard. "But if you follow the normal route, you are unlikely to be there. You can follow the route of this map and go to the Nigan ground first......."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Asa took the map and collected it, sighing long. "If this is finally the case, I am really satisfied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong? Tired?" Ai's mother's smile is a little ridiculous. the taste of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can’t be tired. From the beginning I was at large, because the things that were on my head were too heavy to afford and I didn’t want to bear. But when I later decided not to escape. When I faced all things positively, I found that I could only continue to escape in the way I faced. My mother knows that it is not my habit to escape."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." Aier's mother nodded. "But you have to escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there is Enemy, I can go to fight." Asati took the small pocket on the hand, and the black handle's hilt had already been in the middle. "But for this thing, maybe all the people in the world can be my enemies, even if it is not now, it is difficult to protect it later? People will change..... Can I put all that might have an attempt? People have killed? So I have to escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A legendary artifact that can become the king of the world, and now outside the Diya Valley, This will definitely make some people very interested. Although people who are interested in becoming the king of the world should not be innumerable, after all, it is unlikely that a pawn will be public. As long as you have the ability to be interested, it will never be small for the sake of this interest. Jia Wei is already a good example, and he is already insignificant relative to the Pope and the Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this artifact corresponds to the power of the sun well in his body, so he can’t get out of this vortex, and he can’t face so much Opponent, so he can only escape. Escaped very depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as it is not your own heart, you can't see the goal now? I can tell you, you don't have to escape anymore." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Don't run away. Knowing that this has nothing to do with me, I am much more relaxed. Just send this thing safely. Nigan, I was completely free." Asa suddenly saw a moment, he remembered something, took a small pocket from his waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small pocket is full of white powder. Asa carefully found a black gem and sent it to Ai's mother. "Mother, you help me find out what this is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come you have this thing?" Aier's mother-in-law changed her face. Even when she saw the hilt of the Dark Star, her face did not have such a large fluctuation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Pope’s study, only the Pope and the Marquis, even the Adelaide and Lancelot who stood behind the Pope were not there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Tamek Knight I sent to snatch the leaves of the world tree is dead." The Pope quietly looked at the new Cardinal in front of him, directly Said intermittently. There is no fear that he will send the Tamik Knight to this purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversation between smart people will be very simple, especially smart when everyone knows that it’s a boring trick. The conversation at this time can be said to be as candid as two honest gentlemen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no omission, even I have to sigh. This is just an accident, not a problem with your plan." The Marquis is faint Say. He also did not have the slightest ridicule. Things that have already happened are not enough to become a psychological barrier that hinders progress in the future. He himself knew that he was still very useful to the pope, and the pope was also very useful to himself. Everyone knows each other. The Marquis can understand this when he can walk into the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand that it is second to use the leaves of the world tree to slap me, but the talents like the Knights of Tamik are not very good to find." The Marquis nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not just this. I was hoping to have the leaves of the world tree and to hold the elves in my hands, at least to offset the gap between Oufu and Oufu. It seems that it is now a discord. The enchantment of the whispering forest has been fully convinced. The enchantment of the Elven War ancient tree and the Sun Well is a place that is not broken. The breath of the first two days, you should also feel it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the direction of the whispering forest. How can things appear in the whisper of the whisper. Do you know?" Marquis thought for a moment, nodded: "I think it is probably that Sand has taken out a good thing. "Can you continue to be placed in the Magic Academy? But I don't think he dares to put that thing in the whispering forest. Once the elves know it will definitely be tossed, he does not want to see it. So can you guess where he will put things? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis shook his head: "If he had a way to completely seal the dark fluctuations of the hilt." I really don't know where he will collect the sword. "There was a silence for the Pope," said Ronald and Sandro. And the seal of the Necromancer and the well water of the Sun Well made a spell, and made a secret room that could suppress the fluctuation of the Black Star. Finally, I had to resort to other magical enchantments, as well as the daily priest in the Cathedral of the Magic Academy. The spiritual power of our prayers will keep them sealed. Now Ronis is no longer there. That enchantment can't be made anyway, he has only one way to seal it completely... Do you know what it is? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ring of the last Pope Deken. "The Marquis answered immediately.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Well, you should know these things. "The face of His Majesty the Pope is slightly fluctuating, but not too big, at least<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; illustrates the honesty of the Marquis in front of him. "This thing should be in Agriel Hands. But unfortunately, I am completely without the old news of this old friend...." The Pope seems to ask with a question: "Is it because of Hamm?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I know the whereabouts of the mainland's first killer? "The Marquis smiled a bit.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if I have her whereabouts now, there may be no way." As early as twenty years ago, the siege of the twelve-templar knights at the time was able to retreat from the whole body. I really couldn't think of any way to get back the ring from her hand. "The Pope smiled a bit.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Fortunately, as the acting president of Diya Valley, she will not be as hard as Sandru, following the necromancer of the Necromancer. in principle. I only hope that she will not take over the handle of the Dark Star to keep it, but this is just hope. Now that the hilt is beyond control, there is now only control over what can be controlled..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis suddenly said, "Kiss you down. Is it worrying that the prophecy of Archibald's adults... The appearance of the black-skinned hilt, perhaps indicating that the real dark star is not far away...."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, of course I am worried about this. The Pope nodded and admitted without any disguise. He immediately said: "Inham, I know that you are also not interested in realizing the prophecy of Akibad. Yes, otherwise you will not stop Jarvi on the same day." It is. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis nodded, smiled: "Yes, if the Dark Star is really broken, as a member of the Diya Valley, you must not go to the dead." The king of the king. I think that except for Shante, Sandru, who only knows the words of Agibad, no one likes to be commanded by something that might be just a monster. This is actually the common opinion of most Necromancers of the day, but now, almost all of me are left alone. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you are not the kind of person who is obsessed with power, who can be overwhelmed by power and interests, and will not pursue things that they cannot get their hands. And it is not blindly obsessed with what the sages have learned, and they are arrogant. Although you have accepted the brand of the Dark Star, but it is a special one of all Necromancers, so I always appreciate you, will let you join Celeste, will sit here with you to discuss . "The Pope smiles and looks at the Marquis.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
