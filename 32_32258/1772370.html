			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whispered elf elder Luya's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ada Brother is waiting for this world tree leaf to save lives, I will never lie to you..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luya bit her lip and thought for a while, and then said, "Do you ask me to come out and discuss it with you alone?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai Mei did not speak any more, but his face was already white. She whipped up her strength and said: "Do you want to kill Asa?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power of the world tree leaf and the sun well was originally intended to destroy the darkness. The one used by the star is my mission. He has seized the power that belongs to me. It is fate. So the result will be borne by him. This is his mission.” Luya’s eyes are all strange confusion. It’s not so much to say that she is reciting a code of conduct that has nothing to do with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I...I thought you would save the big brother of Asa..." Ai Mei said with a buried head. She had already seen that the young elder elder had a very unusual feeling for Asa, which was why she came to the whispering forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to save him but the leaves of the world tree are not mine. It is the sacred object of our elves and the fate of the big 6 so this is not my wish. Unwilling questions." Luya turned around and stopped watching Ai Yimei coldly. "Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I can't let Asha die anyway." A hard thing suddenly came from behind to Luya's waist. on. Luya looked back and saw Ayimei’s hand on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a trick that is well made and small. Ai Yimei snorted: "You don't move, don't call me the poison and curse on the things I got from the Necromancer. Even if I cut a little skin, no one can stand it. I don't want to kill. You."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, Luya sighed for a long time and said nothing, and there was no sign of resistance. The back came to the top of the war tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two had never encountered any elves in a log cabin on a huge war-torn tree. The large mage gown is enough to hide the small arrow. The two seem to be walking very close, but there is still a girl magician who can't think of a hand-free chicken. There is a courage to hijack an elder elder in the whisper of the ban. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves of the world tree are placed on the altar of the most central part of the ancient tree of war. The ancient trees of war have been completely bred under the watering of the Sun Well. The ancient genie empire has been used to deal with the dragons and the Titans. The altar of the war has dozens of huge dead wood warriors in addition to the war. There are dozens of strangely shaped branches that are enough to deal with the magic weapon of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely no one will have the guts to face these things to snatch the leaves of the world tree, so the elves don’t seem to have much vigilance. Some see Luya’s elders nodding. salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai Mei’s heart beats very quickly. The huge dead wood warriors around there are strange branches that are unclear but definitely powerful. This can be turned into a bolognese in any of them. She fixed her voice and said to Luya: "Go and give me the leaves of the world tree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is useless to you. Even now around People don't pay attention to me. As long as I pick up the world tree, someone will ask. Elder Lloyd has returned. Even I don't have the right to use the leaves of the world tree. And even if you give it to you, you can't go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you give it to me." Ayimei held the transfer reel in her arms with one hand and one hand, and she was already ready. . The enchantment of the sun well can prevent all magic from being only the space magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luya silently hesitated and finally took Ai Mei to the center of the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop it." A white elf suddenly appeared on the shoulders of a dead wood warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai Yimei stepped forward and stepped on Luya’s neck and watched the old elf with vigilance. The other elves at the top of the ancient tree also saw that all the screams were screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you talking about?" Ai Mei did not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not talking to you little girl. Do you really think that you can really go to this place with the little gadget in your hand?" Elder Lloyd did not care about Ai Mei, but Luya, who was taken by Ai Meimei, sighed and shook his head and said, "Do you want to take the leaves of the world tree by the hand of this little girl? I really Some disappointment is not even the last time you can't pass this. Do you remember the teachings of Mafa?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luya has some confusion I bowed and said, "I'm sorry, I just had a big idea. This little girl is a disciple of Master Aidelide. Her brother has also helped us..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "And I don't have to talk about nonsense. I know what you are thinking about doing something stupid." The old elf shook his head very simply but his voice was very light except for the closer Ai Meimei. The elves can't hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't care how you want to return the leaves of the world tree to me or I will kill her." Ai Mei suddenly took the 弩 from the sleeves It came out to the head of Luya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves around are screaming. Many people have also taken out the bows and other weapons they carry with them. Only Elder Lloyd is still not busy and said: "Don’t be stupid. The little girl is not too embarrassed to see the two tower owners in the Tower of Tooth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't care if you are not embarrassed, I just want the world. The leaves of the tree don't force me to do anything now." Ayimei shook her hand with her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You dare not do it. Don't forget that this is a whispered singer. You are still standing on the top of the sun well." Elder Lloyd smiled Point it by hand. The shit that was on the hand of Ai Meimei suddenly changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the wooden parts on the squat and on the arrow are all blossoming with long leaves. It’s just a blink of an eye. Ai Mei’s hand is not a weapon but a bunch of potted plants. The stringed string of the machine, which was stretched out, suddenly shook a large group of flowers and plants all over the sky, and the metal parts were smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Meimei bites his teeth toward the world tree leaves on the altar but the ground on the top of the tree suddenly pops out dozens of vines with arms The moment was intertwined into a cage to shut her in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves around were relieved. Elder Lloyd jumped off the shoulders of the dead wood warrior and walked over to Rua’s side and patted her shoulder and said softly: Don't think too much. You haven't said it yourself. This is his fate. Since he has that power, he should take responsibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Are you really eavesdropping?" Luya looked strangely at Elder Ai Mei. The conversation between the two of them was within the scope of the ancient tree of war. It was really easy to use one of the many functions of the ancient war tree. But Luya did not expect that Elder Lloyd would stop their conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am worried about you." Elder Lloyd shrugged with a pun. "When the little girl came to you, I saw that her application was not normal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old elf immediately sighed again and he was different. Like aging, his words also have vicissitudes that other elves don't have: "I understand that I understand your feelings. But you have to know that he is just a personal class. Human life is very short, even if he is not dead now." Sixty years will also die. If the little girl said it is true that he died early in the past five or six decades, but the whole six can have five or six hundred years of quiet time, including my elves."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand that I always understand..." Luca whispered blankly and replied over her head. In the cage of the rattan, Ayimei has already fallen to the ground and cried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are intruders!" An elf in charge of the scouting image on the distant branch suddenly shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What? Where did you come from? Where?" Elder Lloyd asked his voice not to panic. After the misunderstanding of the war with the Tower of the Last War, the scope of the war tree has spread to the limit covering the area of ​​ten miles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Suddenly here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just here?" Lloyd Elder And all the elves were watching the surroundings with vigilance but did not see any anomalies. “Suddenly? How is it possible?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
