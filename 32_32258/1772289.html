			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind him, the old tree buried in the little thing was silent and the dam collapsed. The huge tree body, countless branches and leaves together turned grayish black powder down, and buried that thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the breath is not buried. This is clearly silent, colorless and tasteless, but it can make any life feel black, and the feeling of greatness and death is constantly diverging and diffusing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right side of the sword has come out side by side, blood is like a spring, but this kind of injury seems to be nothing compared to the back. The sword cut off most of the back muscles, four ribs, and even a part of the spine. If it weren't for the black knife to break the templar to nail out the templar, the sword could split him into two pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin did not dodge, he did not expect the Templars behind him to gather. But even if it is expected, he will not dodge, because this is the only opportunity to create opportunities for Asa in the magic trap, and the only chance to save Talis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thamik Knight and Asa’s figure have been reunited together, carrying a knife around the knife and turning it into a black chasing into the distance. Going in the forest, from the last feeling of the right hand, the good sword in the Tamik Knight is not heavy. The chance of naturally sacrificing the whole arm may not be great, but there is no way, his own strength. I can only do this to the point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only one hand pulls the dagger from the waist and draws on Talis, the rope that binds the knight is broken, but this action is his All the strengths of the toes are all used. No one can break the muscles of the back with nearly half of the muscles. The Yabin can even feel that his lungs are breaking and ribs. Jumped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to die? Git.....I am dying.....how could it.....I don't want to die.....I don't want to.....git.....no way? ..<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abbie’s mouth is actually a bitter smile at this time, he took a deep breath, and Talis is still leaning on him. The golden hair has a few ripples on his face, and Abin’s hand has the light of purifying, which is the last white magic to go all out. His hand pressed on the body of Talis, and then the body slowly fell down. Even if he could endure the pain caused by this huge wound, the blood that had already accumulated a large pool on the ground had exceeded The limit of man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purification is just right, the magical power of the imprisonment in the body is dissipated, that is the prohibition of the magical force in the body of the Tamik Knight, in the body After a cool wash like a wash, the power of being imprisoned resumed, and at the same time, I woke up with thoughts. Talis held the Abin, who was going to fall down softly, wondering, sadness, fear, and incredulously occupied all Expressions and moods. These incomparable feelings can't find a suitable direction. She doesn't understand what is going on in front of me, because of what. She thinks she is going crazy, and it seems to be crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abin, Yabin, what is going on?" Talis only felt that she was holding a large sponge soaked in blood, Wen The hot blood turns to the hand and makes it hot. The white magic she tried to do was just a drop in the bucket of a wound that was as big as a crack without a wound, and it didn't work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abinate opened his mouth and couldn’t make any sound. He could only look at the direction of the Templar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Templar is just awakened from this series of shocks. Seeing that the Tamik Knight and the opponent did not fall into the woods, his companion was actually nailed to the tree by the knife thrown out of the volley. He actually only took a breath of time. I knew what I should do, and he rushed toward Talisbin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judgment of the Templar is not wrong. In this case, it is really necessary to take the shot first. These two people are already undoubted enemies, and both of them have no weapons. This is the best chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what he was wrong with was the reaction of Talis. Talis put down the Abin, didn't pick up the sword and didn't take any fighting action, but jumped like a street rogue and grabbed the blade, while the blade cut her own almost at the same time. The fist also hit the face of the Templar. The foot also kicked on the sacred warrior's file. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The templar issued a scream of pigs that were killed by death. The body threw a curve in the air and flew out, then fell to the ground and did not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis did not pay attention to the blood of his hands. I didn’t even think about how I had just killed the Templar in the past. She quickly took out a scroll in her own arms. That was one of the few reels she had left when she left Celeste. It was said to be the scroll of the ‘God of Art’ made by His Majesty the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reel expansion. White and warm as jade's magical power slowly fell on Abin. The magic scrolls made by the top white magician like this is absolutely top-notch. It can be said that even half of the dead people can save their lives under this magic. But Abin is not half dead. But more than half of the deaths are almost completely dead. The blood from his wounds is enough for a person to bathe. The sword behind him has hurt a lot of internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the curse of the necromancer on the Tamik Knight's Knife has begun to erode to the whole body. However, under the influence of this top healing magic, he slowly opened his eyes and spit out a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No need to waste, I may be dead....." This is the first sentence after Abin’s wake-up, he feels, in the body The vitality has broken. These magical powers are huge, but they are only temporarily filled in with these breaks, and they cannot be connected. It is white magic that flows through the blood vessels, and the ribs that are broken by the heart are also temporarily filled by white magic. The curse of Necromancer is constantly weakening all functions in the body. Unless there is a cardinal in person here, it is impossible to return to the sky with this single reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this going back? Abin? You.....why are you doing this?" Talis was squatting beside him, shaking ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can only do this....." Abin’s voice swallowed, his throat twitching, and he should have coughed up a blood. But there is no blood in the body that can cough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You.....you" Talis has no idea what to say. She wants to ask him why he betrayed him, and he wants to ask him why he will kill her like this in the end. But when she saw him like this, she couldn’t ask it anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to help Asa Big Brother....." Although Talis did not say it herself, Abin did not know that they were originally hostile. What kind of relationship between people is, but through the Tamika Knight to threaten Asa with her, and some conversations between the two, he also vaguely knows that these two people should be all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I.....I can't leave you....." Talis looked at Abin in disappointment. White magic has begun to overflow from the shoulders of his broken shoulders, which is a manifestation of the inability of magic to function fully. This can be seen with the white magic of the body of the dead. His body is already starting to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to join you, I am hurting you....." Tears have flowed out of Talis's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, if you didn't want me to join, the Tamik Knight might not let me go.....help me a favor... .. If you can..... help me take care of my sister....." Abin tried to squeeze a smile, his pupil has begun to scatter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis quickly nodded, and then saw the smile on Abin’s face slowly stretching, like a flower squeezed hard. After losing the hand, the power of restraint is lost, and it is slowly spreading and falling. It is clear that the last point of vitality is breaking and dissipating from his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He died, and Talis felt very clearly. Then she felt as if one hand had caught her heart and twisted, and the tears fell big. This is the first time in her memory. Before that, she didn't even know that she would cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forest, the Tamik Knight is still chasing, and will soon catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the significance of this escape? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Asa, who was running away in front, the Tamek Knight now can’t help but drop a little, although two advanced healing spells make him barely recover. The force of action, but how slow is it and where can Sri Lanka stumble? This is completely meaningless struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
