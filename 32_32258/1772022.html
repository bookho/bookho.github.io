			<div id="content">Dark caves, crystallized with dripping drops of wet rock, black waterdrops in the dark environment become the only brilliance, falling back on the hard stalagmites, and bursting out of the last low ticking... tick ...this is the only melody in the cave of Osaki<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am flying fast in the caveSharp rocks and loose gravel can't be my obstacles. The intricate road is the most dangerous labyrinth, but I know exactly where hidden traps are hidden and where there are hidden beasts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light jump, I am the supreme master of the Nigen world, the only darling of the Shadow Dragon, the owner of rights and power, the elegant and proud spokespersonDrow<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;好吧I admit that I am deceiving myself.The titles of awe and fear are all said by the priests. I never thought that I have such honors. I am just a declining drow.There is no territory, no slaves, no God's favor, no other drow's awe, and the founder and the creator of the worst performance of the apprenticeship appraisal. The reason why I can still live peacefully until now is not in the dark corner. The poisoned dagger cuts the throat, or is dragged onto the altar and staggered under ridiculous gaze, completely because I can’t pose a threat to other families.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light black shadow stopped and violently breathed, sweat oozing from the forehead, across the soft cheeks and flowing into the deep groove of the chest along the slender neck. inThe exquisite sacrificial robes are slightly messy, and the silk-cut open hem opens to the waist, and the delicate thighs that are exposed are over-sported and the owner of the shadow has a delicate face, and the soft eyebrows are now slightly Wrinkling, adding a bit of anger<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annoyed thighs, even if I don’t take the martial arts as a standard, my body is bad.After rushing for half an hour, I have reached the critical point of physical strength.Take a break, there is no way to pursue the soldiers behind.But who will come to pursue my useless sacrificial apprentice? It’s a waste of power. I laughed at myself, my thoughts drifted back half an hour ago...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was awakened by sudden shocks.Put on the robes and find the whole Oslo chaos after going out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quickly stop himStop him soon"Cui Hanna's mother shouted like crazy."I am completely surprised that the mother-in-law’s misbehaving behavior is completely stunned by the sight of hell.There are fires, explosions, corpses, screams and deaths everywhere.There are also huge stones from the top of the cave, and the largest city of the drow, Othello, is becoming a ruin in the sea of ​​fire...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes have passed, There is no sign that the disaster has to stop."The mother-in-law ordered the man to break through and defend to find a way to go to the cave of Morrison." A male drow rides a black dragon and sings and summons the slaves and soldiers. "All the sacrifices go to the temple to guard the mother." Take care of the craftsmen and slaves to let them fend for themselves!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you have to go to the temple? Are you going to help or seek asylum?" humble male Actually stopped my way, angry and despised him. "You dare to question me male." "To break through the enemy's blockade. Any factors that may drag the troops should be ruled out. This is my duty." This male drow looked at me. There is no trace of respect and fear in the eyes. It is full of disdain and scornful corners. It seems to ridicule my incompetence<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can live At the end of the battle, you will face my anger." I left behind and turned to the nearest city gate. I know that he knows that I can’t threaten him at all. Although he is a humble civilian male and I Is a distinguished woman Sacrifice, but as a declining aristocrat, did not pass the final test. I can't beat the first family martial arts master. He won the love of the mother. No family will be offended for the sake of my mother and if I use the drow way to solve in the dark. Everything that was discovered the next day is definitely me, not him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next half hour, I have been running into the maze-like cave as much as possible. Stay away from Othello away from the Taurens and those nasty guys until they can't run anymore. The rugged roads in the world of Nigan have countless complexities and chaos like Medusa's tangled hair, even the Dark Elves. I will walk through the dark labyrinth but I am different for the dark labyrinth near Othello. I am familiar with my own back garden. Because I am ridiculed and crowded every time in Othello, I like to leave the city and leave the gathering. Wandering in a less dangerous place near the city, letting the cold wind between the caves blow away the sadness in my heart<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know When I was in front of my eyes, there was a blur of water. If you were discovered by others, there should be a new ridiculous topic. The apprentices who shed tears didn’t know why the ugly face of the first martial arts came out again and the wicked male was dirty. All the shameless shame is because the men are all because of the rebellion in 12 years. My family has been removed from Othello since the rebellion. Only I am struggling as the last descendant. I saw it with my own eyes. The slave of my great lady cursed and set fire everywhere and looted. I saw my sister’s most favored near-serving spear and stabbed him in bed. The men’s plots have been used for a long time, with a dazzling conspiracy to decorate the shameless conspiracy with a mean kneeling slave. Concealing the ugly and shameless male I cursed you! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?" The surprised voice pulled me back to the real world. I was flustered and looked at the place where I heard the sound. The teardrop on my face was a human male wearing a delicate armor with a milky white glow. The hair is so conspicuous in the shadows of darkness that the black cloak and the shoulders are covered with gold lions and holy crosses.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting for the Holy Cross is actually the paladin of the church! A few years ago, a dozen paladins broke into Nigan to attack the blood of countless underground races, intertwined with the sorrowful sorrows of the dying. In the cave of the underground, I put on a defensive stance and began to sing the curse because of the shortness of fear and tension. The mantra I repeated three times to succeed, but the paladin seems to see something incomparable. There is no opportunity to attack. It may be the potential of life and death. A fireball far more powerful than usual, with my handprints whistling out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful slap in the middle of the fireball without the dodge of the Cavaliers chest but the expected explosion and screams did not occur when the fireball approached the armor without a shadow No trace is like getting into the water. I am startling with horror. The second spell, the knight, also appeared in front of me because of my attack. I didn’t even have time to express his amazement at his speed. The bending down magic that has suffered a heavy blow has been interrupted. I am finished...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold my mouth and press me on the cold stone wall while a flash The sharp dagger of the element shines on my neck. "Do not shout if you don't want to die." His voice is not gloomy. It can be said that the soft face is not awkward. It can even be said that the handsome but threatening meaning has not reduced me. I know that now I’m pale and my heart’s fear is unstoppable. The trembling has never been so close to death... I’m probably seeing that I’m afraid, he seems to have relaxed some daggers and left a little. A few points on the neck. "Is there your companion nearby?" I shook my head gently. He was obviously relieved. The hand removed the dagger from my mouth and took it back. I still took my button on the stone wall. Othello cooperates or dies. You don’t want to incite me to kill you as much as killing a chicken.” When I watched his demonstration, I could feel the heat from his body and the smell of the fragrance was blown by the wind. The loose blonde even slipped over my face and I saw his high-eyed eyes dominate everything.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I swear I hate that look, he reminds me of the high position The ridicule of the sacrifices, the scorn of the other nobles, the scorn of the despicable men, under the double oppression of fear and shame, I seem to hear the nerves of the syllabary, so I began to scream and tear his chest, kicking his calf completely. Possible deaths<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My courageous rebellion is definitely beyond his expectation. He obviously panicked and wanted to recapture my mouth and bite me. Lived, he frowned, and immediately Pressed up and put my hands on my head and put my knees against my legs. My horrified yelling has not yet produced a result. He vacated his hands and tightened it so close that I could hear his heart beating through the armor. The sound is definitely a shame. The shame is unprecedented. A man is tightly stuck. He can’t resist. He can only squabble. He is struggling like a caterpillar. The body begins to violently tremble. The tears are once again bursting into the dyke. Opening my mouth and seeing me look like I was staring at Medusa. I haven’t moved for a long time. It seems that he finally reacted. What is the current posture? It’s like watching the dragon beast jumps backwards and then stepping on the broken The balance on the stone almost fell and fell. "Oh... that... you go." His face seemed to be red and he hurriedly ran towards me. He only left tears and still worried.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know what mentality I used to track the paladin’s probably waiting for revenge. After calming down, I sorted out the messed robes and dried my eyes. Tears went to the direction of the knight and went up. This guy didn’t get lost in such an environment. I was still hopeful that he accidentally stepped into the nest of the giant rock poison iguana. He occasionally took out a map against the room or the armpit. Checking the traces on the ground gradually approaching Othello, he must have premeditated something and the traces of my departure from Othello became his guide. I suddenly had a feeling of being fooled. The shouting and wailing sounds in the distance are getting clearer and clearer. We are already arriving. The battlefield is <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I am you, leave it as far as possible, the better." He suddenly said to himself that my tracking was discovered from the very beginning. "I want to watch you being cut into pieces" "I hope I can let you down." "Do you think you can fight against the whole of Nigan? The most elite troops in the underground world are in front." "It’s just like the plan." "I suddenly feel cold. He is definitely not like a fool. It is not like a person who will go to death. When I am contradicting and hesitating, he pulled out a reel and rushed out like the battlefield outside.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;The explosion shouted a horrified shout with a tauren’s accent. "Stop him to stop him." The sound of countless wings flapping should be the eagle. I shook my head and he died. The feeling of loss "Don't let him use that scroll is the paradise of the light system, the purgatory paradise" or the voice of the tauren. I just doubt my ears and I don't hesitate to start running. If the paladin is Nigel The condensation of hatred, the paradise of purgatory is the dream of the world. I don’t think he has the kind of reel. But the outside person should not give him the opportunity to unroll the scroll. Now he still doesn’t feel the big magical fluctuations. He must be stopped... although it surprised me. But he can't escape the fate of death after all.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to buy a story written in a book written by a human being from the Grey Dwarf's grocery store. It doesn't make much sense, but there are many interesting things in the human world. It says that human girls don't need to suffer cruel sacrifice training. There is a trepidation between conspiracy and death. It is said that human males will not bow to their knees and pray for women's favor. They will use their heartfelt feelings to warm and protect their partners. Some people who call them knights are the banner of loyalty and honor. The humility and compassionate messenger is the brave and sacrificed warrior. It is the embodiment of justice and spirituality. They have all the virtues of the world. They scatter the light to every corner of the world. I used the contents of this book to ask the mentor to be smashed. A companion I once asked about human beings in exchange for a more intense ridicule. "Where did you see these yy books, the idiot valley dwarves opened the 'starting point' grocery store?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I think of these things clearly, even the content and title of the book I forgot, is it because of loss? Too many reasons, I silently watched the back of the 'murderer' gradually moving away from me. "Are you with the male paladin?" I don't know why I want to do my best, shouting like a coughing mouth. The blood foam I know that the action just let the bones penetrate deeper into the lungs. The two figures stopped and came back to me. "What do you mean when you just said something, don't play tricks." The knight looked at me with an alert look... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean that there was a Knights of the Temple who went through the battlefield of Othello and also took the magic scroll of Purgatory Heaven?" The knight still uses Suspected eyes look at me<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister Talis I see that she is not lying..." The little wizard is excusing me<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The drow is a sinister guy, you are too kind." Obviously the knight still doesn't believe me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That’s already ten minutes ago. If you continue to delay, I don’t guarantee You can also see the complete body of the guy. I am amazed at the treatment magic of the female knight. Although the internal broken bones are not demobilized, the bleeding has stopped. But I should be able to walk barely now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After I told them the direction they seemed to want to leave as soon as possible. I know that my best choice now is to hide in the dark maze and find a quiet place to raise. It’s a good injury...but it seems that when I met the first human knight, I couldn’t control my body with the nerves of the palm of my hand. “I will take you there.” All three of us are surprised at this sentence<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sun on the ground is very warm?" I walked in front of the abruptly asked two human females to follow me a meter or so behind me if there was any change in the female knight. I cut down on me for a while and they didn't answer my question but I can feel them surprised at my problem. I took them to an exit above the battlefield where I can overlook the entire Othelloping. The cave where the male knight entered the battlefield has collapsed because of the battle. Countless lives on the battlefield have struggling to kill the flag of Cuihana’s mother has fallen, but many other city’s reinforcements are crowded on this small plain. In a fierce place, I found the figure of the male paladin. A magical long sword waved the impenetrable eagle banshee up and down. Apparently he didn't have the chance to use the magic scroll. I looked at his jumping blond hair and didn't know why. I have never seen the sun in the warm sunshine. I only saw the radiance and warmth of the sun in the book. The knight and the mage are next to the sun.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know where to take out a lot of reels and then started a gorgeous showdown with the magician below. I always looked at the male knight's hair in a silly manner, but there was no real sense of realism and no fight. I didn't pay attention to my body. I didn’t have any enlightenment in the battlefield. Finally, the two knights got rid of the entanglement of the Tauren’s sacrifice and took advantage of the rising elements. “Sylvia’s adults are now Use that scroll.” The knight said faintly that he was called Sylvia. He unrolled the reel and then it was a pure and dazzling fire. The snow was more than a white, whiter flame than any white, and the pure white flame After a large river collapsed from the sky and landed on the ground, it spread and flowed away to drown everything that passed through. The Tauren eagle enchantress evil eye dwarf Medusa is no matter what is alive or the body is escaping. The one that was half dead on the ground was caught in the flames of the flames that fell down like the Tianhe River. It was immediately submerged in it...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The two knights floated on the element of the air. At this time, Sylvia saw that I was obviously very surprised. "It was her who brought us." The knight explained that Sylvia was even more surprised that he ignored the female knight. My eyes stretched out to me on the element of qi. "The power of Purgatory Heaven will soon spread here. Please grab my hand and I will take you out of here." I still look at his shiny hair. I looked at it and continued to swallow the white light of life. "Is this the color of the sun?" "I said to myself, "Will you take me to the ground, let me see the warm sunshine, protect me like a knight, love me?" "His hands are solidified in the air and the eyes are more complicated. I also got the inevitable answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
