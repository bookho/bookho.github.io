			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves quickly did what the Knights of Tamik said. Without the elders, they have already had six gods. The performance of the Tamik Knights also let them know that they have no chance. In particular, the only elf, Kailin, who can pull the phantom bow, has already been caught. Elder Lloyd should be discussing the issue of the whispering sorrow at this time, and the elders of Luya went to the Tower of the Tooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reason for the elves to change. The reason for the Tamik Knights seems not too much, but the elves are retreating from here. Outside and outside, no closeness is allowed. The Tamik Knight even vowed that he would never harm these elder elders as long as the elves kept the blank space inside. For the elves, this vow is undoubtedly the only way out and hope, and they have to believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for the help of the Tamik Knight is very simple. The goal is only the leaves of the world tree, not the elves here. The leaves of the world tree and the whereabouts of the two people are easily asked from the mouths of the elves, which is undoubtedly a perfect opportunity. No matter what method is used, the key is to free up enough space here to make people feel uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some unexpected gains from the elder elders to find a few transfer scrolls to the European Fu, these are undoubtedly convenient for the elves to ask for help, but unfortunately There is no chance to come and use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After excluding all possible obstacles, the Templar immediately placed a trap, waiting for two people who might return from the magic circle at any time. But when the Tamek Knight continued to slaughter the remaining genius elf prisoners and used the blood of the elves to cover up the magic traps underneath, Talis stood up to stop him. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual time when the Tamek Knight hijacked enough captives, using his own unique and effective method to threaten the elves, the horsewoman is already somewhat uncomfortable. Got it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t kill anyone, she just didn’t see such killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, murder will eventually bring some murderous emotions, high-ranking saga, cold and sharp killings, boiling hatred and even madness. After murder, there will be varying degrees of ups and downs, or satisfaction or pleasure or disgusting or fear or boredom. Only the Tamik Knights kill and kill no joy, no sadness, no worries, and even the most subtle murderousness, like a multi-year housewife doing housework, the kind of eyes and sophisticated action. Such people and such murders are more chilling than any brutality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that this path does not match the identity of the 'Knight', especially the Knights of the Temple of Celest. Even the one that met in Elazia was like a beast. It seems that the bloody degree and ruthlessness of the killings do not know the immediate knight of the pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tamik. Do you have to do this? Just to cover up the traps and let them distract, you need to kill hundreds of innocent Elf?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must be." The Tamik Knight replied faintly. He didn't even look at Talis, but he cut open the throat of an elf. The hot blood rushed out of the elf's throat, and a ray of hot air emerged in the cold air of the dawn. The light of the fireflies in the air flashed the original red blood. The elf's hands and feet made a convulsion, which was the reaction of all the animals' necks after being cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, can't do this." Talis snorted. Standing in front of the Tamik Knight. "What is the difference between those who look at the people who are arrogant and killing? Although these elves are heretics, they are not evil..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tower The sight of the Mick Knight allowed Talis to subconsciously shut up. He looked at Talis up and down like an object, and then asked: "This is the mission of the Pope, you have to get in the way"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just said this It’s not appropriate...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Warning, don’t get in the way.” The Tamik Knight faintly dropped a sentence and turned his head and continued to grab one person. Elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. Not like this, we want other ways." Talis took him to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamik Knight looked at Talis, and suddenly looked up and looked at the sky, the face of the wooden face showed a thoughtful expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since following the man who came here from Wang Du, and inexplicably joined the ranks of the Knights of Tamik, she has always been in a very fascinating situation<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;茫The mood is blurred. I don't know what I should do or my position. Until now. She seems to feel that she has finally grasped some beliefs that she can persist, so she feels she must insist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she intuitively felt something wrong with the Tamik Knight, she immediately told herself that she must insist,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she went up to stop the Tamik Knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamik Knight is looking up and thinking, his face is full of expressions, but he can only see that this should be a purely rational thinking to calculate a mathematical problem. Soon he re-buried his head again, as if he had figured it out, and then the black knife light shone like a lightning bolt. ‘呛’, Talis’s figure flew back with a bloody light. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 踉跄 踉跄 , , 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔 塔The gray knight's face is still the kind of expressionless <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mu, no emotional fluctuations and murderousness, this is just the conclusion that he is completing that rational thinking. The action only. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will die if I get in the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamik Knight is now cutting, Tali The line barely held the long sword on the hand and retreated. If it wasn't for years of training, her instinct was instinctive.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword was against the dodge, and the first knife of the Knights of Tamik had already let their heads fly out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relative to the knife on the shoulder and the curse of the injury, the shock that Talis felt in her heart was even more unparalleled, she did not think of it. It is only for such a simple reason that the Knight of the same place, and the direct knight of the Pope, will gather himself to kill. She has completely stayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis does not understand, but the Tamik Knight is very clear. His judgment is very simple. He can see that most of Lancelot's apprentices are inconvenient. Being unable to become a booster in their own imagination will become a resistance, so they need to be removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, suddenly a person came over, and the Tamik Knight’s eyes swept to see the kid named Abbie who had just joined in the forest. When the incomprehensible kid was encountered in the forest, the Tamik Knight was originally a knife. But Talis, who was just about to start and explained clearly with the two Templars, just came and recognized him. Talis explained that this young man is her friend. This kid also stated that he only caught a winged Pegasus but could not control it. He was inexplicably involved in this battle. After some explanations and inquiries, Talis asked Abin to join their team. The Tamik Knight also agreed that the weak body and white magic seemed to be the starting point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now it seems that the effect of this is not going to start. Only kill together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the Tamik Knights prepared for the knife to cut the kid named Abin into two paragraphs, he saw him take a sword and stab In the hands of <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really stabbed in Talis’s hand, his sword is heavy and deep, almost piercing the horse’s arm and piercing her Ribs. Then he<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turned her on one foot and held her up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing? Are you crazy?" Talis was awakened from the horror of the Tamika Knights at this time, but immediately Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the greater anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abin did not answer her, just looked at the Tamik Knight and asked: "Tamik. The Talis Knight does not need to kill her, though it is in the way. Just tie her up and throw it on the side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? You are not her friend?" The Tamik Knight looked at him faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
