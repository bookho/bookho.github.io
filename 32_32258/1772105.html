			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa finally resisted not using the transfer reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Ved Nina’s promise is really tempting, he is very curious about this classmate because he understands that she used to be human identity and no longer has it. He was very wary but he still didn't go to Deya Valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is that the simple scroll is there and will not expire, but as long as he really goes to the whistle valley, he may not come again. No matter where it is, as Videnina said, paradise must be cautious even before it is a true paradise. Someone once said: Although it is probably a good place, but it will not come back when you go, so it may be better to go as late as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Descartes is definitely not a true paradise, but it would be impossible to re-live a normal person’s life once you have gone. What's more, after all, it is the Necronomics Society of Vid Nina that is so good to hear, but the sinister reputation of hundreds of years is enough for the most daring people to consider again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I know that I have this post. The things that Bishop Rhones arranged for him don’t seem so annoying. I know that I can get away from it at any time. The environment can be faced with a relaxed attitude. Maybe it’s good to go to Deya Valley and the priesthood here tomorrow and the Bishop of Ronis and the School of Magic and the king’s farewell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the arrangement of Bishop Ronis, I will go out and go to Airy in a few days. Asa feels a little funny. The bishop is like a veteran politician who knows how to plant a blame for political capital. The two people he appointed to arrest the murderer are in some ways the real murderer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, how these specific things work does not require him to worry that Bishop Ronis should have confessed everything to Rod Hart. It seems that it is just like the restaurant that waits for the cooking to be made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa in the big house is lazily rushing to pick up things. Sandro also lazily fiddled with several heads on the stone platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said what are you going to do now?" Sandro suddenly spoke. "Is it here or is it to listen to Deya?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa is very surprised. The old man rarely took the initiative to say that he was more serious. Looking at Sandru's look, the movement is slow and the wood is still still half dead and dead like death or death. It’s just like a casual reminder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed and replied: "I don't know what to do..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He was really confused during this time. He is not an indecisive person, but after all, he is not an easy choice to eat or not eat a loaf of bread. Although I always feel depressed and hateful, it is, after all, the bishop’s note that many of the hopes are said to be related to the major plan of peace and security. And the only other option is not an easy task. According to Bishop Ronis, it is also related to the safety of the Big 6. Even if he has no sense of responsibility in his mind and then has no intention of facing such a major choice, it is not that he can shut down my bird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shandro sighed and shook his head and said, "You are such a sissy stinky boy, Ronis would think of what you want to do as a hero. The brain is also getting into the water..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa shrugged and said: "In fact, I never thought about what to do as a hero. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shandro shook his head and shouted. "You still have a little vision. This is the world's first chore. Risks and stress, and the working hours are still irregular and tired. It seems that the spirit is very glorious but the shit is not the most annoying job in the world. Doing this line is not just a matter of agility, but also a sense of courage and determination. It’s just to look at you. Now, for this bird thing, it’s hard to be like this. You know you can’t do it.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly someone knocked the big wooden door to the ping pong and a female voice shouted: "Is there anyone in it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa heard who was this voice. But he is very surprised how she actually found it here? He walked over to the door and said to Sandru: "I am looking for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, Sandro said with a sigh of relief: "Hear a woman The voice thinks that you are looking for you, you know that you are looking for you, not looking for me?" He walked over and opened the wooden door and sneaked out to use a very gentle voice to ask: "Is it looking for me?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa walked over the door and saw that the door was really a niece. He frowned and asked: "How can I find it here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I don’t like to sway him, this priest is also a current red man but it is only limited to the Magic Academy and The high-ranking officials of the imperial court do not need to say that this kind of squad is not an ordinary official. He would not tell his true identity and never told her to live in this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cut how I don't know." I still dress up with a smug look. "I last saw you seeing you go here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Asa frowned still wondering. Even a senior thief who wants to follow him is not a relaxed thing, let alone her. "What are you doing for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady's eyes sighed and said, "I can't find you? Anyway, there is something for you, come out, wow!" She suddenly saw the scene inside the wooden door and jumped up. "This....what is this place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra is making a face and saying: "He is a small worker who helped me move my body. Here is the king. All the dead people in the morgue are under my control. You will also be in charge of me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young lady’s face smacked her hand and smacked her bare chest. "It’s really scaring me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell are you looking for? Do you want to go in and sit down and talk?" Asa asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get out of the way, I have something important to let you go with me." I didn't bother to take the Asa out. go with. Sandro shouted at the back: "Don't worry, if you die in the wind, I will help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't care what to do anyway It’s okay to go with me.” Miss niece dragged him away with Asa’s hand. The big house was close to the city, and soon they both went outside the city of Wangdu and gradually became farther and farther. Going outside a dense grove, I went straight into Asara. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very quiet in the woods. Asa is completely unclear about what happened. Suddenly the arm touched the sly chest and saw her pink face suddenly thinking: I don’t want to come here and do it with her. I quickly said to her: "I tell you that now I am not doing this kind of thing. I still have to say that a strange feeling in my heart has suddenly come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the feeling of ice water pouring from each pore into the body. This is an instinct for danger and murder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s spirit slammed tightly. But his body is soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost just in the next moment when I felt dangerous, another, more real and strange feeling began to spread in his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His feet suddenly become very heavy, not only heavy, but also numbness and weakness. Once this weakness is reached, the muscles are quickly spread in the body with the wildfire. The ground is one piece after another. The foot was so soft that it couldn’t support the weight of the body to bend down. Then the weak feeling quickly rose to the chest and the lungs of the lungs lost their strength. The heart seemed to be too lazy to move the head. It felt like a big, heavy neck and fast support. Can't help him feel dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It feels like the speed of the body is transmitted from the foot. When he has this feeling, he just blinked, but when the eyelids are just closed, the whole body is They are all soft and have no strength to even open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a double curse of weakness and dullness. In the High School of Magic, there are no more than five people who can release such fast and amazing curse spells. Even a curse like a horse can erode the strength of standing in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at this time, the ignorant cockroach pulled his arm and pulled him into the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too big. It was as simple as an idiot that fell into a deadly trap. He did not have any hostility to him and he did not threaten him at all, so he did not have any warning to her but forgot that she might be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head is already faint, but Asa still heard the sound of five swords tearing the air at the same time. Even if his body is weak and sour, his spirit is all hard and angular under the crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angles and timing of the five swords are impeccable. What's more, he is still soft and dizzy, and there is still a person holding his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa picked up his arm and threw out the ignorant cockroaches with all the remaining power. She just flew out of the gap of Jianguang. But it was only this delay that Asa himself had no chance to dodge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five orientations are seamless. The timing of the five swordsmen's shots and even the slight trembling on the wrists echoed each other, but the five swords actually combined into a net. Whether he is moving forward and retreating to the left and hiding right, this sword net will blink on him and let him have ten more holes. And he has no power to dodge now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loud bang of Aso was thrown by the wave of his own fireball. The five swordsmen below the sky were also exploding. This is the way he can't remember when he was in the millennium. Weakness and dullness can only affect his ** can not be the release of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was able to feel the muscles on my back almost stunned by a rib and broke my throat and a sweet blood spit out. The power used by this fireball is not very powerful. It can still condense Asa's hand immediately. It is the first to dispel the spell and then the healing spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The injury improved and the weakness was dispelled. In the air, he saw the ambush circle that was prepared for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not only a dozen people, 11 swordsmen and a magician with a long sword. But Asa felt a sense of crisis that was almost desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of these twelve people standing very accurately can be surrounded by the most efficient way to get the most efficient offensive. . And it is absolutely first-class to be able to completely conceal your own breath even if this premeditated ambush can be murderous at the time of the shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost as soon as Asa began to fall, the three most recent swordsmen had already flew in the direction of his fall. They were not shocked by the unexpected escape and explosion. The most effective attack was taken in the first time without any hesitation and slow decision. This is a master style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s first sharp sword, which was first arrived in the air, has already touched the clothes on his body. He grabbed the sword and grasped the sword. Twist the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of starting is not enough. The swordsman has abandoned the sword when he took the sword. Holding the hilt is absolutely necessary, but let the hand holding the blade of the hand let go. When Asa took the sword and the strength of the arm was already weak, he regained the hilt and slammed the shot forward and then shot again. This is definitely a true master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the arm writhing has been done in the hands of the sword is trying to break through the hands of the master to continue to advance. Asa slammed the sword in his palm and smashed the sword. The broken sword continued to stab his face and the other two swords had already smashed. Asa's feet and a handful of broken swords in the palm of his hand were thrown at the faces of the two swordsmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump. The cockroach that was thrown out by Asa fell to the ground and fell into a faintness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two swordsmen who were flying against the face of the sword did not dodge or even bow their eyes. The two long swords still stabbed forward. They know that Asa, who just landed, is the easiest time to evade it, so he will use this method to get a sigh of relief. What these actions express is the most important factor in team operations – taking advantage of any opportunity. This is not just a master or a real warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two long swords stabbed into Asa’s body in disappointment. This is a very fast and extremely stable two-sword Asa can only try to turn the body when the sword front enters the body to take the sword front away from the deadly key. But the two swords left two long, deep blood marks on him and they immediately poured out. The clothes are wet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsman who succeeded in hitting the target fell straight down and shattered the sword directly across his eyes and rushed into his brain and almost broke open from behind. come out. Asa’s throwing is not just a simple delay to scare people. The other face was already covered with pieces of shredded sword. The deep visible bone almost cut his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This broken face still has only a complete firm and cold expression as if it were nothing but Pione’s flesh and bones. Only. The eyes above only stare at all the spirits in Asa's body, and only how to control the weapon can not continue to leave more effective traces on this body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsman who has just passed the sword from Asa’s body has been cut out – the blood-stained splash is deep visible bone. But the swordsman stunned because it was the body of his companion. Asa finally grasped the arm that held the broken sword and crushed his wrist bone. He also pulled the swordsman over to block this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is worthwhile to seize one of these masters and the cost of these two not-so-two swords. Pulling the other's body to make weapons and shields is a very effective tactic that Asa has summed up in a few-to-many situation. Such a huge shield is very occluded and it is a huge blow to seeing the companion's flesh and blood flying under his own attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsman who cut the companion was only slightly stunned and immediately lifted the sword and chopped it down. Asa continued to pull the swordsman who fell into his grasp to resist this. A sword. He is an absolute advantage in terms of physical strength and feelings, so he can use the enemy to pull the ground and use it as a shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click. Jianfeng ruthlessly cut into the muscles and cut off the bones and cut the arm that fell into Asa's grasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsman’s sword cleanly cut off his companion’s hand and pulled him over. He can see the consequences of this companion if he continues to be in Asa’s hands. When he made a decision, he did not hesitate to slash his companion's arm like a piece of wood and saved his life. At the same time, Asa's attempt was completely defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arm of the broken arm has long been distorted but did not slam on his broken arm and ran to the magician's position to heal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa held the broken hand in his hand and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of everyone here is enough to be among the top players. The key to swordsmanship is that mind and fighting spirit and judgment ability are absolutely impeccable. Such opponents are very tricky even if they are singled out, and their cooperation with each other is just right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After condensing magic power to use a healing technique, the strong sense of weakness immediately swept in the body and this magic had to be replaced by dispelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of dispelling after the body still feels a little weak. This is the real weakness. The wounds caused by the two swords are very deep and blood has been kept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magician still maintains a relatively safe distance from Asa and is not in a hurry to use any offensive spells. The distance and the trees make it unlikely to hit any direct attack and the sorcerer is more at risk of damaging the companion, so he always uses the immense weakness and dullness. This is enough for Asa to have to use all the chances of casting to dispel the weakness of no matter who is in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is only the least time he encountered an enemy in an ambush, it was also the most dangerous one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five swordsmen who shot the first time while he was dispelling, and the other three others have already circled Asa in a circle. intermediate. Everyone can see that this opponent is by no means free to attack alone and must be able to deal with the most effective attack method. The position of the swordsmen stood nine people and started to shoot at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is undoubtedly a meticulous study of the collective attacks that have been tempered through thousands of battles. The nine swords are each in politics and echo each other into a huge The sword net was overwhelmed by him. At the same time, the debilitating technique of dying has turned over again and again in his body to spread his tight muscles and softly smash it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed the most dangerous one and more likely the last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa violently gathered all the spiritual powers through meditation to a point and then burst out like crazy. The turbulent waves of strength and will in the body immediately squeezed out the weak spells out of his throat and screamed at the sword net that was not like a human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa can even feel how the surrounding air is torn apart on the sword front. The feeling of meditation has already reached its peak, but even then he can't detect where there is a gap around him that will allow him to cross the past. It’s just nine iron bars that aren’t big, but they’ve filled all the space in the area of ​​more than a dozen steps. It’s obvious that you can’t see the sword and the sword. Every angle in every direction and every route he can jump is dead. The pace of these nine swordsmen, the body movements and breathing, all reflect a subtle common rhythm. No matter how he evades in the center, the nine swords will echo each other like the rehearsal dance movements. The order is clear and efficient. There are interceptions and restraints. There are straight thorns and cross slashes. He can't completely avoid them. As long as any sword shape has any stagnation, other swords will immediately follow until they turn him into a pile of diced meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can't hide, you can't hide without a way to make a living. He has always been pressured. The stronger the crisis, the more motivated. The more murderous the danger and the tension is the catalyst to release all the animal and vitality in the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of his impact, the swordsman immediately retreated. Although the man retreats, the sword is weaker but stronger. The two swordsmen around him are also retreating and are plunging in the middle while retreating. All three of the swords and swords have been concentrated in front of him. He has formed a whirlpool of swords in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swords of the three senior swordsmen have merged and resonated. Even a group of steel rushed into it and only turned into iron filings. Then the three stopped and they waited for the sword net to gather behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Asa’s momentum has not been reduced, and his thoughts of retreating in his heart have never been faced, and this will immediately be pressed to smash him. His fighting spirit is already a sharp red-hot spike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't use magic. He can't use magic now. This fighting spirit and vitality and fighting ** in the body angered the impact of the magical power into a part of this power. This wild, primitive power disdains any skill and ignores efficiency. He waved the most direct weapon - his fist, he would use his flesh and blood to open his own life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Facing such direct honesty ** naked ground pure attack all the changes are already pale and useless three long swords from the same direction in three directions The same strength of the same vibration spurs Asa’s fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a hard touch. All of Asa’s vindictive powers are hard-hitting with the swordsmen’s swordsmanship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three long swords began to smash at the same time as the fists touched, and only a crisp sound came out neatly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the path of Jianqi, the tip of the sword pierced the vindictiveness on the fist. The skin touched by the three sword tips immediately burst into the sound of the broken phalanx. And the sound of the sword shattered at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swords, spurs, spurs, impacts, anti-seismic forces, entangled, all released their respective weapons in the situation of evenly matched, can not support. The three swordsmen's tiger's mouth ruptured and the bare hilt could not be dropped on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fist epithelial flesh skeletal fragmentation. Asa screamed, though it looked like it was still in the shape of a hand, but it felt as if it had been raged like a rag that had been trampled by cattle and horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of his sprint has been exhausted in this hard touch and the body has stopped and the six swords behind have almost touched his clothes. But now this is only six swords. The sword net that has just been in the sky has already collapsed at the same time as the three swordsmen defeated. The sword net behind him lost its forward movement and returned to six solitary swords. When the three most recent swords were stabbed into the flesh of the back, Asa finally re-aggregated the strength and began to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residual power is no longer enough to cope with six swordsmen who are less than enough to face a similar sword net but still enough to escape. Although the blood has soaked the clothes on his body, he still has an absolute advantage in physical strength. The residual vindictiveness in the body can still temporarily resist the curse of weakness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa jumped over the front of the three swordsmen and flew outside the woods. Just let him escape into the king and should be fine. After all, he is an up-and-coming sect, no one can pursue him in the public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of strange breaks sounded behind and there was no sharp end face to open the air whistling but a blunt broken sound. And this voice is not too thick, but the quality is not too high. It seems that it is hit and there is no lethality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things behind Asa’s leaping from the feet. This is a hockey ball that is bigger than the head and is rolling forward. Asa’s magical force in the ice hockey is also clear. He raised his hand in the air and bent his legs and hands to protect his head and face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice hockey blasts without the fireball. The mighty explosion is not the blast, but the substantial ice fragments are all collision and penetration. A powerful voice. The trees in a small area are all played sparsely and shattered. The penetration of these ices with magical power is comparable to that of arrows. Many branches with thick arms fell and some thinner trees were also pierced by ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'Ice Blast' of this water system is not a small spell. As long as the level of the magician has not reached the level of supernaturalism of Bishop Ronis or Cedrus, you must adjust the magical power to breathe a few breaths before you can cast spells. And this wide-ranging killing spell should also delay the footsteps of several swordsmen behind him, so Asa, who fell heavily on the ground, immediately bounced and he must continue to run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the tingling of the right leg and the left shoulder immediately poked the strength of the running he had just gathered up. Two long swords punctured from his thighs and shoulders. The past. Then four hands and two other long swords immediately poured into his body. Asa couldn’t move anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left and right icy swordsman has broken open the skin and stopped at the neck of the artery as soon as it is slightly pressed Will shoot out like a fountain. The four hands were very powerful and accurate, and they pinched the important parts of his hands and feet. This is definitely a practice of practice and practice. The sword on the shoulders and thighs passed through the muscles, so even if he had other fighting spirits, he was only grayed out and pressed by the swordsmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's all too fast. From the beginning of his ambush and then evade the counterattack and escape to the end of his time being a total of only a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Asa knows that he is not counting on the few swordsmen who hold him. In the face of the ‘Ice Blast’, they did not evade the concession. They only slightly blocked the bottom of the eye. If the leather armor of the body had sufficient defensive power, they should all fall down. Asa had to admit that even if he was more savvy, he couldn’t help but face the opponents who were able to cooperate with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weakness after the disengagement makes every wound on the body become more and more painful. The two long swords that continue to flow through the shoulders and thighs almost He was nailed to the ground. One of them seemed to pass through the bones. He felt so painful that even his own bone marrow was squatting down the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing? Do you know that I am a sect of the Magic Academy? What do you mean by doing this? Do you want to rebel?" Even Asa felt his own These words are both boring and old-fashioned, but they are still weak, but now they only hope for the effect of this kind of official. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several swordsmen did not respond to his words, and the expression on his face did not fluctuate. The swordsman still intimately held the blood vessels on his neck. The powerful hand still firmly plays a role in his joints and several key points. The magician and the broken-armed swordsman in the distance also slowly came over but did not speak. This group of people seems to be just a machine of battle and action that has nothing to do with things other than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But a person farther away suddenly jumped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person has been watching carefully in the distance, ready to escape at any time, even when Asa was pressed down, he still dared not come out until now. Asa’s voice really learned that he was completely safe and completely victorious, and then jumped out from behind the trees. Very elated emotions made his voice sound like singing: "How? This time I finally got caught. Finally I won. Finally, let this guy eat it. I have already said that I dare to be against me. You are looking for death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, you guy. I knew I should have slaughtered you." Asa looked at the smug prime minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh." The cockroach that was thrown out by Asa and stunned, and finally stood up, but the bloody situation immediately scared her. She stumbled son ran in front of the prime minister shaking asked: "Did not you say just to find a few people to beat him up in a mess like this it how??" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, the nobleman found her and said that she had a good business to help her.
