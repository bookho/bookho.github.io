			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue transmission light disappeared because Hamm appeared in the transmission magic array of the Deya Valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first glance, he can hardly believe his eyes, and in the past, such as the world of fairyland, the whistle valley of the paradise is now a ridiculous. The grassland of the grass has become the silt in the mulch of the mulch. The mulch leaves are flourishing. The tall trees are all left with a weary dead wood. The plants and plants cultivated by the dead spirits have been cultivated for hundreds of years. All of the scenery has already died like this. Only a few buildings are standing alone in the sky. It is clear that there is no cloud in the sky, but how the sun can't shine down the valley is like a dead field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singular humming sounds over the flute valleys throughout the shadow mountain. Spreading with this sound is an incomparably powerful atmosphere. This breath will wipe out all the vitality in the flute valley and the sun will not pass through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This breath is actually no stranger to Hamm to Deva Valley. This is the breath of the ancient artifact dark star standing on the top of the shadow. . It’s just that the atmosphere is not as calm as it used to be, and it’s as violent as a tsunami. The Descartes Valley is the only corner of the Shadow Mountain Range that was chosen by Akibad himself. The chaos of this breath has now been drowned out with this only dead corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think you dare to come." A figure walked away from the distance silently in this inanimate place like a wandering soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter with Nice?" Inham asked with amazement. The voices of the two Necromancers are as relentless as the humming sounds in this empty valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you not going to be more clear?" The necromancer, known as Nice, frowned and looked at him because of his anger. And the killings, but in the end, all turned into a kind of deep helpless sigh. "The Dark Star has been awakened except us. There is no more living in the Descartes Valley. It won't take long for us to be alive..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Necromancer is the only life that can be affected by the breath of the Dark Star. Each Necromancer will accept the brand of the Dark Star when entering the Deva Valley. This branding has already destined their destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who pulled up the Dark Star?" Isn’t the hilt still in the Glorious Castle? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know? "Nice watched as Inham walked around for a while. "You come over, both teachers are at the top." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blackness of the peaks of the Shadow Mountain Range, which is high in the distance, is like a huge snake circling. Inham is following the way. Going there.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two old men on the summit are standing in the choppy black atmosphere. They stare silently at the dark stars above the altar. Nice When Inham was up, they didn't look back and saw that the artifact of the King of the Dead is still inserted on the altar. It is just a thousand times more powerful than in the past.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword itself does not have anyone to pull up but it contains a thousand years of breath but it is pulled up or is about to be pulled up. Under such a close distance, he feels This breath is infinitely unparalleled, but the inside is actually just a behemoth that is about to break through the full string of bows. It will make the more horrible explosions conceal and wait for the explosion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Someone picked up the hilt in the Glorious Castle. "Inham understands. But his surprise is not diminished or even turned into a faint feeling of looming ominousness in his heart." Who? Is it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened? I thought it was the ghost you made. Is it not? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two old men turned back to Shante and Ai Ruiruier. The expression of Shante is still indifferent in this breath like a living fossil Egray Nair is similar to Nice. She looked at the insults of anger and killing in her eyes but she did not burst out. She paused. Q: "Is the transaction between us already finished?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of the Dead has been born and the fate of the Master will be killed and not killed. There is no difference between death and death. In fact, even her now The question asked also has no meaning.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stephen? You were cheated to the Glorious Castle. Now it is already the king of the Necromancer. Is it just a corpse transformed by a corpse? This should be related to what you do, even if it is not intended. "..." The mountain is full of wrinkles like a thousand years old bat fossil face is still indifferent. Although his eyes are as turbid as fossils, it seems that nothing can be overwhelmed by him or he can guess that it seems to him that there is nothing in the world that is worthy of emotional fluctuations. "But now it doesn't matter....There will be this day. Sooner or later..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to go back and see." Mu's face turned and changed, and suddenly he turned and walked down the hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the Glorious Castle? Feeling the breath of the King of the Necromancer at such a close distance Do you think you can still keep your own thinking?" Nice face full It is a sneer. "It doesn't have to be so anxious. When the King of the Dead returns to this Deva Valley and really pulls up the Dark Star, we will all become his loyal servants. By the time you are branded in your body, you are destined for your destiny. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Hamm did not answer his footsteps, he still did not pause and hesitated. Back in the valley, he did not go to take the transfer reel but went to the place where the gargoyle was stored. Even if you can't use the transfer reel, he has to take a gargoyle to see at the closest distance to see what is going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are you going?" A hoarse voice was hard to hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Ham's footsteps suddenly settled and he turned and saw the sorcerer's thin and broken figure. In the face of the infinite scent of the Dark Star, it seems that the seal magic array they set up was not much stronger than the thin paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that everything is your credit? It’s really hard for you. I’ve been working hard for so long, but I’ve been trying to stop it. My people are done. How do you say, should I thank you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to hear as many rusted shovel rubbing each other The ridicule in Nina's voice means that even if you can't understand it, you can feel it. I don't know if it was the effect of the black star that began to release the breath or the mood. The flame in the sorcerer's eye was much more vigorous than usual. She looked up and looked at the dim sun hanging in the middle of the sky and then slammed down and looked at Hamm’s muscles that had been dry for decades. It seemed to be laughing: “I haven’t seen the sun for a long time. I have been imprisoned by you since I was imprisoned. But I didn’t think of it before I saw the sun filtered by the great spirit of the dead. I have some doubts whether you specifically did this to give me a surprise?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light from the distant magical array lights up and then dissipates. Then Sandro’s figure appears and he looks around and walks quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are you coming back to celebrate this great moment?" Vadinina smirked like a bellows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru looked at her and Inham and asked a low voice: "Who did it?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shandro's face is very heavy and very depressed, just like pouring a hundred pounds of lead on his face. And it is still mixed with the most intense gunpowder to explode at any time, especially when he looks at the intent in the eyes of Inham, he has no cover. But because Hamm didn't even look at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Strictly speaking, he is unintentional. The teacher does not have to be too nervous because it is not related to the individual's will. It is fate." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ved Nina puts her hand up. She is now as ugly as a proven prophet. It’s all that is connected with destiny and cannot be resisted. The greatness of the rebuttal. "Lonnis teacher, you and Deken... Then even almost everyone in the Descartes Valley, almost everyone in the world is stopping me from acting. You have all succeeded. Because of Hamm you even have to imprison me. But in the end, the final result was that I won."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru snorted and looked very ugly but did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vide Nina’s interest is getting higher and higher and continues to say: “No, it should be said that I am victorious. This is the gear of fate. Fixed trajectory I stand on the side of destiny. All your efforts are in vain. You can even say that your obstruction is only part of your destiny. I don't hate you because I know it is fate..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
