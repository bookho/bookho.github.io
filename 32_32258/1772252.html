			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, as long as we make it clear, we might find a better way to solve it. Mr. Sander is in all the Imperial Academy of Magic. After all, relying on the help of the Paladins to continue to conceal it does not really benefit our cooperation." Colonel Roland also looked at Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed and swept over the face of Roland’s head, Cedrus. He can't have any disgust with these three people. It's impossible to blame them for their motives and behaviors. From their standpoint, there is no doubt that even if you don't know the truth, you might think so. After all, Sandru really seems to be a strange old man who doesn't know the importance of the world and completely ignores the secular world. It is really not acceptable for anyone to slap the king and the empire's safety and his will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the truth is really impossible to say. Even if they really tell them they can't have any help, whether they don't believe it or not, it's just annoying and dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can rest assured. Although I will not tell you and will not tell you what you mean, but you can replace Sandro to assure you. "Asa slowed down the sound and said a word." "In the future, that thing will never add any trouble to the empire to Oufu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My words can only be said to the point where you are It’s not about risking angering Sand Drew to see a space. You can do it yourself.” Finished the words. Asa only felt a sense of powerlessness and loneliness. He closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedrus and Colonel Roland looked at each other. The look is a bit weird but they don't talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiao Xiao is looking at him more eccentric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The beautiful Miss Vedina is in the meditation room over there." Stephen pointed to a direction in the distance behind him. "It’s hard to be trapped in a top-level seal magic circle with five magic jade as the core. But I know that you must have a way to help her out from the outside. If you want to release her is yours. Freedom, I will never stop you, I promise that no one in this Deya Valley will stop it." His face leaned forward slightly and looked at Sandro with a questioning gesture, smiling gently but clearly Q: "How? Are you going to let her out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru looked at the distance and silenced for a long while and sighed: "Count I want to let her calm down a little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stepne smiled slightly. It seems that these are as early as he expected. He said: "Aiden and the boys are indeed somewhat wrong, but they are not really hands-on. Only four people work together to seal her. The most important thing is that it is really necessary to let the Lich Miss there. Calm down alone. You also know that some of the things she has done are too much... Now I will ask you if you are still acting as the president. Would you just sit back and ignore?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Sandru answered with no expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s rare that your judgment has slowly come back. Do you know? Your original clear and high heart is from more than 20 years. When I met Vedina before, I started to have a flaw and started to mess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s like there is a crack in the dam even when it starts. The small is weak but it will eventually collapse. It was just a heartbeat. But after slowly showing up, you actually resigned from the position of the acting president and took away some real treasures of meditation... even Ai Ruiren was also implicated. Resigned from the agency to leave the flute valley." Stephen took a sigh of tea and sighed. "Don't you still have it? This heart knot will grow bigger and bigger as long as you open your head. Until today, even the basic judgments are covered up by the friends born out of the knot. I thought that he and the teacher of Shante. People are coming to deal with you. Want to work with us in Deya Valley? Are you crazy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru has no expression on his face. Variety. Just the face is getting ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But now, since you are still able to wake up, you are not really messed up at home. There are also a few of the former Deli guilds. It’s chic.” Stephen raised his teacup with a toast. "I congratulate you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru suddenly turned around and looked at Stephen and said, "Do you know? Before I started the guy on my head, the one I wanted to kill the most in the past thirty or forty years was you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
