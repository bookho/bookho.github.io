			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say, what did you see in the woods outside the city two mornings ago?" Clause looked at the woman in front of him like a The lion is as majestic as the prey he has captured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way to leaving Wangdu slowly, he was caught up by a large group of soldiers to catch the toss and fear of the wolf, and she said, "I am everything." I didn’t see anything, I don’t know why you caught me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis has no anger or warning or more to say, he doesn’t even want to confirm that this is Not the person he is looking for. He always felt that this kind of inferior citizen was not worth the cost of his tongue. He reached out and grabbed a bit of her forehead with two fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The virgin lady screamed that she was very cherished, the soft, smooth head was attached to a fleshy scalp and immediately left her and the blood immediately filled the cheeks. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finger was wet with blood. Crowes frowned like a small piece of something in his hand and then grabbed it. She lifted her head to the ground and succinctly and powerfully ordered: "Don't let me delay too much time. Say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;璇 has already said no When the words came out, the blood flowed out of the way and the half of the face was red. She barely stood and licked her head and swallowed tears. When she came out, she mixed into the blood and there was no trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis sighed in disgust. He feels that he hates it. Doesn't he know that God wants to create such a low-ranking person? Does it mean to waste the precious time of such a noble person? He threw the garbage-like woman out of the door. Because the content of the trial is temporarily confidential, he cannot casually approach the witness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis said to the Guards officer who was waiting outside: "Go and call me the interrogator in the cell." He was too lazy to do it himself. For the experts who let the people who don't want to talk speak naturally, they have already shown this weird line to the height of self-believing art. Clauses is very confident in them. He once saw one of the strongest traitors insisted that for two days and one night, only accepting half of the crafts of the artists, they completely collapsed and said everything that can be said. At that time, he was basically unable to see the individual except the parts that controlled the speech. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly a Guardian ran over and said to him: "The Duke of Mulak is looking for you to have something to let you go. He is at first You are waiting for you at the gate of the palace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know it." Clavis hesitated. Going to the palace with the Duke must be a very important thing. Anyway, people have already caught it here slowly. It doesn't matter. He originally wanted the interrogator to work here first, and when he came back, he wanted something that would be like a dish on the table, but he thought about it carefully. What is tortured is definitely not the same. If the interrogator knows something that should not be known and takes it nonsense, it will not be worth the loss or he will be better at the side. So he nodded and decided: "When I come back, I will call the interrogator." He looked at the officer with a murderous look. "Remember, you can't just let people know about this woman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know." Guard officer seems to be trying to speak with his head. With. He is very clear about the temper of Clauses. Although these big men are annoying, they only wait carefully and forcefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the big man left, another big man came again. But this is a young man who is still in a high position but gives a feeling that it is completely different. The face that is always soft is comfortable for anyone who sees it. The Guard Officer hurriedly said: "Sir is good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello." The young chief smiled and returned to the ceremony. "It’s hard work here. I heard that you caught a strange female prisoner. What kind of witness is it? I want to see if she can?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is noble Such a kind smile, such a gentle and courteous speech, makes people feel uncomfortable. Moreover, he can't be considered a 'freehand' person anyway. The officer also nodded his head: "Of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa was called by Dr. Ronis early to ask him about his ambush. He intentionally or unintentionally did not say anything about the prostitute, but vaguely said that he was introduced to the ambush by their strategy and then Sander rushed to kill the ambush. And Sandro, who was stolen from something, also told Asa in advance that he would not tell Bishop Ronis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Rooney seems to be clear about whether this matter will be investigated. It is not very concerned. It is only a faint statement: "No one can see the speculation anyway, but it is only speculation that doubt can only be doubtful."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa remembered that he was letting himself run away and didn't talk. But he remembered a strange thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the School of Magic, he immediately walked to the big house. He wanted to ask Sandro what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After walking at the door of the big house, someone stopped him from behind. He turned to see an extraordinary young officer in the air is coming quickly. Asa took a closer look to recognize that it was actually Rod Hart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he didn’t see him now and he is more mature. The young people’s spirit has become more and more restrained without losing the external brilliance. With his handsome and intimate face, he is a tall and straight Knight costume. It is a figure that is embodied in the concept of ‘boy hero’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, you are really here, I am looking for you to have a very hot thing." Although it has not been seen for a long time, Rod Hart did not waste time greeting The guest set, but walked quickly to him and whispered to him. "The prostitute you let go is caught by Clauvis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s face was pale. First of all, I was amazed that even Rod Hart, who was out of the house, could burst into such thrilling words and then was surprised that he was caught by someone who was most troublesome and probably the most troublesome. Even Rod Hart seems to know that things have been swept away? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no figure around, but Rod Hart’s voice is still very low: “A dozen people of a squad of the Paladin are stunned and killed. The grown-up person is very strange. It seems that there is no such thing as a sound investigation. But the captain of the team, Crowes, let the Wangdu Guards’ emergency dispatched yesterday, and first checked the prostitutes of the entire kingdom and arrested many people to interrogate them. Then sent nearly a hundred cavalry out of the city. I inquired that they were going to hunt down a prostitute and it is said to be a very important person. And this prostitute was caught overnight and was sent back this morning."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt’s face is dignified but does not seem to be flustered and continues to whisper: “I think it’s a bit weird, so when I went to the Guards, I went by the way. I looked at it. The Cavaliers squad leader was in a hurry and was called to the palace by the Duke. I took this opportunity to contact the niece. I asked her about her. She told me everything about that day." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; "Is it all told you?" Asa took a breath. Being able to tell Rodhart can tell others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are relieved that she only told me that I have not told anyone else. Clavis has not had time to interrogate her." The sound of Rod Hart's voice The lower the level, the more and more sinking. "Although I know that you can never have anything to do with the Necromancer, but others don't think so. You shouldn't let her go. This woman is too dangerous for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cut you don't know, but the woman deliberately let go." The door of the big house was suddenly opened. Sandru came out from the inside and looked at Asa. It’s a mocking tone. Although Rod Hart intended to keep the voice down, it was not his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This old gentleman is" Rod Hart looked at Sandro's subconsciously stepping back and could not help but bring a sense of fear. He has heard the embarrassing story and can see that the old man who suddenly emerged is the Necromancer. Although he knows that he should be a companion of Asa, after all, the strange means of killing more than a dozen Paladins in the hands of the martial arts is indeed chilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The old Mr. Sandru who loves to talk nonsense is actually the secret master of the bishop's adult. He was here to save me." Asa panicked Just give Sandruan a no-frills title. "But this master will use the Necromancer spell to be misunderstood. So if his identity is very confidential, it will definitely cause a lot of trouble for the bishop..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;;; Rod Hart looked at Sandro and nodded and then looked back to Asa and said, "If you do, then you should kill her." His voice is very light and the slightest look is very sincere. Just to advise friends to eat a bowl of rice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa only felt that Rod Hart’s eyes were sore that he was hurting. He silently sighed and shook his head and said slowly: "But now it is too late to kill her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Asa was shocked. Although knowing that Rodhart will find a way to help himself, he did not expect that he had already brought the cockroach directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure. No one knows what I did. I just moved the order of the guards and told her how to escape and then made some Everything is natural. The escape of a natural prisoner is nothing but an accident."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt's faint smile looks as easy as it seems. But Asa looked at his heart and mixed feelings. He knows that this is by no means an easy task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt is now the preparatory captain of the Paladin. This time, under the deliberate cultivation of the military, the promotion is fast. Asa, who has never cared much about it, can often hear about it in the side population. And now for his own sake, he actually ran away an important prisoner who was hand-picked by the head of the Paladin. This is no longer a ‘dangerous’ word for him. It’s just a joke about his good future and his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She should have been waiting for me now at the place I gave him. I originally wanted to bring her out and quietly in a secret place. Kill her. But I think since you have let go of her, I should still ask you, so now I let her quietly hide in a hotel to ask for your meaning." Rod Hart The voice is very light and soft, like asking his brother to ask Asa: "Or kill her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nature should put her again Let her be caught by the guards who were arrested by the city. Then, the idiot friend who is loyal to you will burst out.” Shan Delu looked at Asa’s ridiculous eyes and words and stabbed him uncomfortable. "Or you can try to quietly escort her out of the city and go high. Haha, I think you should go directly from this to save some effort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s first sinisterly When he slammed Sandru, he took a long breath and closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, as long as you are caught again, it’s not just Bishop Rodriguez and Rod Hart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to choose. Asa looked hard at Rod Hart and said, "Okay, let's kill her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We also followed. "Shandro suddenly stretched out the shoulders of Asa." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid the attention of Rod Hart, he replaced the costume of the knight and put on the ordinary clothes of the civilians. With Asa and Sandrue came to a relatively remote slum in Wangdu City. There are several broken houses that have been abandoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a broken house, Rod Hart stopped and gesticulated that Asa and Sander went to a broken window and didn’t want to speak and then Go in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are finally here." The anxious voice rang inside. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not being seen? "The voice of Rod Hart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. I ran quietly as you said. I was very careful not to be seen on the road. "In the current tone, I don’t really hear the confusion that people in the escape should have. Instead, the breath of the excitement of the girl like a private lover is actually a bit of a spoiled taste. "I am so happy. . I used to be afraid of being caught by them when I was almost crazy. But when I saw you, I was not afraid of anything at the moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa knows Rhodes Why can Hart ask all the things out of his mouth? In the desperate situation, I saw that I have always admired my favorite idols and said that even the gods will not be more inspiring than this.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, since you are here, you don't have to be afraid." "Rodhardt's voice is calm and gentle, and there is a heroic taste that can give any woman a sense of security.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for saving me." "There is an excitatory snoring in the voice of 璇. It is probably a hero who never thought of saving himself. He is a hero who has been admiring for a long time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes to you The things that told me that everything you saw in the woods that day, have you told me other than me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. Do you forget it? You have already asked me. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since that person has told you not to tell others about these things, why do you tell me when I ask you?" Rodhart's voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because" because hesitated, he didn't know how to express his feelings. "Because you are a hero. I have nothing to fear when I stand in front of me, so I will tell you everything." Her voice is full of trust and intoxication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt’s voice is so gentle as if from this voice he can imagine his hand on the woman’s head like a kitten pat. "Are you sure that you haven't said anything to anyone else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing. Really no, I will never lie to you. "Oh, the voice is very positive." Her voice is completely trembled and hesitant. There is nothing to worry about in front of such a hero who can give a sense of security and warmth. The voice of the niece is actually ashamed of the girl. "Do you know that I have always been"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange voice sounded in the turbidity and suddenly silenced all the words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is very familiar with what this sound is. He used to hear it often and often feel it with his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s all done." Sandro’s voice was as dry as the dead bones, pulling up Asa. "Go and see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the broken house Asa saw the embarrassment of falling softly in the arms of Rodhart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some blood on her forehead wrapped in cloth, but her face was very white and the bandage on her head seemed to be as good as possible. Probably not waiting to retouch my face when I waited here because she was coming to see her idol hero. There were traces of tender expression on her face that were fixed when she was over-excited. I don't know if she was surprised by the sudden behavior of the hero in her heart or because she suddenly saw her back and felt incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;璇's head was twisted all over the back. It looks like a twisted rag doll head and body are connected indiscriminately. Rodhart slowly dropped her body on the floor. His manners are still so calm and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodhardt quickly left and he would go back to help the Wangdu Guards to hunt down the fugitive he had just killed. There are only two people in Asa and Sandru in the broken house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru suddenly said: "This kid is really a lot of things. In fact, according to my original plan, I will wait for things to happen when things are out of control. You killed this woman by yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa turned to look at him. "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I want you to experience your mistakes and then correct them yourself." Sandra's sneer made Asa feel like himself. chill. "Do you think that if you let this woman go, can she really live? I said that under the investigation of the Paladin, I will definitely know that the person who ambushed you has been in contact with her and will naturally try to find her." An ordinary woman can't escape. In any case, she has only one way to die. Your kindness is just a joke. It is worthless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It turns out that you have had such a plan." Asa sighed. "No wonder I heard Bishop Ronis say that those corpses were weird when they were present. I have forgotten the rookie and I have said that you could forget that they left and left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want those people to look at it. They will be nervous before they go all out to catch the woman so quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't you be afraid that the Paladin will find you? Are you afraid of giving trouble to the bishop?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said I am not afraid of trouble I just want you to see that your kindness is not even worth a fart." Sandro’s voice actually had a bit of a bad taste. "So when you do things and judge later, you know how to use your head to think about problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I never thought about what it was worth, but I was willing to do that... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I promise that in the end you will also be willing to kill this woman." Sandro's smile sharpened. "You are too weak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still remember when you first came to Wangdu. At that time I could see the firmness and even cruelty in your eyes. It was a man's eyes. But now you are not even as good as a fart." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not speak and looked at the corpse's body silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, don't waste time here." Shandula took Asa's hand and walked out of the house. After turning around the corner, he snapped a finger at the broken house. When they walked back to the big house, the fire had already ignited half of the block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke and Clavis on the road in the palace are walking outside the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unexpected accident" The duke muttered to himself that the slender eyebrows and eyes were bent and usually just the signature smile Now it has expanded to the point where it has been a little out of control, and even the restraint of his self-control ability makes him look like a businessman's face as if he had made a big business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Instead of doing a big business, I picked up the sky-high price that fell from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning the Duke suddenly received the will of the emperor to ask him to enter the palace immediately. This is a sudden incident for the Duke. His subtle observations have made full judgments on the various political forces in the DPRK. Every variable is not even caught in the chest, but he did not expect that the Emperor’s Majesty would suddenly call him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke never cares about the emperor’s liking and movements. He wants to maintain an upright and upright image and can’t learn to greet other people. What's more, it is just a child who is unpredictable and easy to be influenced by the courtiers. Just grasp the fact that those who are in the fly camp have a political advantage and still need to care about him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is still in the name of this empire, maybe it’s actually a bit of a dominance, so he can’t be sloppy and he immediately recruited his assistant, Krauss, for From time to time, two people are required to enter the palace. The Duke’s heart has already prepared for the Emperor’s Majesty. No matter what opinions blame the award or what other people’s instructions are in doubt about him, he can immediately take appropriate measures to block the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Geffenhardt XVII retired all the attendants and even Clause was embarrassed to say what he meant, the Duke was completely jealous. Living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor’s Majesty said that he intended to marry her daughter, Chris. That is to ask him to be his father-in-law and ask him to become a royal family to give him a huge unparalleled political capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like someone who can really make a lot of money is never going to obsessed with the lottery. The strength of the habitually down-to-earth is sometimes shielding the opportunistic emptiness mentality. There will also be some excellent opportunities to go wrong. Moreover, the Duke likes the sense of accomplishment brought about by his own means of improving his position one by one. He is confident that he can reach his ideal height, so he never really considered this shortcut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when this route suddenly fell in front of him, please let him go up and down, what’s the surprise, the ecstasy, and so on. Qualification to describe the mood at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unidentified young emperor is definitely a great trump card in power struggle. Now this ace is not inviting to fall into his pocket and still does not collide with his own honest and honest image. And what effect does such a royal card have in the hands of such a good player? Imagine a beautiful scene in the future, and even the self-controlling people like the Duke can't conceal their happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But happy to be happy, the Duke is still the Duke. He immediately found a discordant tone from this surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have never been concerned about how the emperor’s preferences and intentions have been busy for some time ago, but even the emperor is interested in Chris. He didn't know that there was no doubt that there was a local omission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How was the recent situation of Rodhart's kid?" asked the Duke as Klauvis expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He went to the field and settled a few pagan rebellions. He seems to have done a good job. The military ministers are very satisfied with his ability. The bishop seems to be preparing him. Go with the guy to Ali and go to settle the pagans there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
