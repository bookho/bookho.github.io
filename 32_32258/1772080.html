			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tula Leone is a forest in the southwest of Big 6. Because of the incomprehensible spirit, the elves settled here more than a hundred years ago. Gradually more and more become the place where the elves live the most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the elves, the whisper of the ethnic origins in the East is a sanctuary that does not eat human fireworks. Here is their own kingdom. Although they have always had the arrogance and highness of their culture, they probably have been contaminated with the worldly fireworks. Many places have also become open. The elves here have also gradually changed their relationship with human beings to replace many of the original routines and prayers with a more realistic lifestyle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A human guest today came with a delivery reel. This is a very rare thing. They are very selective based on the personality and culture of the elves. And the scrolls that can be used to transmit the magical array of Tula, must only be those who the elves can see, and such people are usually very few. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if there are fewer Sedros, it must be one of them. Whether it is the human kingdom or here or the dwarf dungeon, he is always the most popular guest. His in-depth magical skills are the vast knowledge and sagacious innovations that any magician user admire. All the governors are willing to ask him for kindness and broad communication and proper communication. He also makes him very Easy to make friends. He used to travel with the Elf elders here when he was traveling around the Big 6. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge corpse dragon has been walking towards the Forte City with a slow degree and will arrive in about three or four days. He had already thought of a way to deal with this almost invincible behemoth, but only had to have some magical items that only the Sierra Leonies had. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he arrived, he heard that the elders were meeting with the special envoys sent by the whispering forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whispered singer never asks any outside affair and rarely contacts the elf outside. This time it is important to send a special envoy to be born. event. This made him a bit worried. He has not been to the whisper of the slang but also knows from the mouth of the elf that there has always been a contempt for humanity. If this special envoy also imposes this ethos on the elders, then he may only have returned empty-handed this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, when the news of his arrival was notified, the elves actually asked him to go to the conference hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stepping into the conference hall, Cedros first greeted the elder elder friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are just right. We were planning to inform you." An elder elder called Cedros to sit in a silver female The elf said to Cedrus, "This is the special envoy of Luya who was sent from the whispering of the slang." Then he pointed to Cedros and said: "This is a great magic that Mr. Sedros we just talked about. Teachers and scholars have a very good relationship with many human countries and religions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello." Cedrus smiled and nodded to the special envoy. . The special envoy's appearance is also very beautiful in the original spirit of the spirits and elegant spirits. It is inevitable that the ignorance of the old-fashioned imagination from the whispering of the slang is not inconsistent with the innocent naive seven emotions. She did not answer, but looked at Cedros's frowning and showing some disgusting expressions to see that she was really biased or badly impressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case. We are informing all countries and groups that we have with us to help us through one person. We hope that you can also assist us. "The elder elder handed a picture to Cedrus. "This is what our special envoys personally painted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portrait is a human male youth. The elf's hand has always been very delicate and very delicate. It can be seen that the special envoy's impression of this person must be very deep. Although he has not studied painting skills, the appearance of the individual is still on paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros looked at this portrait and frowned and asked, "What did this person do?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the old elf does not have the experience of capturing subtle expressions and then analyzing it. It is a stunt of a human being who is proficient in intrigue in a complex environment. So no elf has any doubts about his expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This human being has stolen some of our very important things from the whispering forest. We have to get it back. So please Mr. Sedros, you must help us. Knowing that your relationship and relationships in human society are very broad, I hope that you can at least clarify the identity of this person and where you are now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His small demands naturally agreed immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to Oufu is already at night. Cedros immediately sent the things he had taken to the blacksmith's workshop in the city. The blacksmith here was secretly hired from the high salary of the Karendo Basin. He was able to build weapons according to his requirements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already late at night when the workshop came out. Cedros dragged his tired body back. At least until now, everything seems to be smooth, but even so, he only has about 80% of the plan to knock down this monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80%. This is enough for many things, but this matter has to be fully grasped. Once the failure, there is no retreat. The entire city of Oufu, which has been built up for more than ten years, has become a fly ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is a problem that makes him a headache. In the end, what can be done to ensure that the 'nuclear' is intact in the attack. It would be much simpler if you just shattered the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have promised that the young man will heal the young man, it is considered to let her go back with peace of mind. Even if the ‘nuclear’ is taken out intact, is it a legendary treasure that is really used to save people? Still handed over to the elf? What should I do there? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think you must have a headache now." Cedros looked down and just heard the words when he walked into the house. He looked up and saw a complete absence. Think of the people who will appear here. "I am going to ask the officials in the city that they are very busy, so I have to wait for you here." This person is dressed as if he is just sitting there casually but the one is out of the orc apprentice's rough and indiscriminate The chair seems to be infected with the temperament of his body. It seems to be a dignified furniture like the name of a famous craftsman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros smiled and said, "I remember that you used to have a speciality to help people treat headaches. Since you are here at this time, you must not It will disappoint me. There are many places where I have a headache."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person also laughed and said: "I hope that one night is enough. Actually, I It’s also a headache, so come to you and plan to work together to cure it. I have to use the flight to sneak in the darkness of others. I have to go back.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later. More than ten miles south of Oufucheng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sedros Gru is looking at the huge figure of the corpse dragon slowly appearing on the horizon. There are more than a dozen lizard people pushing more than a dozen huge cannons. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of gun has two people, one person, one person, one wide, one arrow, one person, how long, a huge force, enough to shoot through any shield within five hundred meters. It is a horrible weapon to match the lizard's vision that can adjust the focal length. The arrows that are now placed on it are all made up of a slender, spiral-like sharp corner on the special arrow. It is the unicorn's unicorned Cedros from the forests of Tula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really a magical piece of art. I really can’t bear to destroy it.” Cedrus shook his head with some exclamation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru faintly said: "But I am very interested in dealing with it." He looked at the dress next to Xiao Yan. "If I can really hope to play against it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only those who practiced the dark meditation can completely protect the robes come out. Otherwise, the skin exposed outside the robes will not withstand the burning of magic. Gru originally urged himself to wear this dress to fight face-to-face with this monster, but he gave up this dangerous idea after the strong persuasion of Cedrus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of the giant monster will undulate after re-coagulation and change, and the protection of the body will be minimized. He knows that Xiao Yan's skill is very good and she can only cover her body with her head face when she puts on her petite body so that she can only serve as the bait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another important reason. Cedros wanted her to do this task herself. Let her personally go to the leaf of the world tree to cure the person who had saved her with the leaves of the world tree so that she can go back to do what she should do without regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a spear in the hand of Cedrus, which was created by the blacksmiths of the three days of Oufu. Professional styling ensures that the thrower's strength and accuracy can be maximized. The tip of the spear is also a small cross on the corner of the unicorn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magician who possesses such a thing will never have more than five people who will not make it into a staff and will be carved into a talisman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpse dragon slowly approached and suddenly the pace accelerated. It didn't have eyes. It just felt that the breath that brought damage to it a few days ago was far away, so the instinctive action speeded up. It has to rush to melt all the things that give him uncomfortable feeling into his own flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let's get started," said Sedros. Xiao Yan nodded and looked at the huge monster. The huge body like a mountain is full of corpses. Every time there is a loud bang, the corpses seem to be rushing over here with the scent of the body screaming with the scent of the face. It's not something that manpower can contend with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you kill this monster and you can save him?" asked Xiao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. Certainly." Cedros nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to be increasing her courage in order to get such a positive answer. Screamed hard: "Okay. I went." Zema rushed toward the corpse dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedrus’s hands clenched the spear and spear and began to mourn the mantra. A dark mist spread from the spear and the unicorn's one-corner glared white light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the dark power of the Dark Force's ‘Dark Power’ and White Magic's ‘Pure Holy Blade’ is not a very high-level spell magician. But if you want to attach these two spells to one weapon at the same time without conflict, then the whole big 6 can only be done by Sedros. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unicorn's horn has the qualities to dispel the Dark and Necromancer spells, but it's also a very rare magic item. Only the elves who are close to the unicorn have their own possession. The ‘Pure Holy Blade’ attached to it is a solid body that can deal with the dead spirit monsters and break the corpse. More critically, it is guaranteed to carry the little necklace hanging on the spear into the body of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘The Power of Darkness’ allows the weapon to transform magic power into an explosive impact force as soon as it touches the other’s body. Although it is only a one-time explosion, it can increase the lethality of weapons. The attack power of such a weapon is as good as the legendary weapon that specifically deals with the undead monsters in the short time that these magics take effect. Moreover, the spearhead carries the great white magic energy in the cross. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros is now confident in this plan. But his greatest confidence is not that the weapon that he has gathered with so much energy and magic is not the one who has the help of an old friend but the one who will throw this weapon out. He handed the spear in his hand to Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is already the most knowledgeable and knowledgeable person on the 6th. But if you want to say something that he doesn't know, it is this friend who has been together for a long time. It is not clear to him until now what power is contained in his body. But only know that it is a force that will never disappoint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little man and the horse are close to being as small as a bug in the backdrop of the huge body of the corpse dragon. The green flame was spurting out of the dragon's mouth and only covered it for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good to put the arrow." Cedrus gave an order. The lizard people acted on the organs and more than a dozen long arrows and shot them on the chest of the corpse dragon according to the plan. The horn of the unicorn broke open the surface of the corpse dragon and nailed it to the chest. These dozens of arrows are surrounded by a circle that encloses the position of the leaves of the world tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru holds a spear. Only one step of dust and stones around the ground flew up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he stepped down in the second step, the same side of Cedros gave birth to the illusion that the entire ground had fallen with this step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third step is that the white light on his body is concentrated on the body and the body is tilted into a huge arc. With the sudden burst of the arc, the spear flew out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who have heard the thunder and lightning will never panic again for the explosion of the cannon. If you see this spear, you will never Then I feel that there is any mighty lightning strike. Even the heaven and earth will be eclipsed at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spears with black and white intersecting light are invincible and ruined as if they can rush through the power of the whole world. The roar of the surrounding air slammed out of the air can pull the human skin. The earth and stones on the ground where the spear flew were all picked up to leave a straight ditch like an artificial river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a roaring sound. The original tough body of the corpse dragon seems to be like a bread soaked with water. Out of this mighty and unparalleled ray, the circle surrounded by the horn of the unicorn is in the circle of the unicorn's front chest until the back runs through a huge circular tunnel that people can walk in. The corpses that fell in the sky fell into the green flame and disappeared without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spear itself did not penetrate the body of the corpse dragon. In the huge impact, the horns of all the unicorns and the cross of the magic jade were broken together and the huge white magic was released. The violent impact of the spear itself exploded and the body of the corpse dragon was torn apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A green leaf fell from the huge hollow in the corpse dragon. The white magic in the huge impact did not damage the leaves that contained vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the corpse of this leaf began to collapse. Like a huge building block, people suddenly took away the backbone of the body and hundreds of bodies collapsed completely. Just now, I was so powerful that I could despise all the creatures in this world. Just after this blink of an eye, I became a pile of stinky pieces of meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of vitality support These corpses began to turn into piles of mud and black water immediately after falling, exploding this long-lost rot . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse that was originally riding has completely disappeared in the green fire. Otaru immediately shrank his hands and feet into the robe and shrank his head into a ball when the green fire came. After hearing the roar, she felt that the flames of her body had dispersed and she had stretched her head and hands and feet out of the wide robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she almost fainted. The odor of this mountain corpse and the extremely rotten rot is not only a huge damage to the nose. The tears are also rolling under the attack of this scent. It seems that even the ears can hear the collapse of the tissue on the corpse and produce a huge smell in the air. A raging voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Prevention of disease'' treatment of poisonous recipes' 'healing technique' She immediately used several white magic on her body and then pulled up her robe and covered her nose Slowly open your eyes with only a small slit. Her magic is to follow Cedros, and almost every system will be point but not deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the countless rotting corpses in front, you can see a small pile of corpses still in the same way. Xiao Yan’s foot was shallow and walked in the rotten meat and the skeleton. The courage opened up and the green leaves were pressed in the middle of the body. Even in the midst of countless corpses, the flourishing business of this leaf is still as bright and dazzling as it is. Otaru took the leaves in the hands around the body and immediately began to fester. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white ball of light suddenly flies from the distant hills like a flying arrow without any wind. Seeing that it was going to hit the little cockroach, there was another illuminating light, but then a whisper of the first 啪 打 hit the little light ball. The light ball itself was not affected by the impact of this attack slightly changing the original flight track to a few steps next to the small dragonfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blast of the blast of the air caused her to fly out and land heavily on the ground. Xiao Yan stood up. If it wasn't for this robes on the body, it was just enough to make her seriously injured. She looked around and immediately there were a few light balls flying in here. Even thinking about what was going on, she was too late to run to the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several subtle lightning strikes on these balls that just change the trajectory of the ball so that the deadly magical power is only drained around. Go on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intensive explosions in the mud, the rotten meat corpses and water skeletons fly like a dead fireworks rain. In the dense explosion, Otaru’s loud noises and turbulence around the road seemed to drown her at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru looked at the place where the light ball flew out and snorted and reached out to Cedrus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedrus’s icicles, which are one-piece long and thin, are formed in his hands. This is the water magic used by the intermediate magician. '霹雳寒冰' originally only used the magic power of the water system to hit the target to produce ice thorns in the target body to cause damage, but Cedros will condense this magical power on the hand and will not go out. The moisture in the surrounding air condenses into ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The furious lich on the top of the hill kept waving his hands. The most advanced air attack magic ‘Thunder Bullet’ shot in her hands as crazy as the cheapest fireball. The perfect invincible artwork in my heart was just completely defeated by a portrait toy in the blink of an eye, which made Vadina stunned to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter how intensively her magic is next to Ronnie, she always plays a tiny flash of lightning and immediately hits each of the thunderballs. . The power of this lightning spell is not likely to be knocked down by an ordinary soldier but the degree and accuracy are controlled very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vadrina’s last half of her face was completely distorted. She glanced at Rooney’s body and looked up. She will never let the leaves of the world tree be taken away. She will use flying to kill all the people there and get them back to the leaves of the world tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a loud noise completely interrupted her movements and emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cracking sound after a powerful physical collision is not a magical explosion. An icicle was inserted in the gravel that was only a few steps away from her. It’s just the fragile ice, but with a huge force, a large hole crack is made on the solid granite. The icicles are like a monumental tree symbolizing destruction and strength, standing there against the coldness of the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru looked at the ice spear and then turned his head and said to Ronis: "If the students of the School of Magic also saw this, then I Make sure that at least half of the people will immediately abandon the demon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the lich is just a body but at least Ved Nina’s heart has its own The feeling of sweat. If this is the case, if her body is in the middle, she can spread her like a pile of broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t even have time to see that the ice spear had been inserted around her by the power of the mountain. And she knows that even if she sees it, there is no way. This is not the reaction of her body. It can be avoided without any magic to protect such a direct attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She now feels something is broken in her body. The body of her own body, the highest crystallization of human wisdom, possesses the highest magical body of the entire 6th. It is so fragile that it only takes a moment to become a pile of ruin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something she has exchanged for the beauty that has reversed the sentient beings. She has always been proud of herself. She has been more than any creature and is proud of not being able to succumb to time. Power and aging makes her feel that she has lived through this world. Especially after creating the huge and invincible corpse dragon, she even felt that she had become a god and could be compared with the creator. However, in this short martial arts, she has not yet awake in the shock of her own work failure and immediately appears to be able to die in the same way as other people in a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spear did not hit her but has smashed all her confidence and beliefs. She knew that if she really dared to fly over, the attack could definitely turn her into a pile of bone fragments before she reacted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru frowns. From here, the Ved Nina three were just a little black spot too far away to make this spear missed. He reached out to Cedros. "Give me another one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros smiled and looked at the distant three people and shook their heads and said, "Our things have been done." Finished. Let's go." Little squatting at this time has ran back. The three men led the lizard to go to Oufu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, Vadrina was struggling from this mood. The failure and the pain of loss have all turned into hostility and anger. Ronnis yelled: "Is it your ghost? They have no reason to know the strength of the fluctuations in the magic transition and master the time of the shot, except you. Someone can infuse such a large white magic on the weapon." Great anger makes her forget the original courtesy. The green flame behind the fake eyes seems to be dislocated and directly to the opposite side of the burning. Ronis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru also looked at him and said with a smile: "I said that three nights ago, when you went to the toilet, I thought you all night." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if I don't interfere with your work, I will be defeated. I am just helping people save the leaves of the next world tree." Ronis smiled and ridiculed The tone said. “Don’t you say that what we are doing is just a gear of history? Isn’t it that the exhibition of things is in your grasp? Why bother to be angry, why bother to be angry?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the moment of excitement, she became silent immediately and she didn’t even breathe. It seemed to suddenly become a dead object. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She regained her face as she reverently bowed to Ronis: "Sorry, the students are offended by the temper and the teacher is hoping that the teacher will not be surprised." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are many people who will blame." "If you don't care if I am here, you will probably kill him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich did not respond to Sandro’s words but faintly with her ugly voice. Said: "I have already thought about it. All this is the rotation of the gear of fate. This is all supposed to be born."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ronnie interrupted her words "I don't fight with you for these imaginary conceptual problems. How can we fight for it? We all just do our own set of things. It used to be." He finally glanced at the student. "We don't have a chance to meet after seeing it. I don't want to have another chance to meet again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vadrina finally nodded and said, "Yes. "She looked up again and looked at the green light behind Ronis's eyes." "But in the end, I want to tell the teacher a hint. This is what I just saw. The person wearing the Ghost of the Ghost King took the leaves of the world tree. It should be a young woman. I am a student who is willing to use the leaves of the world tree to save women. Why do you actually let a woman wear his clothes to take such a risk? And why are you willing to use your amulet to protect the leaves of the world tree? The teacher should know what I mean. I said the result must be It is already destined to be good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ronnis still said faintly: "I also said it and just said it. You believe in me." Believe me, we are doing everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The stage has been opened, whether it is those prosperous and false exhibition war politics or anything else will be staged But the results are certain. In the future, we will each play their respective roles to push this history to where it should go. Goodbye two teachers.” Vadinina opened a transfer reel and began to glow blue and white around the body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ronnis suddenly asked: "I finally asked a question to hear that you have a son?" He has been calm and vigorous, and there have been some fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know. Forgot." Or the hoarse and eccentric voice without any feelings. Ved Nina's figure completely disappeared into the blue and white magical light. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru looked at the disappearing light and shook his head emotionally and said: "This person is actually really good at everything." Then like commenting on the shortcomings Shaking his head and sighing. "It’s just that the head is too smart and thinks about things too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Humans laugh when they think about God. How do you think people are just people? Only." Ronis also took the delivery reel from his arms. "Let's go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru suddenly showed a very scared expression and said, "Oops, I think now that I have been in a hurry after receiving your notice. Burn it on the fire. The pot that I like very much must be burnt. Do you think it should be paid on the account of the Magic Academy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ronnis Slightly smiled and found a book from his arms and said to him: "I thought about it or return it to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh thank you But the pot still has to be compensated." Sandru took the book in his arms and took out the transfer reel and Ronnis pulled the two together and disappeared into the magic light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sedros three quickly returned to Oufu. Otaru took out the leaves of the world tree and fed Asa to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedros looked at the world tree leaves disappeared in Asa’s mouth and shook his head: "If you can make full use of the energy, this thing can make five low-level magic The apprentice turns into a legendary great magician. If you can shred it, it can be used to create ten magical items worthy of a price. If you can study it, the way it is composed of decades of complete analysis of the power.
