			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curtain of the tent unveiled a young man coming in. He gazed and looked at everyone inside and was very satisfied and nodded. "It’s still a shady place and it’s so delicious.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who brought you in? Get out soon." A nobleman saw him. The civilian clothes on the body are drunk. "What about the guards outside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man didn’t even mean to even laugh and said, "I am hungry, so come in and eat something." The smile is a bit more attractive, and the smile is even more beautiful and even a bit evil. Everyone seems to have been shocked by the strange charm of this face. Even the aristocrat who sipped was also embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor’s Majesty was a little sad to not understand the joke. The civilian costume of this beautiful young man quickly waved and said, “Don’t hurry him out. Give the hungry people some food and let him eat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man nodded to the emperor and revealed it was a very charming smile. : "Thank you, don't bother you, I will come." His smile made the man look pretty and charming, and the woman looked cute and cute. His bright eyes swept straight to the middle of the prime minister and his niece. The generosity of the emperor’s singularity and the singular charm of this young man’s smile did not blame him for his rude behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man completely ignored the empire of the prime minister and just stared at his niece Anasdazi smiled and said: "You are so beautiful." Ms. Nie was embarrassed to look at the very nice young man in front of him, especially the pair of dark eyes. The mysterious charm that seemed to be able to capture the soul was like a bottomless black deep sea. She looked at her feelings and her consciousness was slowly sinking inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This very hungry young man did not show any interest in a delicate taste on the table but reached out and grabbed the lady’s waist and put his mouth together. She got on her neck. This elegant action seems to be the intimacy of a pair of affectionate lovers. Unconsciously, there is an intoxicating atmosphere in the tent. It seems that everyone has been attracted by this beautiful scene, and no one has stopped it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Aristocrat seems to be immersed in this gentle hug, her expression shows complete intoxication and sweetness. But the fascinating blush on her face disappeared quickly and replaced by a nearly transparent pale. The young man’s mouth also ran out of blood all the way down the aristocratic lady’s pale chest and slowly slipped down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man released his hand and looked up and closed his eyes with a bloody red mouth. He said, "How many years have I been afraid that I have already I forgot this feeling. The blood of a woman is better than anything else in the world." His expression is satisfied with sadness and desolateness, and the aristocratic lady slowly falls down to the dead white face. It is still all intoxicated and romantic. It is a Love to the extreme to enjoy the beautiful expression of death for love is just the skin that has lost the blood, there is some dryness, it looks a bit strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene seems to be a lover of a pair of lovers, but it is a hysterical scream in the tent. The prime minister next to him jumped up and shouted: "Guard Guard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man stunned the fat aristocrat and seemed dissatisfied with his destruction of the atmosphere and then he He turned his head and shouted: "Guards!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curtains of the tents were not the guards outside but the two warriors. The weapons in the hands of the warrior and the broken armor on the body are all bloodstained. The skeleton of the skeleton is still holding the half-person's head, which is the guardian who was originally guarded outside. At the same time, when the heavy curtains were lifted, there was a strange noise outside, and there was a squeaking sound from the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are only my guards here, so please don't call them indiscriminately. The craftsmanship of these zombies is very good. It should be the fine works of the early days of the Necromancer." Young The human smile is still so charming. He sticks out his bloody tongue and licks the blood on his lips to reveal two sharp fangs. He stood up and faced the eclipse of the people bending over and taking a ritual. “I am proud to introduce myself to the Viscount Degar, the descendant of the glorious Dracula vampire family.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tent has been fried in pots The envoys and some aristocratic ministers all stood up and ran out. Only the prime minister and several ministers remembered to move closer to the emperor who had already been scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The self-proclaimed Degar's vampire waved in the air than in the elegant posture. Several magic symbols appeared in the air out of thin air and then quickly dissipated him like a greeting The child whispered softly: "Sit down." All the standing and running people immediately fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't panic. You see that I used such a large group to be hungry and hungry." The vampire slowly walked over to the countess who fell to the ground and picked her up and bit it around her neck. Many people in the tent have been crying and crying in the blood of the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't cry, I hate such an unpleasant voice." Degar sucked up the blood and raised his voice. His voice was as light and elegant as a very sophisticated and elegant man. The voice is like a laity. He snapped a finger and a huge three-headed dog ran into the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two big dogs have chewed human limbs in the two big mouths. The vampire's hand pointed the three-headed dog and immediately smashed out the most crying minister and then passed in. It was a scream that was not quite like a human throat. This voice made many people's pants immediately wet. Many people yelled like crazy and more people spit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whoever makes that disgusting voice, I only have to let him go to the dog's stomach." The vampire's voice is in noisy and crying. It didn't look too big, but the camp was quiet immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two cockroaches holding the still-blooded weapons on the tent's mouth, two pale bodies that have been sucked up by blood, a handsome and sinister youthful mouth Standing in the middle of the blood, with a look at the food, screaming at the people who were extremely frightened. The scene is very silent, the air is all solidified into a fear that penetrates into each person's pores and the sunlight that is transmitted through the window is strange. The noble people of this group of nobles and nobles are now all in the same way as the rabbits in front of the beasts, tears and tears in the face of the fear-distorted face. Many people are already vomiting, but they are forced to press their mouths against the ground and press them to make the sound smaller. The smell of urinating urine is permeated in this place that was just too noble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out of your evil things." There was finally a courageous minister on the ground who suddenly took a cross from his arms and tried to resist the slowness of his efforts. Threw it over to Degar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the vampire is holding his hand in the slender hand. He kissed the engraved image with his bloody mouth and kissed the engraved image on the head of the gold-carved statue. "The great Father made this stupid Don’t you have something to worship you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Degar’s hand crossed the cross and went to the brave thrower to kneel and put the cross on him. On the chest, whispered, "Do you think this thing carved with gold and jewels can protect you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is screaming that he has already made all of it. Strength and courage. Watching the vampire succumb to his own face, the mouth full of blood is desperate under his head. He now has no control over the strength of tears and snots. The extreme fear glared at his spirit and soon passed the limit. The muscles on his face trembled and twisted constantly, but he squeezed out a distorted smile and laughed louder than the screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Degar looked at the madman who shook his head and was very disgusted and sighed with disappointment. He didn't open his mouth to bite the ugly mad man, probably let him have no appetite. He raised his hand to the next. The minister made a scream and a wailing voice, and the blood that had come out of his stomach and even the vampire’s hand had been completely smothered into his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Degar did not stop here. He used the cross in the belly of the minister, like the child to play with it, and occasionally tried to pick up some The colorful things come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has been yelling that this is not an immediate fatal injury. His hands and feet can only be vainly moved like a frog in dissection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell of urinating in the tent was so strong that the aristocrats couldn’t help but be so horrified that they were dying dogs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Degar finally played enough to take the bloody cross out on the forehead of the minister and continue to say in that gentle voice: "Now you Pray to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cross fell into his scalp under the pressure of the vampire. The scream of the minister became more and more fierce, and finally with a clear ‘Cala’ finally stopped completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Degar stood up and raised the cross in his hand full of blood and other white things, shouting like a believer showing the holy device with a commanding voice: "All People are watching here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vampire looked at him with satisfaction and trembled around the crowd, looking at him desperately like a mouse in the pit. It's not just his food or a toy that is a bug that allows him to kill at will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see it, it won't come to save you." The voice of this monster is like a singer in the face of singing beautiful poems. The words have the charm of the gospel: "There must be no other gods except me here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, you may ask why I will appear in this place. Come and eat you?" The vampire looked around and fully enjoyed the feeling of being a master. "Actually, I don't know very well. I don't know who saved me from dust. I am resurrected. I also helped me prepare a table for this feast and those suitable men. From the costumes, it looks like you. Which country should be the royal aristocrats? This is really to thank the friend who arranged for me so well. In order to live up to his careful arrangement, I intend to choose a few from you to make you honored to become me. This should be the beauty of the well-arranged friend. He must know that our selection is very particular. It is important to know that vampires are incomparably elegant. If the blood is not enough, the status is not high enough to qualify for this trip. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Degar looked around and finally fell on Geffenhardt's body. "The first one is the kindly emperor. Although you are not very good looking from my aesthetic aesthetics, you can still get this reward in your noble blood and just politeness."加 /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Degar slowly walked towards Geffenhardt 17th, the young emperor’s face, I don’t know if I still remember my identity as an emperor, even if it’s extremely fearful. He actually didn't seem to be particularly embarrassed at least not yet scared the urine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor suddenly had a man slamming up and fucking a large plate on the table and smashing it to Degar. Degar was completely unprepared and was actually smashed and slammed into the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vampire held his head and regained his position and was sunk by a small piece. The plate is full of heavy meat and is thrown out when it is thrown out because of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of all the people in the tent are cast on the horror of this daring attacker but can’t conceal the beauty of the fresh nature. It’s always sitting in the emperor. Next to Chris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was once kidnapped and was considered to be a bloody scene and was not completely intimidated. I don't know why she didn't seem to be affected by the slowness of the vampire. Although her face was already bloodless, her body was shaking, but she still had the courage to know where to pick up a sword to stop in front of the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Degar’s hand licked his head and licked the dent and immediately disappeared. He looked at Cris's eyes without any anger, but he was all amazed and admired. "I haven't seen such a beautiful lady for a long time. Why can you break free from the shackles of my slow spell?" His beautiful eyes flashed like a nightmare, and the fascinating eyes shrouded Klis. "You are so beautiful. I decided that I want you to be my woman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cliss stunned at his forced eyes but immediately Waking up again, showing a fearful look back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vampire’s figure is just flashing and flashing immediately appeared in front of Chris, grabbing her hands and putting her in a dance-like graceful movement. Hold in your arms. Her reaction to the rebellion was too late to be born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But your shot is really not level to use who wants to knock down who? The timing of the shot is not right, at least should wait until I bite the young emperor completely When there is no defense, we have time. It will be a time of hundreds of thousands of years. I will teach you slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clys is His glamorous eyes flashing lightly stared at him and finally showed the same fascinating look as the aristocratic lady. The handsome and charming vampire glared at her like a kiss to a lover, and gently placed her mouth on her white neck. Her delicate skin has been recessed under the sharp teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time another person next to the vampire suddenly jumped up and shook a vampire into the head of the vampire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person has been lying on the ground and buried on the ground. It seems to be completely conquered by the monster’s momentum and slutty like other people. I didn’t dare to move, but this suddenly broke out immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timing of this man's attack is very good and his hand is absolutely embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shorts have completely fallen into Degar's head under the spurs and then emerged from the other side. But he did not stop because of this, but his hands continued to push the hilt and rushed forward to use the power of the whole body as if to put the hilt into the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Degar flew out and slammed into a thick tent under the violent push. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person actually didn’t let go of the hilt and immediately turned around and kicked off a table with a low table and picked up the table to pick up the sharp one. Duan and body sprinted toward Degar. A slamming table kicked into the vampire's chest and came out from the back and hung him all over the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people who are shaking on the ground have not had time to react. This person has already completed this set of attacks. The demon, who was just as fascinating as the world, has now hung on the wall of the tent like a specimen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great savior who completed the attack gasped for a few breaths and hugged Cris. Krys woke up from the shackles and immediately plunged into the man's arms and burst into tears: "Sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small Klees comforted:" It’s okay, it’s okay. The monster is dead.” Her face was flushed and pale, revealing weakness after being overpowered and extremely nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that she secretly used the dispelling spell on Chris to allow her to stand up and attract the vampire. Of course, this 'darkness' also includes Criss himself and she does not understand why she suddenly can move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dangerous gamble. Chris may not dare to stand up because she is too scared. She may feel that she is leaking the magic that she dispels. And the vampire may kill Klis more than just killing an ant. It’s more likely that his spell will fail and he will be alert to find someone who can dispel his spells. Then their two sisters will immediately become two. Dry corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s not gambling. No one in the tent has the only chance to fight. The only chance is to create it by yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even a small team of priests and magicians who specialize in dealing with ordinary dead monsters will never be a vampire opponent who can appear in the daytime. It’s only to gamble that the monsters who are proud of themselves and who have dominated everything here will be lazy to gamble that he will show interest in the beauty of Kris and come to reveal the flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clearly knows that the chance to gamble is only two layers. But if you don't gamble, you won't even have two layers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chance to gamble on two levels with the possibility of a younger sister being killed by a monster. She was already nervous to the limit and insisted on the will and perseverance to pervade all the power and fear at the most critical and appropriate moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But finally she gambled and finally got a chance to gamble. Although she was extremely tired, she also wanted to cheer for her luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of applause sounded. The very strong applause showed that the applause was also very appreciative of this attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small look up to see the person who appreciates her actions. After all, it is not easy to have a mood to cheer at this time. But she immediately did not applaud everyone. Under the influence of the spell, they were kneeling on the ground, or they stood quietly at the door of the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applause is a vampire that has been pierced by a tent. The nod of his short sword's hilt still looked like a ridiculous headdress on his head and shook his head. The vampire's face is still admired with the charming smile: "It's so good. It's amazing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small look back and surprise Stayed on her face for a moment. The next moment she immediately closed her eyes and mourned the mantra. A fierce flame ignited the golden flame from Degar's feet and swallowed his figure in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ‘Flame Wall’ of Intermediate Magic is the most powerful offensive magic she can use. And after eating the leaves of the world tree, her magical power is so fast that she can't help anyone in this magic without hurting her. She is very confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
