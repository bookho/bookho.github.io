			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness, even with just a few moonlights that are faintly visible from the clouds, the Glorious Castle still reflects a faint glow, looks like a The huge pearl is situated on the plains of Celeste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was first built hundreds of years ago, the Glorious Castle is already the largest and most magnificent building on the mainland, and these centuries have Has not stopped expanding. The long and tall construction group has been almost the same as a mountain. Among the squares, the towers are high and low, the grand hall, and the hill-like church. Although it may not be comparable to the architecture of the legendary Elves of the Elves, it is no doubt a miracle that human architecture can create. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a holy place in the eyes of believers. Legend has it that the day when the Glorious Castle was built, the holy glory of the horse descended from the sky, and there was a huge angel flying over the castle. Since then, the Glorious Castle has radiated a holy white glow throughout the year. This is the unquestioned god<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trace. There are often countless believers who come thousands of miles away, paying homage to the traces of this miracle in the world, and piously worshipping outside this huge white wall. This is the basis of their belief in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Meimei stood in front of the window and looked at the scene outside. The white outer wall of the bright hall in the distance reflected the faint moonlight. It looks like this. Holy and magnificent, like a holy place that does not eat human fireworks. But Ayimei knows that there are dozens of templars in the ambush, those who are all from the local elite, murderously waiting for the people who cast the net. The white magic of thousands of clergy in the entire Glorious Castle is enough to turn this night into a white, even a fly can not fly. On the towers scattered throughout, the Master is specially placed to display the magical eyes on it. Although this spell is an indispensable burden for magic, it is not a problem for the people in the Glorious Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her dream was to be able to enter this glorious castle one day. To be precise, this is the dream that his grandfather, Relas, has instilled in him since he was a child. In the eyes of the devout old Relais, it is privileged to be able to enter here as if to touch the glory of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dream is naturally already crushed by reality, and the old man of Relas died in the hands of the cardinal. Yabin died under the knife of the Knights of the Temple, and they were all killed in the whirlpool of innocent involvement. Celeste, the holy place in the past, is already in her mind to be no different from the nest of the evil spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, even standing here, seeing this holy and noble building that my grandfather told her carefully, she has only more disgust and fear in her heart. . She didn't know what Talis had said to Lancelot, and Lancelot brought her back from Nigan to Glorious Castle along with Talis. Lancelot was very angry with Talis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the Glorious Castle, she was confined. Ai Meimei is similar here. Although she did not put it in the dungeon, she also put her under house arrest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Mei is very smart, and not only smart, after so many storms, her cleverness has already been further transformed into tenacity and scheming. When she saw the three Knights of the Temple, she did not show any disappointment, and even when she saw the pocket of the man in Lancelot, her face did not change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lancelot said to her that she was going back to Celeste, she refused a little temptedly and saw Lancelot’s face. There was no slight change in the smile, so he immediately agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no power to resist. It is best not to show the meaning of rebellion. In this case, it is the only choice to follow the Knights of the Temple to the Cyrus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the rush of Lancelot and the Knights of the Temple, she knew that Asa had no accident, and that pocket was undoubtedly taken from Asa. She looked at the changes around these days, she also understood what was going to happen, but she was completely powerless and could only wait here. Unconsciously, it has been a month since I came here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She waited very calmly, very embarrassed, even the few pastors and swordsmen who were responsible for guarding her felt that this little girl was really cute and obedient. Have any vigilance, and talk to her from time to time. Although these people's tone is also very tight, Ai Meimei still learned from their mouths. Things are really as she is worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was in a hurry at the beginning, but in the middle of this glorious castle, she knew that she had no chance, so she was only desperate in the extreme anxiety. Until later, after fully understanding that he really did nothing, this desperation actually turned into a fighting spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he really comes, I must help him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you know that your magic is only a drop in the face of thousands of pastors and magicians, even one in a thousand may help To him. Ai Yimei still has this determination to rush out from here. She is waiting here for this. These days she was an unusually calm heart waiting to wait for the sudden riots in the Guangming Hall, or a person who was riding a two-legged dragon with the exclamation of countless people below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women are very weak and weak, I can’t see too many things, I can’t see other things and choices, only one or two simple thoughts in my heart. To support myself, but it is because of this weakness. So you can be astonished at some point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knocking on the door sounded, and most of the time it was the swordsman of the turn to give himself a meal. It was a young man with a face, and he would blush when he smiled. From time to time, he quietly sent some small things to call her and chat with her. Celeste rarely sees such a cute girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s not a swordsman who stands outside after opening the door, but an old man dressed up in a chores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have something?" Ai Mei asked, she looked at the probe, the outside guard was not there, the knife was a bit strange. The clergymen are more admired for the cleanliness, and the white magic is deeper. It is impossible to really eat the fireworks. It is impossible for the priests and templars to go to the kitchen to cook for the Pope and the bishops, so in the Glorious Castle. The chores are also quite a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is something, I am coming to you." The old man smiled. But the sound is not the voice of the elderly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai Meimei licked his mouth and used all his strength to make himself not called out, and the tears in his eyes had overflowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can hear that this is Asa’s voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Asa Big Brother... How come you? It’s so dangerous... they are waiting for you, when are you coming? Go away..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai Yimei screamed incoherently, not knowing if he should push him away, or rushing into his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding vigilance is by no means lax. After all, it’s Celeste. After all, this is the person Lancelot asked to see. Ai Mei has just left the prison. When I was in the tall building, I saw the swordsman and priest who fell to the ground and fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Asa, your sword is placed in the bright hall, but you must not go, I have seen at least dozens of holy The warrior..." Ai Mei was held in his arms by Asa, and his face turned red and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tonight is thirty-two templars, and there are about 120 senior priests in the vicinity, but there are no magic traps inside. Open." Asa holds a small Ai Mei, like a huge black civet cat walking silently between the houses, stopping for a group of swordsmen who have escaped from the shadows and avoided the inspection. After a while, quietly sneak. He smiled and said softly: "I have already felt very clear about everything here. You can rest assured. Since Lancelot invited me to come, I certainly can't let it be too disappointing... but he seems to only guard against me." Grab the hilt, it seems that I did not think that I actually found the inside here, use this method to mix in. This time I would like to thank Sedros..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the time when Oufu helped Sedros to do things, Asa was originally responsible for some secret activities. Although he did not directly deal with the people on the side of the game, the details are very clear. This time he found the priests who had been bought by Sedros, let them meet, and they made up an old chores. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this time he is still using the name of Oufu, which will allow these well-knit informants to take risks. He only helped Oufu for a year. The people below will naturally not know that in the eyes of these informants, Asa is still the special action captain of Oufu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
