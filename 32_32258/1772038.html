			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight swayed the silvery gentleness of the silver to the ground, and the rocky grounds of the eccentric 6 are no longer so sharp. Asa leaned against the stone beside the campfire and watched the moon reluctant to close his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight is beautiful and soft so that the bare skin can feel the rushing strokes. Such moonlight is absolutely invisible in Karundo. The clouds and soot that hang over the basin all year round make all the maps desperate to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has been out of Karen for more than a month. But as long as the taste of the iron and coal is recalled, the sound of the hammer hammering on the smashing iron in the nose seems to be less than a minute. The image of the father who waved the hammer in the night before he left in the mind was so profound that it almost replaced all the feelings of living in Karendo for twenty years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone-like and sturdy face is like a god in the fire. The muscles are like the roots of the tree. The hammers on the arm are hammering each time. Every vibration is actually passed through the knife to Asa. This is the shock from the father. This makes him feel for the first time with his father. A different connection than others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shape of the knife gradually became clear. The father took the knife from his hand and turned it over. Asa lost this pulsation with his father and he understood the connection with his father. It will dissipate as the knife is cast. What followed was an excitement. This knife also symbolizes the beginning of his new life is the beginning of his real life. This expectation also knocked into the knife with the snoring of the collision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be a good knife that even the father’s store doesn’t have been cast in the fine iron ore that Asa has secretly accumulated over the past five years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the most rebellious of the tens of thousands of children in the Karendo Basin. He was not as frivolous as other people when he was a naughty boy, so he would not return to life after being rebellious and tired like everyone else. He is not rebellious in life but will rebel against life from the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Calendo Basin has hundreds of years of metallurgical casting history. The mineral deposits on the high mountains around the basin seem to be inexhaustible. The dwarves are also used to interact with humans and even come out and live together. This makes the metallurgical level of this place the largest. People are also accustomed to this traditional generation to metallurgical casting industry. There are very few people here who are out of the basin and limit their footsteps as if they also solidified their hearts. Growing up in the environment of mining, smelting and forging, grew up and only inherited to become part of this environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The habit of many years has made the basin an unwritten rule that men must inherit the skills of their fathers or farmers or businessmen more than one to twenty years old. And blacksmith. Although this rule does not know when it has been handed down from the hands of anyone, it has been strictly adhered to a spiritual symbol that is not much in the basin of this culturally poor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa was no different from other children before the age of five and grew up in the fire and the beat. At the age of five, he became obsessed with the world outside the basin described by the old adventurer behind the village. The huge dragon that can easily catch a cow to the sky to eat, the beautiful mermaid who sings the sailor with his own voice, the corpse of the corpse, the various kinds of sub-human beliefs, the natural elements of the country, the strange habits of the country, and the floating silk. The infinite blue sky of the white clouds and mysterious and unpredictable seas and horses can not reach the end of the prairie for three days and three nights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the same as other children just listening and fantasizing these stories. Asa felt that it was the real life that truly belonged to him, so he began to learn the knowledge of the outside world from the old adventurers. How to survive in swamps and deserts How to identify various plants Various sub-human habits how to wrestle how to set traps. His footprints are scattered in every of the most bleak and most uninhabited places in the basin. It is the fantasy of the last month that is the magical world outside to practice his own viability. In order to let himself have a strong body, it is not inferior to the orcs. He exercises his body and a person who is much bigger than himself. When he is fourteen years old, the rogues and robbers of the whole basin are afraid to go to his place. Village. When he was fifteen years old, he went to the fine iron mine to find a good ore and tried to sneak out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father is silent and the boss of a small arms shop has long since died. In Asa’s impression, the family is just a place to rest. The father is just an elder who lives together. He has always lived in his dreams, and he is immersed in the accumulation of ore every day, immersed in the step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father did not stop him nor asked him where he was going. It was only after a long silence that he helped him send the ore to the smelter to make the refined iron into a knife. Then Asa left Karen with a knife and a caravan purchased by a foreigner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finger gently sliding over the blade is the whole life of his twenty years. One of the low-pitched words in the poems of a poem is like a song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good knife." It is like the ugly sound of two blunt knife blades rubbing against each other. The veteran next to the campfire woke up and stared at a one-eyed look at Asa's fire reflecting his face that was not quite like a face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half of the cheek of the face was concave and the bones and the broken bones were mixed into a bumpy meat. It was the trace of the hammer weapon. . The other half of the face was struck by a deep, long knife from the forehead to the mouth. There were also a few small points of shallow knives, and the five senses were pulled apart by the knife. . This is a face that was made strange by the scars. What is even more strange is that this person is still alive with so many injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa gave the veteran a friendly smile. This is a veteran who has been on the battlefield for decades and has never been killed. He is said to have injured hundreds of people in size. Because he always can't die, many people in the army call him "old and not dead." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did you do it before?" Seeing that the knife was not a standard equipment veteran of the regular force, Asa was a single mercenary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa shook his head. He saw the recruitment of mercenaries in Bracada. It is not a simple matter to live freely outside when he comes out of Karen. It takes money to eat adventure items. It is almost necessary to consider looking for a thief to join in or to help a rogue fight when you see a reconnaissance unit recruiting temporary soldiers to sign up immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half of this 100-person force was temporarily recruited near Bracada. There are peasants who have wanderers who seem to have a few fugitives mixed in and not busy with the rules. And this seemingly weird veteran is actually a regular soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The veteran probably couldn’t sleep and talk to Asa: "The young man seems to have a good hand and think of it as a soldier?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because there is nothing else to do, I am actually trying to be a robber." Asa said honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veteran Kaka gave a laughter like a rotten beater. Asa noticed a scar on his throat that probably hurt the vocal cords. "The young man is interesting. In fact, sometimes the robbers are at least not as dangerous as the soldiers. If the robbers have been beaten, they will not be able to fight. If the soldiers should escape, the chief may even call you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you can't escape if you don't rush."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Violation of the military order The sir can cut your head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then only the head of the sergeant should be cut first and then escape." Asa himself answered the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veteran Caracalla also laughed for a while: "Where is such a soldier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Obviously knowing that to go to death and being directed by others, how can there be such a person?" Asa felt that she did not understand. "Of course, I have to find a way to survive. Call me to die. Why don't you go up and die for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The veteran shook his head and left the only one eye The distorted facial features of the stunned eyes were moved to become a distorted expression that could not be understood by others. He said, "When the soldiers are like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sound of Kayka’s voice, Asa, knew that Captain Sanders had come. Only he would still be wearing a steel armor patrol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can I still sleep? There are still tasks tomorrow." Captain Sanders is still fully equipped. A steel armor with a steel helmet left waist with a sword and a right waist hanging shield. These things seem to grow on him and never see him off. The armor and the shield have a concave cross of the Holy Cross. Asa heard that it was the symbol of the Paladin. The Paladin was in the dull place of his hometown. It was the most powerful one in the Empire. force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are exchanging the experience of being a soldier." Asa is still telling the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
