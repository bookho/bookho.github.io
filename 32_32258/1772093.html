			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa returned to Bracada and heard that the new commander had arrived and immediately went to the City Hall. The general and the five thousand soldiers must be accounted for to the Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to the commander’s room but saw a British and handsome Jun Wei, a knight’s armor, a clean golden yellow roll, and a neat knight. Sitting gracefully in the position of the commander staring at himself. The knight and the rudimentary garrison have nothing to do with the appearance of the squad that he saw at his wedding not long ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa frowned at him and looked at his disgusting expression on his face. "What about Duke Mulke?" Although he used to have nothing to do with this guy. Now that I see this, I don’t know when I’ve been extremely annoying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis’s face is not very good-looking and replied: “The Duke will take a step back because of something, and I will be in charge of it for the time being.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa snorted and said: "I knew that I was coming a few days later. Now I am in a bad mood. It is even worse if I look at the hateful people."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa feels that status is still good for the first time. Laozi, what about the sorcerer of the School of Magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis’s face immediately became iron and blue, and he used a lot of effort to keep the number of rituals with a somewhat unnatural business official tone: I heard that the priests went to chase the generals who had smuggled the soldiers and did not know if they had caught up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catch up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you have been with their troops all the time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what about their people now? Have you fought with Oufu?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are all dead." Asa didn't want to talk nonsense with this guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis’s eyes jumped cold and asked: “Is it all dead? One does not stay?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Asa also replied coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis’s eyes swept Alsa up and down and said, “How can you come back safely? See you as if you didn’t receive anything. The injury is not even broken, can the orcs be reluctant to hurt you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "呃" Asa language plug can not really tell how it is going back. "I am hiding elsewhere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis did not speak his blue scorpion or looked straight at this obvious lie. Asa looked at him without showing weakness. Two people are facing each other. After a long while, Crowvis suddenly screamed: "Come on. Take this traitor to me." The outside screamed into a group of soldiers but could not figure out that it was a sage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa angered: "What are you ah?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowway The righteous words of the righteous words are sounded: "You are a god officer but have not commanded the pastors to stabilize the military. This led Sanders to seduce the military to bring the soldiers privately. And if it wasn't for the collusion with the orcs, then the five thousand soldiers would be all inked. Didn't you escape you without hurting? According to the search for the generals, the troops have gone out of the way for at least hundreds of miles. How come you come back so quickly? Just a sentinel report said that there were orcs in the ten miles but the dragons appeared. Just wandering and flying away, then you will be back at this time. Where is it so clever? Isn’t the evidence that you are colluding with the orcs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This is grace" Asa really can't explain this time. He did return with the Wyvern and did not consider these issues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that I heard that the sect of the priest was indeed walking back without riding a horse." A small captain wondered about the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers have some doubts. Clovis completely took the advantage of the hand and waved: "This is not evidence? If you dare to resist, you can kill it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Duke of the Duke. You are coming so soon." Crowvis's expression was a little scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it’s fast. If it wasn’t for the time to stop this misunderstanding. Fortunately, I heard that the priests came back, so I immediately rushed over.” Mulak The duke waved his hand and let the soldiers go out. He looked at Asa and smiled awkwardly to express his affection and apology. "Everyone is young people are too impulsive, so sometimes it is inevitable that there will be more offense between the words. He doesn't know that we can be regarded as the same front. It is not good for anyone who has a mutual feud. Please also ask the priests for forgiveness." Lawless waved his hand. "Don't apologize to the priests?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it. No one else here does not need any boring rituals. How can we not know what is going on?" Asa spread his hands. "Well, I know that this is not good for anyone. Fortunately, the Duke of the Great, you come to explain the things here, I will go back to the king to find the bishops. So that everyone is young and easy to be impulsive." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That can't be an official." The Duke's smile today is particularly friendly and friendly. "The reason for my delay is because this matter and the bishop have an important task to hand over to you. This is a very important task. The bishop is strongly recommending that you can do it. You are already. Prepare a follow-up group to accompany you to Oufu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah? What group?" Asa is inexplicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Affiliate. Come with you to Oufu to agree and sign a peace agreement. You are now shouldering the glorious mission of bringing peace to both countries." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it seems to be a bit of a hassle, it’s just an additional task that doesn’t take much time. Asa frowned and nodded and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa left the room with only the Duke and his deputy. The face of the Duke began to gloomy and silenced for a while and then said coldly: " He must not be able to start with him in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the evidence is enough. You can use the crime of committing the enemy to immediately put him on the spot to be in the 40,000 army. It’s impossible to run away.” Clavis tried to justify his impulses. "The existence of this person is too dangerous"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Killing him may also make us unable to eat and go." The duke's face became more and more gloomy. I am impatient. The savvy and energetic look of the past has disappeared. The face of the fat and kind face is now frustrated and angry, making him look like a businessman who has just eclipsed his business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis was surprised. The time he followed the Duke was never short. He never saw the Duke have such a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person’s frustration seems to be no big deal. However, the Duke’s such savvy and astute savvy city, such as the political turmoil of the sea, is also like a high-profile figure on the spur of the sea. Clavis almost doubted whether it was going to collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the sky will not collapse. And now the situation seems to be very good, and I can't see anything wrong with it. The Duke has now successfully taken over the military power and can immediately stage the stage as soon as he follows the planned grand drama. So Clavis really didn't know why the Duke had such a reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But curiosity is curious, but Krauss did not ask. He had already seen some unusual light in the eyes of the Duke and he knew that a good assistant would always have less to do more. So he immediately went to inform the generals in the army to meet the new commander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one duke in the room. Sighing again at the duke of the empty room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he condensed and looked at it carefully and listened carefully. After determining that there were no people around him, he flew up and kicked a stool against the wall and smashed. At this moment, his kindness and grace, which seems to have become part of the appearance, suddenly disappeared completely. The slender eyes no longer have the slightest smile, but the cold and fat people who can take the eyes of the people. The majestic murder on the face is no worse than any of the generals who have fought in the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after the next moment, the Duke’s face returned to its original state. After waiting for a while, other generals and Clavis will be able to see a very friendly, very kind and very friendly duke. Of course, there is a trace of exhaustion that cannot be concealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setback was that the agreement between him and Oufu failed because of the kid’s involvement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s plan goes back a few years ago. At that time, he learned from the mouth of Cedrus that he intended to establish an orc city state and immediately expressed his extreme support. The Duke does not only give Cedros a lot of material help. What is more important is to secretly find a way to block any news of the city to reach the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficult task of completely building a city-state through the sea is extremely dangerous even with the Duke’s means. Although the two are considered friends. But for those who do big things, the great friendship is not too big. The Duke’s willingness to do so can only be because of the greater interests and future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the Duke had just received this incomparable title, but he also knew that his career had basically come to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is indeed very capable and very capable, all the bureaucrats of the empire will not be his opponents, but his fame is already There is no way to go. Being a low-level aristocrat with no background can go to his height is already a miracle, but there are no miracles, no background, no background, no one, no one, no magical means, and no one can compete with those who have many people. Even the hereditary nobility who had a strong relationship with the El Ni family was only thinking about using his abilities and would not really treat him as his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the military, according to his ability, it is possible to slowly embark on the peak of power. But in the age of peace, the degree is too slow to fully satisfy his eager and huge ambitions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is only one chance for Qingyun to go up, then war and crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only when the empire is in danger can you fully demonstrate his high ability. Only turbulence and chaos have enough opportunities for him to fully use the subtle means. And conspiracy to remove obstacles to get enough oil and water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And an orc’s city-state suddenly appeared out of thin air on a wild land that had always been considered an imperial territory. This will definitely cause the attention of the military, which has always wanted to use military power as a political capital, to be inevitable. But as long as Cedros is ready, let the orc troops have a certain size as long as they are led by General Gru. The duke never believed that the empire's troops had a chance to win, just as they did not believe that eggs would eat people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle with the orcs will immediately cause the ruling and the wild to fall into a chaos and take the opportunity to marry the Elni family through their daughters. The good relationship between the two sides is regarded as the embarrassing status of 'own people', plus some wrists and their well-known abilities, which can be logically assigned to the crisis of the country's survival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle after the takeover of the army was purely performance. As the Duke of the conditions that helped Cedros demand, this kind of cooperation on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a must to win but it’s never going to be smooth and bloody. The horrific combat effectiveness of the orc troops is already well known and it is the true general style of the rebellion. But the failure of the dead wounds may be those generals and troops who do not control well. Such damage is absolutely pleasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winning can't completely recover the situation of defeat. Cedros will never promise to lose the precious orcs he has tried to keep. Those big ear monsters that are not well managed are excellent cannon fodder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military between the two sides has stagnated on the high ground for a period of time. The pre-arranged diplomatic strategy of Cedros has begun to take effect. The diplomatic pressure of the countries will naturally make those politicians have to stop the war. . At this time, I can use the subtle whispers that I have buried in advance to change from the battle hero to the peace messenger to negotiate the peace agreement. Of course, this kind of transformation is even more in need of high-performance performances and means, with the cooperation of allies, the Duke will handle the traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final outcome is of course great joy. Oufu's successful establishment is not to mention that its military power is at hand for a while. The key to being a small person under one person is to lay the foundation for a broader future of greater action.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really a great The layout is subtle and deep, and the unique strategy of the art is absolutely unique. Even the Duke himself is proud of this plan. The need to take care of the implementation of this plan is the cumbersome details of the large and small layouts that must be taken care of before and after the buckle. Looking at the whole world, only the gods of the sages of the dictatorship, such as the Duke, can complete it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
