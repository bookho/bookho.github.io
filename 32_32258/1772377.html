			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really the autograph of His Majesty..." The Cardinal and several great priests guarding the Great Hall of the Light carefully looked at Ade Pull out the letters. Although the handwriting is very sloppy, it is probably the time when the Pope wrote this, but it still shows that it is indeed the Pope’s handwriting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, because the Summoning Guardian Angel has exhausted all of his life. I was going to come out and ask someone to come, but it’s too late to say that he confessed me. Afterwards, I just left this letter in a hurry and the ring died for me.” Adela’s hand that the seemingly inconspicuous king’s ring was on his ring finger. "Now the death of the sire in the extraordinary period can not be leaked for the time being. I am under the command of the priest to serve as the pope. It is only a temporary interest. I am waiting for this storm to calm down. Please ask the cardinal to renegotiate and select talents. So now Please also cooperate with me." Although there is still a sad color, the words of Adela's bishops are self-sufficient and have a top-down majesty. It is also very reasonable to say. So the cardinal also nodded. "I understand that this is the order of His Majesty the Pope..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it really the command of the Pope?" Slot looked at Adela coldly and he took a step and walked towards the Great Hall of Light. "I am going to see the body of His Majesty the Pope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The body of His Majesty has been burnt by the Flame of Light. It is forcibly summoning the guardian angel and using it. The consequences of Purdue beings are brought to heaven by the light flames and souls. "Adra said lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I first heard that there was such a thing." Lancelot turned and looked at Adela his eyes had already picked up. Slightly shot in the face of the acting pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adra shook his head and did not feel the slightest unnatural sigh and said: "That is because His Majesty is the first ever to be able to use twice. Those who cross the sentient beings and summon the guardian angels. Celest has only used one of the Pope's sentient beings for centuries. It is also necessary to burn the life at the expense of using this curse, not to mention the call of the guardian angel. It’s traced. The soul of the Majesty has already been recognized by the great God. How can it have this ability?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot snorted Did not speak. The light in the eyes is even more fierce and seems to want to poke Adra's soft and beautiful face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of God, like her, Lancelot certainly does not believe, but these can not be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since this is indeed the death of His Majesty the Pope, Lancelot does not need to worry. The situation is not stable now is not the time to spend on these matters. Let's go. "Inham has a smile on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This variable he did not expect. Although he also guessed that this battle will definitely kill the Pope's energy, it is not surprising. But I don't know how Adela got the book and got the position of the pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, people who are good at calculations hate accidents. The more they are good at calculating, the more they hate it because Ham is even more so. But for such an accident similar to the falling pie in the sky, no one will feel disgusted. The laugh on his face has been out of control. It’s no longer the kind of mask-like smile, but it’s really happy to laugh. He hasn’t been so happy for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the official pope is still in the cardinal through elections, but now the remaining cardinal is no longer he and Ade Pulling the hand, this temporary acting pope does not need to 'temporary' and then 'agent'. He has not taken care of Alice in the back of Lancelot. Whether it is a paladin or a shrine knight, it must be obeyed by the pope. This is iron, so the leaves are no longer necessary to worry about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, for the time being, not to delve into these..." Another cardinal also nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think it's this time. It seems to me that there is nothing more important than this." Lancelot did not let it. His eyes even began to have a murderous murder. Maybe other people are not clear but he is very clear about the background behind this acting pope. Especially in the case that even the pope's body could not be seen, he guessed what had happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lancelot's position as a paladin is just a battle. The orc can figure out in that direction or say..." Because Hamm is still laugh. "...or do you want to rebel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
