So you have to let your brother manage this country more suitable." Gru looked at the three tribes who were sitting. "You can rest assured. The power of Prince Taize and the people you are in fact are also clear. Even if you have dealt with him, it is only a political choice that favors the powerful camp. He will not hate. So after the replacement of the throne, whether it is your private interest or the rights of the tribe It won't be hurt or even benefited."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three tribes looked at him stupidly and didn't know what to expect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Hari, who has always been arrogant, is about to accept a little sanction. All of your family’s property and rights and interests must be spit out." I saw the Hari patriarch sitting next to the king. That is the uncle of King Brown. "But what is going on is still waiting for the next king to tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha." Roske suddenly burst into laughter. The sound echoed wildly in the hall. "I don't think that the general of Oufu is actually a madman. Hahahaha..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patriarch of the Hari also laughed together and the King of Brown also smiled awkwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I say this is what the Shadow Sage means?" Gru's expressions and voices are cold and cold with no fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laughter of the three people stopped. Immediately, Roske laughed even more: "Even if I lie like this, I want to find out that we will find a guard at the gate of the palace tomorrow and go to the generals of Europe to be more useful than this guy...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru took out a piece of things and threw it at the conference table. The laughter that immediately interrupted the prime minister also made the expressions of others solid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a gray jade card that was chained into a necklace by a very thin chain. It’s just that the jade chain is made of a high-tech craftsmanship that has been smashed into a piece of the finest jade. The gray jade card is not eye-catching, but the eyesight is better. The gray color is the illusion of numerous small uniform black lines and white lines. The black paint is black and white in white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a jade brand is invaluable whether it is naturally generated or acquired. The words embossed along those lines are even more shocking to the people here. The heart of Tetaglia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Shadow of the Card." Roske's voice and expression twitched together. He doesn't even have to look at it with his eyes, only by the faint magical fluctuations above. It was his teacher, the shadow sage Nimbas, who wore anything that never left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Shadow Sage left me this thing and asked me to come to Taitalia to arrange this." Gru said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This....how can this be a teacher...how to make me..." King Brown was shaking his body all over his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible." The prime minister robbed the jade on the table. The sweat on his forehead is no less than that of the king and his expression is distorted and scary. "This... this jade card is you stealing... you grab it....no...nothing..." Even he couldn't say anything anymore. The shadow card is hung in his teacher's neck and never removes. If this can be stolen, then it is not difficult to steal the head. But how can a great shadow sage kill people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is never possible." Roske shouted hysterically. "The teacher is clearly with me...how can I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you with? Killing the old king with you and supporting this straw bag on stage? So you think He will never do this now?" Gru's faint tone of calm expression still has not changed. But everyone else was scared by this sentence and almost jumped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosker’s face suddenly became stiff. The expressions of other people are all shocked. Of course, there are also different levels of shock. Some people think that it is a stone-shattering and intelligent person who has hinted at the subtleties of it. He just didn't expect someone to say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosker’s face gradually became dark red from the stiff green and then boiled up. He jumped up like crazy and shouted: "Come on, come and come." The guards will grab the madman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Brown also began to react and shouted. "Come and kill him." Suddenly four figures emerged from the shadow corner of the big temple and surrounded the king. Taitalia has been in the war with Erasia and the harassment of monsters in the northeast. The brave men who grew up in the battle and many of the Kings of Brown have specially selected a few from the folks since they fought for the throne. Pick a martial arts master to protect yourself. Although the style of Prince Taize has made these people useless, it is now a more important opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Gru did not even look at it. The four people just said faintly: "He is not a king right away. You can not follow his orders. He paused. "Of course, it doesn't matter if you want to take the initiative to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said these words are still very dull, but this kind of dullness gives people a more deterrent and shock than any madness. The fierce violence is stronger and deeper. That is far from the threat of intimidation between the same kind of fangs and bright claws, but the calmness and calmness of the lion when facing the mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people looked at Gru and they didn’t move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong with you?" Brown King was shocked and angry. He remembers that these people were more fierce than the wolves when they were dealing with other people. Just as they ask for the price. He shouted: "Who killed him and I gave him five hundred gold coins!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these four are still not coming forward. Although the wolf is fierce, it is not without a head. They always know that they are facing a rabbit that can be eaten or a behemoth that has been pinched into meat. Looking at the man who didn't even look at them in front of the words, the four men continued to sigh and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown King is completely stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, a few people coming in from outside the gate did not seem to be screaming at the prime minister’s screams. They were not slow but they were not happy. The face of the prime minister is even more ugly. He saw a few thick and long tails on the buttocks of the people who came in. Whether it is the lizard who should have disappeared in the northeastern border or the person that Gru has brought from Oufu, it can be said that the problem is far more serious than imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before a few lizards are people who are wrapped in animal skins. This man is in his thirties and has a brown head and the color of his clothes. And his appearance is ugly, and the five senses are combined together in a very strange way to make him look like he is laughing at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prince Taize." The other three tribes exclaimed at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure appears silently behind the Gru is actually the Hari patriarch. He glared at Gru's conversation to other people as if he didn't care about him when he didn't care about him. He quietly left his seat and turned to Gru and pulled out his sabre from his waist and rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horror and deterrence of the behemoths can certainly scare the wolves, tigers, leopards, etc. but not necessarily everyone will be afraid. For example, locust ants and mosquitoes will never care about it and will always be brave enough to challenge the offense. The ignorant can be fearless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fearless results are usually not very good looking. Just as he got up and even his face was full of murderousness, Gru turned his body and stretched his hand back to the seat that belonged to him. Soft and casual without the slightest anger is as easy as pressing a ragdoll that is not moving there. The patriarch who fell back to his seat immediately stunned like a rag doll. It was only in this blink of an eye that at least twenty bones were broken up and down in his body. The sudden pain caused by him suddenly made him faint and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru turned and there was another person who suddenly got up and pounced on him. Although this figure is slightly fat, it is still very abnormal. It was actually the Brown King who had been sitting on the throne and his expression was distorted and his body was trembling. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, he grew up receiving education and exercise from the head of a country, and he has not lost his fighting spirit in this sudden change. The slightly blessed body jumped out and pulled out the carry-on. The timing of the shot is very suitable for the posture of the shot is more fierce and pungent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the sinister ants are still an ant. Gru didn't look at him. He just waved his hand casually. Brown King also flew back to the throne with a green onion. Unlike his uncle, his fat face has become a tomato that has been stepped on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The King's Majesty has already died. It seems that even the Zen can save the throne. Can you say that it is a prime minister?" Gru turned and looked at Roth. His attention has never left this. It must not be considered as an ant should be stronger than the wolf. This talent is his most concerned object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ross is as stiff as a puppet, where cold sweat drops down the chin. He is actually the first one to be moved by everyone, but only because his movements are too slow, so it is his turn now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hands and a shadow of the thorn on the chest are ready. Obviously this magic has been as tight as the arrow on the string, and the smallest action can be shot out. The magical lethality is absolutely beyond doubt. But when Gruard's dark scorpion fell on his eyes, he did not have the guts to move the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you want to try it?" Gru smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince of Taize and the lizards who walked into the main hall were standing still. They did not go back here and left the tribal collars and left the seats. No one wants to be close to a magician who can burst magic at any time, not to mention the horror of the court magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ross still does not move but the face is distorted and screamed exhaustively: "You, Prince Taize, dare to collude with the outsiders to stab the king to interfere in the internal affairs of Tatalia. Do you think that each tribe will recognize you as a traitor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he shouted his eyes, he would not leave Gru. The person who stood there and did not have the slightest movement and was much taller than him not only shocked him but also completely controlled the spirit and momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop." Prince Taize drank. His voice is so excited that his mood is so excited. It was just that ugly strange looks that made his angry expression look like a smile. "Is this guy also qualified to say that I am selling the country? You quietly killing the father and then supporting my brother as the king. You are the real scourge of Tatalia. Without you and the Hari people, there are real people of other ethnic groups." Good days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Shadow Sage will not forgive you." Roske's voice is already like a beast screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces of Prince Taize and the other three tribes have changed. After all, the name in their minds is about the same as God and more deterrent than any god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not talk nonsense." Gru's cold voice sounded. "Let me see how much you can have Nimbas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ross can suddenly become whiter than the dead. He has already understood some things, although he does not want to believe, but the feeling of mad despair and horror in his heart is even his own understanding that the god in his heart is indeed dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face changed from white to green from green to red several times. Finally, when the red seems to be bleeding, all the emotions in the heart burst out like the volcanic magma. He used all his strength to yell: "You are nonsense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scream of the hall shouted in the hands of Roske, who had accumulated a lot of magic and. A gray light beam spurred from his hands to Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drink." A louder, stronger, and hundreds-times louder than Roske’s voice. If Rosko is just a gong, the sound is now a tsunami. The whole hall seemed to tremble slightly in this voice. Everyone, including the ears, was so busy that even the lizard people without ears also hurriedly held down the two small ear holes on their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time the hall was filled with white light. Gru still stood in the same place and did not lift it up. It was just a white light that suddenly appeared out of the crowd. This vindictive light only disappeared in a blink of an eye and disappeared more than a meteor but also far more embarrassing than a meteor. The gray magical light column that was directly directed at his chest was like the same light smoke. The storm immediately disappeared in the whirlwind of white light and thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Roske out of this magic doesn't care about this. Just throwing this magic, he was already flying back while holding both hands of the shadow card and yelling over his head: "Go all to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
