			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the war broke out and the two fell down, Luya felt at least five or six pulls on the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, she has always felt such power before. It was the magical masters that the air magicians controlled very well. They wanted to pull her directly from the back of the donkey. It was only because the dragonfly had been flying through her and hiding in the crack behind the skull. But now that the cockroach has been disconnected, the trajectory of her whereabouts is also very clear. Immediately, the Air Master continues to use the wind to pull her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, you must not let these Necromancers get the leaves of the world tree anyway. Protecting the light and life against the darkness is the mission of the elves. These concepts have long been branded into the deepest part of my mind countless times, so she immediately jumped out of the sly back. This angle just used the sturdy body to block the sights and spells of the air magicians. The forces that pulled her away immediately disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a subconscious movement to protect the leaves of the world tree in the hands, but when she makes a jump from the back of her, she realizes that she is doing this. It seems to be looking for death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a huge ancient tree below two or three hundred meters high and looks like a grass. She does not use the most basic air magic feathers to drop directly with her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it is obviously regrettable to be late. Now even if the air magician pulls her with the genius, they can't pull it. She is only free to fall down with her huge body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the wind coming in the ear, I can’t hear anything from the ground. The original small things are flying and becoming so big that the degree and the difference can be almost Imagine the feeling that when you hit your body and the ground, it must be as painful as a broken egg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to die? Luya only felt that her head had become empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally thought that as long as it is for the sacred mission of the elves. You can face everything calmly. But when the hand that really feels the death has already held it, it will be like a pinch of a bug, and the most basic and primitive fear of the most life will be swept away from the heart like a tsunami. And to wash everything else out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scream that she hasn’t heard before, she’s rushing out of her throat and seems to be ignorant of herself’s screaming that she can’t grasp anything. Still keep drawing in the air. The instinct drove her to use all the action and sound she could do to escape the seemingly inevitable impact of colliding herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light bang of Luya feels that his back finally feels, although it is also very heavy impact, but it does not seem to be the kind of expected to hit himself The feeling of decay. Although some pain. But it is very practical and safe. The figure is still falling but the degree has been greatly slowed down. It seems that there is a lot of resistance together to reduce the strength of her falling from a height. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not dead? Luya returned a little bit of God. She is now in the arms of a person or the person who jumped into the air to catch her around and reduce the momentum is the feathering technique used by this person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you obviously have the ability to jump down? It seems that you are not the person who can't think so." The man looked at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it you?" Although the man took the mask, but Luya still recognized the sound and eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aiden Master in midair looked at Lucia and was caught. A little glimpse immediately followed a submarine like a goshawk. The leaves of the world tree where he does not dare to use the spell of direct attack, but as long as it is still in the air, it is his world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blue water curtain suddenly flashed in front of Aiden’s dive and then turned into a water-filled pool full of water and his swooping body suddenly slammed The side slanted and rolled out. After playing two or three in the air, I slid out of the distance and stopped the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the sharp change in this high flight is the proof that his air magic is superb. The whole big 6 is absolutely no second person can make it but this action and posture It seems that it is awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
