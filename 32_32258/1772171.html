			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tulalin Forest is located in the southwestern border of Erasia. Ten days after the departure from the stronghold near the Five Cities, a bandit has arrived at the forest in a mighty way. edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest of one of the Big 6 is hundreds of miles wide and nearly a hundred miles wide. If you only look at the forests from the periphery, it is a good place for individual animals to be harmless. But the people in the depths of the forest are not so hospitable, and the temper is not known. The whereabouts of hundreds of thieves have been careful to arrive here and there have been no major accidents at least not noticed by the army of Erasia. On this road, there are thieves from all over the place who have been summoned by Helica. The number of thieves has reached 400. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only little trouble is inside the thief. It was said that more than half of the thieves in the spot were very clear that they heard the voice from the room of Mr. Sandefes. The woman who came out from the inside only let the dozens of thieves incontinence by their throat. The shouts have been going on for a long time and have changed different content and monotony. The voice of the thieves who had been extremely nervous and had escaped for a whole day was extremely incomparable. Helicia immediately demanded that the thieves must hide the trails in the direction of Tula Leone. Needless to say, it is not good to go to find a prostitute for the company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s even more so that the sound of the fire is actually stopping at night. And it lasts longer. It’s even louder and more unremarkable. Just a day or two, the thieves looked at the black woman’s eyes as if they had been smelling a piece of meat for a decade. I can't help but force the layer to figure out the sturdy body shape of the sturdy body and then go deep into it and madly smash and explode. But undoubtedly this is really not a piece of meat that can be swallowed at will, especially when the meat is being chewed in the mouth by another beast. Hungry again, there are very few people who will not want the upper body for the urge of the lower body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is only rare, not absolute. On the fourth day, four thoughts were deprived by the following heads. The thieves quietly found an opportunity to deceive the black woman’s excuses with the invitation to discuss the plan in the evening. But if they want to come, they shouldn't be impulsive to the point where the high-skilled masters who want to pay for this Helicel are probably only negotiating and discussing, but no one knows how the process is. Only the woman in black soon came back and then called the man named Sandefies louder and more intense in the no-man's place. The last day is coming out. The four thieves appeared in the trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four thieves are still not dead but almost dead. They were all interrupted, stripped of their hands and feet and dumped on the tree. Things that should have been between the legs have been cut and stuffed into the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other thieves who are mad at the nose and mouth, have stunned many people to see the same heart with their companions, and they are filled with anger and preparations. Pull the knife to face each other. It’s not because these thieves have been obscured and inconspicuous, thinking that this group of people is a docile lamb. It’s just because of the cruelty of Hilika and the mysterious power of the man. This group of people is the most violent of Erasi. The blood of the most dangerous criminals of the thugs is the blood of murder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this scene is nothing in front of the Helicika that came to the news. He crushed the heads of the four thieves like a ripe tomato and then rubbed his hands on the corpse and stared at the thieves around him with a tone that was ten times bigger than their anger. "You want a woman." When the matter is over, you can get whatever you want but now it is time to do things. I can't tell the difference. In the current chaos, I promise that he will not even have a chance to see a woman in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the journey since the Greek card was spoken was calm and smooth. The two groups of people finally separated before they came to the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilika handed the map and a scroll to the man named Sandefes, the deepest forest drawn by the thieves who escaped last time. The terrain is also part of the appearance of the elves. And that scroll is used to crack the enchantment of the elves in the forest of Tula. Follow Hilika's plan. The men will lead the elites of Hilton Jessica Druid Anderson and the soul magician Bill, who first sneak into the dwellers' homes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you bring this scroll, you can hide the breath within a hundred meters so that it is not perceived by the detective magic shrouded in the forest. And when you arrive Before the enchantment of the elves, you can use the scrolls to sneak into the sky and sneak into it." Aisisi explained the plan to several people. "It is expected that when you sneak into it, we will sway in and attract the attention of the elves. At this time you can act. Remember that your task is to find a leaf as much as possible..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aisisi tried to put his hand and said: "You listen to me. It is not an ordinary leaf. It should be the sacred object guarded by the elves. And that thing you will know at a glance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know at a glance? What do you mean?" Bill's old man squinted and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, I know it at a glance..." Ai Xi answered with some lack of confidence. He had never seen this thing. He was only a respected client. It is only in such a clear and repetitive way that he can't be described. He quickly added a tone and said: "Reassured. There are more than two hundred of us who are bait for you. Are you worried that there is no chance? Just grasp the elf and ask for it. As long as you get the thing, the elves are sure. There will be chaos. This is a great opportunity for us to match the two reels..." Ai Xisi’s laughter seems to have been riding on a fairy girl. "We must take the opportunity to take down the entire city of Tula."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I always feel that I am not sure... so I can take Tula Leone Next?" I don't know if it is peculiarly cautious and intuitive. Bill's old man suddenly hesitated a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are four hundred of Elazia's best criminals to be your backing for you to be a bait." Aisisi almost jumped and shouted. "Do you have anything to worry about? I have three reels here and the one who gave me the reel of our reel. But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika Suddenly, there was a suffocating suffocation from the throat that seemed to be hungry than the behemoth of the behemoth. Aisisi’s voice and movement suddenly became stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces of several other people are suddenly ugly. Entering Tula Leone is not going to the outing to learn that these should be companions, and there are still secrets that you don’t want to let yourself know. Remuneration is tempting but much worse than life safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere suddenly froze in the air, only the more and more heavy breathing of Helicia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it. What the hell is going on, I don't want to pursue it..." Or the man named Sandefies spoke with a calm tone and confidence. The words completely reveal the master's style. "I just need to know that you will pay us the promised rewards afterwards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is natural. It is natural." Aisi Siru Woodpeckers nod their heads for food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay. Let's go." The man waved to the Hilton and walked to the depths of the forest. The rest of the people seemed to be infected. Follow him behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait." Helicia suddenly spoke. The man and the others turned and looked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for trusting you and you can go with confidence." Heli went to the door and fanned as if the two lips were completely spit out and he was incompatible with him. Although the sound is still the same as the stench of carnivores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to thank each other for each other." The man also faintly threw back to Hilika and led a man to walk deep into the forest and soon disappeared. Into the depths of the forest can not be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika still stood there with his hands on his chest. Aisisi and the four hundred thieves in the back did not dare to move. After a long time, I determined that the first few people had already entered the depths of the forest and would not come out again. Helicia turned and whispered to Aisisi and his men: "Let's go."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good attention to me." Ai Sisi shouted at all the thieves. He took out a magic scroll from his arms. It is exactly the same as the one that was handed over to the man. "When I walk into the forest, must I hear it within 100 meters of me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika just took out a map and looked at it. Then said: "Twenty miles east and then south. It is the closest place to the elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss. You see this really Can you do it?" Aisisi suddenly asked Hilika quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika replied faintly: "There are some people who do not worry about being a bait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I am not saying this. I am in case... If the guy died under the siege of the elves, the number of elves in it was too much for us to predict that we couldn't take it in Tula, and we couldn't get that thing... The voice of Aisi was suddenly scared. "What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
