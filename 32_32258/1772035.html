			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa woke up with her neck and now lay on a pile of moldy grass. A mouse quickly jumped from his foot into the gap in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head can be seen on all three sides of the wall are large pieces of blue stone only from the wall two vents slightly larger than the fist leaking some dim light. On the other side is a wooden fence with thick arms and a few wooden fences outside. This is a cold dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s House, which was just now in the palatial time, is now lying in a cell in a dungeon. The major contrast made Asa still dizzy in the head for a while. He shook his head and thought about it for a while but it was even more confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it that the Cavaliers suspected that there was something wrong with him and his fiancee? Still thought that he heard the injury of his fiancee is harmful? Asa carefully carefully filtered the words of his own report and there was no loophole. On the way to Wangdu, he handled the story about the swamp. Is that the Cavaliers' own proposition? Then only the face and the Duke adults said it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa suddenly heard the strange sound in a cell next to him. It is a breath of a man and a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the dungeon was kicked open without waiting for him to react. A jailed-dressed thin man rushed in and rushed to the door of a jail cello and kicked the wooden fence above him: "Get out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ground slammed a few times and then a fatter jailer walked out with his pants slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin jailer shouted: "What is going on with you? Not saying that I am coming first?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat jailer still stunned and screamed slowly and replied: "Who told you to come so late, you haven’t come to me for the shift time."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin jailer is still high: "Go to your mother's flat time did not see you so carefully waiting for Laozi to come a few minutes late, you have to complain for a long time now you are not anxious to go back I am here to enjoy the Laozi. Why should I ask you to help you with the shabu-shabu?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man still said without hesitation: "Forget it, since I have already done it and it’s useless. If you don’t do it, you will either wait for her to let go and go.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thinner the violent jump: "Go to your mother." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa approached the wooden fence and said to the two jailers outside, "I want to see Mullah." I thought about how to explain this to the Duke. Br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See your mom's xx! "The thin man slammed his body and flew up to the chest of Asa, who was completely unprepared in the middle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of broken bones was very clear in the quiet dungeons." The still fragile chest ribs were kicked off the chest and suffocated. Asa turned back and the back of the brain was hitting a protruding stone under the straw. The black fainted.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two jailers heard the crisp voice and saw that the prisoner was motionless after falling to the ground. The fat man hurriedly opened the fence and looked at Asa to explore the nose. : "It's bad!" "I touched my chest again." The ribs broke several times. It seems that even the heartbeat is gone. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skin is also secretly surprised by the power of this foot but forced to calm down: "Fright bird!" What is the fuss about a dead prisoner? I was famous when you said that Laozi’s hard work was very good when he was a soldier. You go ask the year "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man looked at the sound of the thin man in horror and said: "This prisoner is the spies that the Duke’s office just sent and said that it is well guarded. It was the Baron Krauss who personally seized that he might come to the trial. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skin is still intoxicated in the braveness of the kicking of the dead: "Afraid of a bird." "It seems that even if the baron came alone, he would kick a kick. But a little bit of a heart is also playing drums. After all, the recent pagans and spies have made a very fierce murder, killing a traitor, and being suspected of being a spy." The suspicion of murder and the baron's sternness is notorious. The voice of the thin man is small: "Wait for Laozi to think about it"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Escape?" The knight's face is more blue than the bluestone on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two jailers screamed in the dying voice of the head and neck: "He said that he was seriously injured and asked us to find him a doctor. This is you. The important prisoner we caught, we are afraid that he is really dead, go in and see where he knows that he suddenly stunned and we ran." To prove that he is doing his duty and pointing to other prisons, "You ask other prisoners, they all see it with their own eyes." The whole dungeon sounded a testimony of a dead and alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauvis’s eyes burst into a glimpse of killing people’s lives, staring at the two jailers and throwing a sentence: “You are not allowed here. Wait for me to come back." Turned and flew out of the dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the footsteps disappeared for a while, the thin man took a breath and expressed dissatisfaction with a very disdainful tone: "What stinks the shelf is not by birth." If Laozi was born in the Elni family, he would become a general at this age." Watching the fat man still trembled and feared that the heroic spirit in the center of the knight’s eyes was resurrected. Pat on the shoulder of the fat man and said: "How? You also said that you have to deal with the body yourself. It takes time and is easy to be directly given to the old man." He helped us solve the problem much faster. If you just started, you can't catch up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is still not even clear in his voice: "His eyes are so scary."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slimming mouth said: "I told you earlier that these sons and sons like to put on the shelf just to take advantage of the power of the home is the shelf scary. If it is a flat-headed old man, only one The foot kicked to death. The fat man echoed with his voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people who stood still and listened attentively did not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not been too long, even if the legs of the two haven’t been sore. Krauss has already arranged the arrest of the Wang’s Guards and returned to prison. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who did the prisoner talk to here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looks like no" thin man Dare to face the sight of Clovis and look at the wall behind him. The fat man is only staring at the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good-like?" Clovis' voice sounded like asking and talking to himself. The two jailers did not dare to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Clavis seemed to have figured out what the problem had decided to slowly nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No one can make mistakes, even if you make mistakes, try to make up for it. It’s useless to regret it. Are you saying that?" The Cavaliers' face is not so ugly. It is no longer the kind of horrible cyan. There is even a warmth in the eyes. It seems to be forgiving to comfort them. This made them feel relieved and hurriedly replied: "Yes, yeah, we must try to make up for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's right for you." Crowvis put his hands Putting on the shoulders of two jailers, the two were completely flattered. The fat man is not afraid at all. I feel that this handsome young aristocrat is worthy of respect than the statue in the church. The thin man also admitted from the bottom of his heart that this rich family probably did have a little higher than himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Pong’. A muffled sound echoed in the air of the dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One fat and thin two bodies squatting down like a good relationship, blood and brain are mixed together and can not be separated from each other. There are a few exclamations in the fences that are relatively close to the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers knighted his eyebrows with awe-inspiring screams in his slow, steady tone, like a resentful scream: " What are you talking about? They are just taking responsibility for themselves. You are also responsible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the Duke of the Duke, Mulak knows that the prisoner has no big escape The change in expression only calmly told the prisoner to bring him the belongings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers knight looked at the Duke’s calm, watery gods to the heartfelt admiration. This is a person who never knows what he is thinking, and the eyes that look up and smile are like seeing the secrets of the deepest heart of anyone. This is what Kravis wants to try to learn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
