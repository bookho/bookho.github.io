Bishop Adela replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope looks around. The dozens of crystal balls around the hall that originally reflected the wilderness of the highlands have all been extinguished. Without the commander of the magician, the eagle eye could not move for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Private emergency?" The Pope was stunned and wondered if he was somewhat upset because of this extraordinary period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He understands the energy that this half belongs to the lower half of the ally. Although he seems to be single, there is no huge force, but he can do more than absolute. Any force is big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially now that the relationship with the ally has become very subtle time needs to cooperate with him, of course, more need for his defense even if this defense It seems to be a bit too much but still necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let him come back as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But now, I don’t know where he is now. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you don't know, you can find a way to find out that you must have a solution. Is it right?" After teaching, I saw Adela's bishop and then again. Look at those crystal balls and say lightly. "You reminded him that Bishop Javie had recently had physical discomfort and could not eat. We were all helpless and might need him to look at it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But sir...I am really Not very clear..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, maybe it won't take long for him to finish the urgent matter. He should know that the body is like Bishop Javey. It won't last much time." The Pope said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that we can't wait for much time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal ball in the streets of Oufu The orcs that are running all over can't transmit the sound, but just seeing the scene can also feel the orc's murderous screaming deafening. The team's fully armed werewolves and ogres are gathering armor on them. The huge weapons in the hands reflect the incomparable light in the sun, and all of them can turn ordinary people into horrible weapons of meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are half orcs who are driving huge bulls. The wolves are flying in the air and flying the dragons. These animals are also excited and screaming in the murderous and scent of the air. The entire Oufu is like a huge bomb that is about to explode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such an atmosphere. Of course, there won't be any attention to the little birds that are hidden in the shadows of the eaves of the tall buildings. These little animals are also like dead, just moving silently and looking at everything outside with lifeless eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, Mr. Sedros’s willingness to live is temporarily impossible. At least, now I can’t tell them that they have eagle eyes and peep at them... let you break. Your principle has always been. I am really sorry. But they will not be able to use it for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The principle of breaking now is enough. I originally decided not to kill people.” Ai’s mother-in-law also looked at the crystal ball faintly. Although she always looked calm, she already had something in her vision that was not the same as before. "So this time you'd better pray that everything is going well. I can feel that I feel a little out of order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that your mood is not good but the most It takes a day or two for our lovely orc friends to come out...just that is basically my limit. Now the environment I have disappeared for too long, Magnus will not be very happy...but as long as Oufu starts There is basically no big problem in the action of Leicester. I will guarantee that everything that goes well there is the problem of the sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Give me a Celest's delivery reel." Aier's mother said suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, no." Because Hamm shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not negotiating with you now." Before the voice of Ai's mother-in-law was cold, it was only cold, and now it has become a knife-like chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't like being led by the nose and my patience with you has gradually approached my bottom line..." Ai's mother-in-law looked at the eyes of Bishop Hamm's eyes becoming sharper and sharper like red. "You have to believe that I have at least one hundred ways to make you die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also have to believe that this is not good for anyone." Inham Looking at Ai's mother-in-law, his eyes are not sharp and there is no power, but no matter how strong Ai's mother-in-law is, then he is as strong as a bottomless deep valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men looked at each other like this, because Ham finally took out a scroll from his arms. "Celebrity's scroll I can't give you, but there's another one here that might be just as useful for you. You don't have to say that I'm holding you down, but everyone is not for yourself, but it doesn't account for your own life." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glory Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you finally coming back? How did the private affairs be handled?" The Pope looked at the recently returned Bishop Hamm and asked with a slight sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for your concern, you have almost done it." Inham nodded to the Pope. "I can prepare to start the eagle eye..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no need to panic for a while. The body of Bishop Jiawei is not good, you should go see it first. Look, but with your care, I will definitely get better soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, my mother...I have one thing I hope I can promise. "Oh? You talk about it." The Pope had some accidents because Hamm had never asked him anything to ask for anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wreckage of the two Knights of the Necromancer... I hope you can give it to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You want that? What?" The Pope gave a glimpse. These two monsters created by the most intensive Necromancer are indeed magical works of art but in their own hands and in the meaning of the Necromancer are completely different. He had to think carefully about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My friend is very interested in magic research in this area. He promised that if I give him, he will find a way to heal my son's injury, although it is impossible to take him. Healed, but at least it is better than now. So please take down the two Necromancers and give me such a great grace. I must remember it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;" Needless to say, you will take it. I hope your friend can really cure Bishop Javey and I am looking forward to seeing him again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come." The Pope nodded. The person he has been wary of is actually swearing and pleading for relief. This makes him somewhat reassured. This seems to indicate that the other person’s heart seems to have already agreed with the position under him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that now is the time when you need him the most. Just take this period smoothly and plan to go smoothly... This kind of danger<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The character does not have to live in the world. When the plan was implemented, it was not far away. When he was so short, he couldn’t play any tricks. Jia Wei’s injuries have also seen that no one in the world can treat such injuries well. It is a miracle that he can stand up and only let him wake up halfway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basement of the sacred and magnificent Glorious Castle is so clean, dry and bright as a mid-range hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javi is lying on a soft bed in the basement. He has been lying for a long time and may spend the rest of his life lying on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strictness of his body is not a wound but Sandru’s use of Necromancer magic to distort all the vitality of his body. A dead knot. His bones and muscles have been in some parts of each other. The blood vessels and nerves are completely reversed. The liver is involved in the function of breathing. The lungs can digest food. This knot is also self-circulating and does not really die home. Even all his consciousness and mental power were twisted into a mass by the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can say that he is dead but no one is sure whether he is still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a gift for those who were killed by him and those who were killed by you." This is a line that Sandru left on his back. word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
