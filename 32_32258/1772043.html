			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru pushes the female corpse out of the big cloth that pulled out a corpse from below and shook a few times and dusted it to Asa and said, "How is this dress?" It’s worth it for another six months.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a look at this is a very old cloak. "Half-year? You are not going to be a robber. It is really a loss of the 6th thief." Asa shook his head. Look at this thick, smelly, heavy, dusty cloth. All of the above are solidified and traces of blood and other liquids that have been combined with the material of the cloth for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru’s eyes said: "This is the memory of the baby I collected when I was young."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the big house was suddenly knocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rhythmic three-click knocking shows the self-cultivation and temperament of the knocker. The lightness of the lightness is just enough for the people inside to hear it without any disturbing taste. Even if the owner is no longer sensitive, then he will never feel abrupt to such a visit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure to know where this is when you come here. And against the body of the full house, there is also an old man who manipulates the body and a disabled person who helps to play with the body. Who would knock the door in such a graceful manner as a courteous visit to an elegant hermit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru also wants to see who is polite to open the door by himself. Asa quickly put on the mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened a very handsome middle-aged gentleman standing outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A well-rounded middle-aged man’s peculiar shape of the blessing of the body is filled with a very gorgeous sword that looks more like an ornament. A set of dresses that are very suitable for him. A top hat with a neatly groomed eyes and a gentle and courteous smile. This is indeed a gentleman who will knock on the door politely no matter what kind of door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentleman owes a very graceful demeanor to Sandru: "Is you Mr. Andrew?" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. I am." Sandro seems to be afraid that someone will suddenly come out and rush to answer this title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the Duke of Mulak." This fat and amiable gentleman introduced himself. "Can you let me in? I am looking for someone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can please enter, please." Sandru is like a hospitable host. Very enthusiastic and generous to make a gesture of invitation to the Duke into the big house and pointed to the full body of the body and organs. "There are a lot of people here who don't know who the Duke wants to find?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am looking for him." The duke's smiling eyes have been falling since the door. Just put the corpse on his body, Asa. Take your hand and walk slowly toward Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa took a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t know why he will take a step back. This very polite and graceful gentleman is very attractive and he heard that he was born with the urge to explain the enquiry when he was the Duke. But I don't know why he didn't consciously take a step back when he saw the Duke coming toward him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it only takes a step back and doesn't move. The Duke slowly walked up to him. He looked at the duke who was half a head shorter than himself. He did not have a hunchback or a scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should have been installed for the past two months and he has developed the habit of automatically bending over and kneeling once in front of people. Only when he and the duke's eyes met, all his attention was drawn to the past and completely forgot to maintain his posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Asa immediately felt that he did not forget to maintain his posture, but the body himself unconsciously transformed into a posture of full-spirited alert. He is like a beast that smells dangerous and the whole body muscles have entered a highly sensitive state of one touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His spirit also entered the empty state of practice meditation in these two months. Every single pulsation of the body muscles is felt in the flow of every air around the skin in its own grasp. He can even feel that the magical power and spirit are constantly condensing in the body and can burst out at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retreat is the limit. The beast pursues the boundaries of the prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as he moves a little more, this seemingly amiable Duke will immediately kill him with the leopard's rapidity and the lion's fierceness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s eyes were pierced into Asa’s eyes and then went straight to every detail of his body to show him everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s mouth raised a smile. There are a few points of appreciation for a bit of ridicule. Very calmly said: "This young man rescued my little daughter from several bad guys last night. I know that he saved my eldest daughter two months ago. I really want to thank him. But" The right hand was taken from behind. It seems that it is just a random, an action hand placed on the belt next to it is the gorgeous sword that is close to vulgarity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa simply couldn’t hear what the Duke was saying. All his spirits are in the right hand of the Duke and the sword next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no basis, but he does know that even if the gorgeous sword shell is just a charcoal, the hand that pulls it out next time can also I waved two paragraphs like a crisp radish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa's physical strength and magical power have all gathered together to mix spirit and fighting spirit to become a point that is about to explode. Even if there is only one in ten thousand chances, he will explode all his power before his head flies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave birth to the illusion of being chased in the lizard swamp and the killing has come to an end and he has nowhere to go. That kind of beastly fighting spirit and madness completely recovered in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not move his mood even peacefully and completely immersed in the empty realm of meditation but he could feel the wolf in the deepest part of the soul is revealing Sharp canine screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you like to kill me? Come and come, try it, let me kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile of the Duke’s mouth is deeper and the taunting in the approval is even more complete. The white, well-trimmed hand has slipped onto the hilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Heroes save the good and brave." Sandro suddenly said strangely next to him. I don't know when he stood behind the duke and still played with a few dead teeth. This is when his old habits are okay, he always has to pick up a few dead people in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa saw the Duke’s hand suddenly tightened the top of the blue ribs and looked at it but he felt that it was not killing but nervous. The rhythm of the Duke’s breathing suddenly became chaotic, and his gaze was dissipated and the sense of urgency disappeared. Asa even saw that there was a terrifying smell in the eyes of the Duke. It seems that a hunter who has been prepared by God to assassinate a beast suddenly gets a large piece of ice in his crotch when he is about to get up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several teeth made the sound of Caracalla in the hands of Sandru. Sandro’s hand is very old. A lot of wrinkles are so pale that you can't see a trace of blood vessels and hair. It is whiter than the face of the dead. Even the sounds of these teeth striking each other in his hands have this ominous paleness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression on the face of the Duke did not change at all. But that is no longer a smile or even an expression. It’s just that the face of the last moment has solidified. The muscles of the face are still the same. There is no emotion like it is a mechanical demonstration of what is a 'smiley face'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focal length of the Duke’s eyes is still on Asa’s face. But Asa felt that he didn't look at himself but was looking at Sandro who stood behind him. Watch with all your attention. Just like I saw the Duke just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it’s not just a step back, even if you jump on a Duke of Dance, there’s no reaction. Asa felt that she suddenly became a bystander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not move the Duke and did not move Sandru, in addition to his hands continue to play with teeth like a stone. The whole hall seems to have solidified and can't continue to flow for a while. Only a few teeth collide with each other to know that they are dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that for a century, the Duke took a long breath and regained his vitality and smiled and reappeared on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
