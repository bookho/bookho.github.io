			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My home." Aisisi looked at the mansions that had almost become ruins, crying, tears, and twists, and the five features wrinkled together like being tortured The goblin is as ugly. Although it is only one of the nests of the Shamuxi thieves group, but after all, it has been painstakingly managed for such a long time. And here is the place where the big squad of the squadron of the city of Elazia will be rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely faint as the thunder hoof came from the far side of the block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who used the sword squatted on the ground and listened to the ground carefully. He stood up and said to Helicika: "One hundred and twenty reloading knights." Thirty light knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Knights of the Kingdom may be raised by the Olympian dog." Helicha snorted and spit. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Sisi looked up and saw a lot of people on the street outside the courtyard of the mansion parked and watched. He turned back and said to Helicika: "Look Come here, you can't go, let's go from the tunnel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hooves are getting closer and closer to the thunderous sounds that make the ground vibrate slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait to dig up the corpse of the scorpion and peel off her armor." Silika's eyes widened and walked toward the rubble. But the man had already stepped open the masonry and pulled the horsewoman straight out. Although the horsewoman was covered in blood and pale as paper and was fainted, but anyone can see that she really did not die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this scorpion still dead?" Shelikh smirked and the light in her eyes brightened like two small lanterns but there was absolutely no lantern. It’s such a fierce and obscene light. "It seems that the armor is really good. The body of this nephew seems to be strong enough. Hehe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man puts the horsewoman on his shoulder and faces the land The mouth went cold and cold: "That's because I deliberately didn't have a heavy hand. I still have this woman useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika licked and then The light in his eyes suddenly brightened ten times. This man's tone is a natural light. It seems that this woman is already his private belongings. It seems that he is the boss here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika has not heard this tone for many years longer than the female knight. His look to the man's background. The two-handed sword on the hand was rekindled with a faint temper. He could even feel the feel of a sword that brought two men and women together into a meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man was stunned by a knife and looked at the vision of the Sick card and the glare of the strange knife on his hand. . He slowly asked: "What do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reloading the Knights’ hooves has come to the door of the mansion and the hot people rushed around. Drilling into the real estate, Aisisi screamed out and shouted: "Boss is going quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha..." Hilika’s eyes are like a knife. Carefully swept a few rounds back and forth on the man's body and finally stayed on the knife. He suddenly laughed. And it seems that I am very happy to laugh like a big baby. "I don't want to do anything. Hahahahahaha..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man frowned and Ai Sisi stayed. At this time, the Knights of the Kingdom, my golden armor finally appeared at the door of the mansion. It’s almost a stop and it’s going straight here. Ai Sisi immediately retracted the real estate man and ignored the Helicia to engage the female knight into the tunnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika stared at the man’s disappearing background and licked his lips and his red tongue almost reached his nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of the fastest-riding light-loaded knights in the ranks of the Knights of the Kingdom actually jumped into the mansion directly in the mansion’s grounds and wrecked as usual equestrian The subtlety is incredible. Under the control of the knight, the horse is almost as dexterous as a horse but a deer in the jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilika looked at the knights who rushed here and spit out the white and thick. It seems that people are rushing out of their mouths before they die. The two-handed sword that he turned into the mouth of the tunnel was hit hard on the stone walls on both sides of the tunnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tunnel was crashed and just took the fastest reloading knights out there. In the tunnel, the giant swords and the dull impact of the rock wall and the sound of collapse are constantly heard. After the completion of the Helica all the way, the passage was ruined all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man came out of the neat knights and then walked into the ruined mansion. He is very different from other knights. A light-skinned waist with a slanted long sword and even the look on his face is not as sinful as other people, but a sinister look. Still coughing twice from time to time. He looked at it carefully and frowned at the battle marks that almost removed the big mansion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the search, a knight came forward to report on this man-made blessing: "The generals who did not see the Shamuthi thieves group should have escaped the passage through the tunnel." There is no way to chase after it has collapsed. But we don’t have the relics of the great Talis. It was the same as the previous ones, she told us to come here to catch the captives.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Reporting General." A light knight captain who first rushed here came forward and reported. "I just saw it... I saw..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Ou Ling looked at the vast and strange blood on the ground and two or three of them were like mummies The corpse of the body slowly wrinkled more and more impatiently and said, "What do you see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seeing...the subordinates seem to look like the adult of Talis Being stunned by a thief on his shoulders, all the blood was taken away... but... just as if he saw it... maybe it was wrong..." The captain’s tone was not even confident. He has seen how the Knights of the Temple can annihilate other thieves’ gangs like the swordsmanship and magic of the thieves’ gangs, as well as the magical effect of the brilliance of the armor. Like the gods and gods, the heroic and incomparable figure makes him memorable. . Moreover, it is really impossible to infer that this is based on common sense. How can the elite Knight of Celeste be beaten and killed by a group of thieves who are arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ouling did not seem to notice this ambiguous report. His attention was concentrated on a lot of dirt. He bent down and rubbed his dirt with his fingers. Then he straightened up and asked the team leader: "What do you say? I didn't hear it clearly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a subordinate who seems to see...the adult she is... It seems to be wrong..." The captain's answer is more uncertain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Non-speaking." General Ou Ling replied with a sigh of relief. "How can the Knights of the Temple be defeated by the thieves in the district? Do you think that the elites cultivated in the Glorious Castle will be such a pustule?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, yes." Busy nodded. "Their must be wrong. It must be wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Talis is not here to chase the remnants of the Shamu Thieves. General O'Ling turned and went out and jumped on the horseback and coughed twice. Said faintly: "Let's go back and wait for her good news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain quickly asked: "Do we not assist in arresting? Just go out immediately. In the five-mile radius, search for those thieves who must not run."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Ou Ling gave him a glance and said, "Don’t be yourself. You should be able to see the temper of Talis, and she has investigated the clues but they all want us to go out and have to go alone. This shows that she has enough confidence. It is right to look at the confidence of a shrine knight. Her glory is disrespectful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." The captain nodded and nodded his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So we don't have to worry about it. Let's go." General O'Ling coughed and coughed and had a helpless expression on his face. "The famous Knights of the Temple will not let us down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dusk soon after. It is more than three miles away from the mansion. Helicika and Aisisi and the rest of the masters drilled the sewer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the farthest and safest exit. To be cautious, to prevent the kingdom of the Knights of the Kingdom from encircling the Helicia, let other thieves take the other few relatively dangerous. Export. But now it seems that there is nothing to mobilize the army to pursue them on a large scale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid has restored the human form and everyone has put on a set of looks that look ordinary. Even Hilika wore a dress that could cover up his fierce arrogance. I have to admit that the Shamuthi thieves can have such a scale and it is not a lucky one. In the huge basement, there are not only a few escape-only passages, but also a lot of things for escape. The unconscious female knight was loaded with a big pocket by the man on the shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
