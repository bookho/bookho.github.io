			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two-legged flying dragon flies across the mountains and rivers like a set of scenery that looks like a slow sweep from below. However, Asa knows that this seemingly slow is actually only the illusion of being too far away. Even the fastest one can not catch up with half of this giant reptile. And this is a straight line forward, as long as you can reach Oufu in a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wyvern from a light cloud smashed the silky cloud. The water vapor contained in the cloud is so high that it is a little bit faint on the face. If it is not wearing a strange eye mask on the face, Asa probably can't even open his eyes. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eye mask is a piece of leather inlaid with two pieces of glass on the head, after seeing through the glass piece and not being hurt by the wind. This thing is obviously made by the craftsmen of Oufu who are specially made for the guests who ride this strange flying beast. The general lizard driver does not need this kind of thing. The lizard has a transparent cornea on the eye. You don't need this weird prop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only a patent for lizards. Asa can be sure that there is absolutely no such organ in Gru, but he is more comfortable than the lizard. This high-altitude cold wind is like a knife. If it is a little delicate, the average person will probably be smashed by a layer of skin. But Gru is as calm as it is at the desk. He took a charcoal pen and put a piece of leather on his leather while observing the terrain below. The slender hands and the charcoal pens were swiftly swept in a hilly terrain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa remembers that it took a whole day to cross the complex hilly terrain when he first went to the west. Now sitting on the Wyvern is just over ten minutes and has already flown. Asa suddenly thought that if I take this thing to travel around the big 6 probably can't use it for a month. But that makes no sense. The road was originally used to go instead of flying over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think there are flies in this place." Gru suddenly smiled coldly. His eyebrows and eyes didn't move, but the lines on his lips changed into a cold-faced expression like a rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flies?" Asa looked around. Under the influence of the breath of the two-legged dragon, there is no one around the bird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably come to you." Gru took the drawn map into his arms and looked coldly down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked at his sight and finally saw five small black spots approaching here. Just looking at the shape and size also knows that this will never be the fly. The open wings seem a bit like a bat. But absolutely no bats may fly to get this height. Asa suddenly woke up and almost jumped from the back of the Wyvern: "It's the Necromancer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five little black spots are approaching here. The shape has become more and more clear. A mouse-like face like a monkey, but a huge hundredfold behind the body with a pair of huge wings. It is the kind of gargoyle that I have seen outside the whisper of the whisper. And you can see three people sitting on top of each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?" Asa’s forehead was a little sweaty. "Crashing down the ground?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three Necromancers can't just ride a gargoyle in the sky to pass by here. In the face of their high-level magician, especially the Necromancer, the Big Six, the most powerful air tyrant, and a chicken are no different. And if it is deliberately directed at him, then he will never be afraid of him. After all, the two-legged dragon is strong, and after all, it is a living monster that is less powerful than a stone-like ghost driven monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to the ground to do what? Fly over." Gru replied coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where to fly?" Asa took a reins and replied. Because the force is too strong, the two-legged dragons swelled their wings and encouraged them even harder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru is frowning. Got up and took the reins of Asa's hand. However, he did not continue to urge the two-legged flying dragon to fly forward, but a twisted reins, the two-legged dragons reflexed toward the gargoyles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" Asa was shocked and stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go and see what they want to do." Grum replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I see that we are still going to find a place to hide better." Although Asa is also very convinced of Gru's combat power, but this is after all A few kilometers high is not the 6 places that can be freely galloped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed and looked at the five gargoyles who were getting closer. In this case, it seems that only the machine is acting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five gargoyles quickly approached. The silver masks of the three Necromancers above are shining in the high sunlight. They did not go too far to the Wyvern, but stopped at a distance of twenty or thirty meters to form a fan shape. The three Necromancers were scattered in three directions to look at the two on the Wyvern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong? Why don't you escape?" asked a Necromancer on the left. Although the sound is ugly because the props in the mouth have changed, the surprise taste can still be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because we don't want to escape." Gru faintly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So are you coming to surrender to us?" A necromancer on the right nodded and grinned. "It seems that your judgment is really good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing?" Asa asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nature is to kill. Kill you since you are with him. Then stop him with him. So you are still running away." The Necromancer opened his mouth. This should be an old man, but with a mask on his face, he still shows his curly white and wrinkled dark skin on his mouth. His voice seems a bit violent. "Whether you are surrendering yourself because of your knowledge of the time, or if you want to talk to us about what conditions are in place. We don't accept it. You only have one way to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gru smiled. This originally nice smile is mixed with the light in the eyes. Asa felt that she saw a leopard that opened her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am really sorry. Teacher Nimbas is not in a good mood. Because he bet he lost." A Necromancer smiled and pointed at Asa A bit. "He originally thought that you should have been away from the king. But our agent president will gamble that you will definitely go to the ducal palace. He said that you will definitely go to see the beautiful princess before you go. We only need to wait for the rabbit." Sure enough, he was expected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think your guild president knows me so well." Asa smiled unnaturally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it the sage of the Tatalia, Nimbath?" Gru looked at the Necromancer in the middle. "I don't think you will be the person of the Necromancer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since we call the name in front of us, they really didn't intend to stay in our mouth." "Asa sighed. The position of the sage Nimbath in Tatalia is like the position of Bishop Ronis in the Ian Fast Empire. Even the king has to consult the highly respected sage in many places. I don't know how the people of Tetaglia will know what the people they admire are actually a Necromancer. "But since you have made up your mind to make us die, why should we wear that mask? Let us see if we can understand it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry This is the guild rule."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be afraid. Although we will kill you, but you die, you still have a choice." The necromancer who likes to laugh I chuckled again. I said to Asa in a soft and affectionate manner with the child's mouth. "As long as you tell us the whereabouts of the leaves of the world tree, so that we can find more effort and effort. Then we can make you die easily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I don't tell you that the fall of the leaves of the world tree is not at least a life can be saved?" Asa replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't tell us that we will naturally look for it. As long as this thing is still on the Big 6, it is impossible to escape our grasp." The Necromancer sighed. Persuaded Asa with a very serious and full of goodwill. "I advise you to tell us. Each of our members is a busy person with countless major issues to deal with leisure time and there are many noble and elegant entertainment and artistic life. You tell us to save us the precious We will naturally repay you in time. Without pain, you may not even feel the concept of 'death' and return to the eternal and peaceful country of death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nimbasi shook his head and said, "You don't have to escape. We have come to three people. It is expected that you will definitely resist or escape. I have not experienced the excitement of the hunters for many years." He paused. I used half the alms to give half the motivation to say: "Maybe you are lucky enough to escape. It is also very boring if you lose your fighting spirit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Asa said while watching the mental state of the three Necromancer's breathing eyes. As long as there is a slight bit of flaws, he will be ready to shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s a pity. He has never found such an opportunity. Three necromancers in three directions. No matter how proud they are, the three gargoyles that have been riding in the ocean have been keeping distances of tens of meters from the two-legged dragon. This distance of several kilometers above the altitude is enough to prevent any sudden melee attacks. And they are in the middle of each other to form an equilateral triangle. The distance between the three people is exactly equal. No matter which one is attacked, the other two can react and rescue in the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint magical fluctuations in the three Necromancers are constantly flowing in the triangle. Although they are proud, they are not forgetting. Each of them is a clever and outstanding character who will never make a low-level mistake that neglects because of the advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Asa is not desperate and even hopes that the person behind should not let himself down. He must have a chance even if he can't find a shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong. You are going to escape." Nimbas seemed a little impatient. There was a dark green wave of light on his hand that was a death ripple that was one of the high-level necromancers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic has no destructive effect on objects but the fluctuations that imply death and chaos are fatal to creatures. And this is a sense that range magic has almost no dodge. Even if the Wyvern is swept by this magic, it will lose half life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said. We never thought about fleeing from the beginning. And I want to ask you a question." Gru’s vision is in three dead spirits. The mage swept a word and said: "Why don't you escape yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha..." "Oh..." Three Necromancers I laughed. Nimbasi smiled especially happy. The green light in his hand slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the next moment, like the shining star of the meteor, the light suddenly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the disappearance of Nimbas’s hand. Originally, this magical control preparation resonance has been properly prepared as a group of smoke in your hand, as long as the hand and one of the simplest movements will immediately burst out. But even the simplest movement, he couldn't have time to do his hand and the magical power on it was scattered like a pile of shredded paper in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foot of the dragon's huge body down to the place where the Shenrug just stood has been completely recessed while the muffled sound of the two ribs broke out from the body of the dragon . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nimbus’s screams are no less than the Wyvern. Their screams also sounded at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru, who was still standing still on the Wyvern in the last moment, is now standing in front of Nimbus, the gargoyle. He was at the foot of the gargoyle where he had fallen. Gru also extended his hand as he stood on the gargoyle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same hand has a layer of light on his hand and Nimbus, but it is white. The hand that he used this white light seemed to just reach out and take a shot of Nimbas, the hand that was full of magical green light, and it flew into a piece of meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Gru also has a white brilliance of countless tiny colorful spots on his body. Countless small spots melted into his body with only one contact, and he immediately got a meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This one lasted only a blink of an eye. But only by this moment of stagnation Nimbas has screamed back and jumped off the gargoyle. The other hand that could have made his head smashed and smashed just took a bloody flower from his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only one that was determined to be defeated was actually lost and actually turned into a magical Gru to turn to the Necromancer on another gargoyle. He has white brilliance on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer is shocked. He saw the boiling violent killing and fighting spirit in the dark scorpion. For the first time in his life, he felt fear of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has been laughing all the time and always thinks that the winner is in the grip, but he can see that this person should be very good and understand that he will definitely shoot more clearly since the other party has Confidence must have a confident capital. So his proud laughter also condenses a magic ready to release. He is willing to wait for this person to shoot and guess that he must jump above the gargoyle. He waited to see that the man became stiff in midair and then fell from the height of the kilometer into a muddy state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a sham and a sneak attack. It is a real strength. This Necromancer knows that it is meaningless if this person is rushing to his own God-alert. It may be that even the concept of 'death' is too late to produce a head and is broken like Nimbas’s hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, in front of this person, he is actually no different from a bug. This unprecedented fear swept all his nerves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top white magic paralysis that can make an elephant stiff for half an hour is only a short-sighted delay. If it is a battle between two powerful opponents, this may be a fatal opportunity. But the three of them are but magicians. Even the reaction of the top magician's body is not too different from the average person. This moment is too short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Necromancer has no more use of attacking magic. His confidence has disappeared in an instant. Fear and urgency let him subconsciously cast a high-level white body magic ‘Tianzhiyou’ with full force. Under the almost top level of white magic, he has dozens of auxiliary spells like ‘Strength Technique’, 'Blessing', 'Lucky Art', 'Invigorating', 'Stone Skin'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru bends and jumps at the foot of the gargoyle's huge body is instantly split. His figure was transformed into a straight line with a white light in the eyes of the Necromancer who had blessed the eagle eye, and shot like the arrowhead to the gargoyle where the Necromancer was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Tian Zhiyou’ really saved the life of this Necromancer. ‘Eagle Eyes’ allowed him to see the postures that Gru had to bend over and ‘quickly’ and ‘power’ to give him enough reaction and strength to escape. He had no time to manipulate the gargoyle. He also jumped hurriedly like Nimbas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a crack in the gargoyle behind it. The Necromancer made a gesture in the air and mourned the mantra and used the flying technique to fly away. When he turned around, he saw that the man was standing on a gargoyle and punched. After the loud bang, the magical creatures with his body dozens of times were broken into a pile of rotten stones and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only remaining gargoyle escaped under the control of the Necromancer and flew here to catch the Nepal that fell to the ground. Mbas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru jumped back from the corpus of the gargoyle to the two-legged dragon and nodded to Asa: "Good job."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Gru was moved, the first reaction was Asa. He immediately began to condense the magical power of the two-legged dragon screaming and he immediately used a high-level treatment. Otherwise, the two-legged dragon that has broken a rib at the root of the wing will immediately plant it toward the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Nembas’s hand was broken by the Necromancer’s numbness, another Necromancer was about to shoot but Asa’s three fireballs It has already arrived in front of him. Necromancer had to smash the fireball with three lightning bolts. It’s just that the moment of delay in this paralysis has lost. Seeing Gruner's body-like necromancer, which couldn't be captured with his eyes like an arrow, couldn't dare to rush to drive the gargoyle down and catch the falling Nimbas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The necromancer flying in the air also fell to the gargoyle. The three frightened necromancers are now gathered on the only gargoyle. In this short breath, their emotions fell from the paradise to the reality and fell into pain. Like a scholarly scholar, the world’s scholars suddenly face a ferocious beast. The things that they rely on for pride are as pale as a joke. No matter how magical and intelligent skills are like waste under the most savage and most direct degree and power of the original. For the first time, they felt that they were as weak as ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lips under the mask of the Necromancer are shaking slightly. Whether it is because of anger, pain and fear, it is not just the four gargoyles that are destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fearing the horror of shame and the incomparable pain became hysterical anger. Nimbas took his own hand and stared at the twins and screamed: "Kill him and kill him. I want to kill him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Although his appearance seems to be crazy, but this is not crazy. After all, the three of them are the top 6 magicians. As long as they have opened up the distance, there is enough preparation advantage to stay here. After all, as long as you can use the body of the big mantra, you can't compete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they are too late to have any preparations for the two-legged dragons, and they have slammed into the gargoyles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like the one with the same white light, the singer from the two-legged dragon rushed to the gargoyle with the eye almost impossible to capture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a necromancer who has blessed ‘天之佑’ to see this faint figure. Although he still can't accurately grasp such a high opponent, but the distance is now far more than just now. He is already trying to improve his magic. The key to preparing is that he can see the direction of his opponent. But with such a quick degree, it is impossible for any mage to use a wide range of high-level magic. He uses both hands to pour all the magic that has been raised to the limit into a low-level spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange rupture sounds from the air and fills the air. Then the figure suddenly weakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Necromancer is disengaged. The face outside his mask was a pale coughing out a small piece of blood. He only felt as if the magical force that came back from the back was like a smashing of the internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic is low-level, but he used all his magic power to improve the effect. The Force Shield used to block the action of the arrows and the enemy was originally a dangerous low-level magic. If the force field breaks the magician's own magic, it must be disordered and even hurt. Although his full use of the 'force field shield' can block a boulder thrown by a trebuchet, but under the impact of this figure is fragile like a thin piece of paper. If it is not because of the gentle rebound of the white magic in the body, the magical rebound after the broken field can already kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the magic he used desperately did get the effect. Although Gru is still diving here, but after breaking through the force field, he has changed from the original white light and shadow to a person who can see clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is already in the air and has no way to borrow. The other two necromancers fell on him with a poisonous eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nimbas screamed and the green ripples rushed out on his only remaining hand. The dead green is as strong as he is holding a pool of stagnant water that has been rotted for thousands of years. This pool of stagnant water swelled in his hand and became a strong and seemingly shaped arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nimbabes raised his hand to the figure in midair. Even a powerful fighter who floats in the air without any borrowing is just a living target. The arrow of the Necromancer in his hand is the essence of his decades of magic. No one has no creature to withstand this blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A violent explosion suddenly exploded in the middle of Gru's body. The violent air currents and flames grew into a large group of death flowers in space, and even the stone ghosts began to shake under the impact of the air. The fire of the huge explosion immediately drowned the figure of Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three necromancers are jealous because they have not played. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the next moment the figure rushed out of the flame and restored the original high and continued to rush toward the three necromancers on the stone ghost. The violent magical energy did not make him shake the impact of the explosion but let him suddenly add. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white vindictive light on his body has reached its limit. He raised his hand and the slender five fingers bent and clenched his fists. Even in the explosion, the three Necromancers had the feeling of hearing roaring<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two-legged flying dragons on Asa took back their hands and took a breath. This fireball, which is faster than the arrow, also contains such a great power. If it wasn’t for these two days, I couldn’t use it when I studied it at the old man. Although he and Gru did not agree in advance, he also knew that this fireball is definitely the right choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nimbas has a terrified color on his face. Because of this sudden increase, he knows that the magic in his hand is absolutely fast but this punch. But he felt that the neckline suddenly tightened and suddenly began to hang back backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru’s feet finally set foot on the head of the gargoyle, the hard rock of the black rock began to crack. But the gargoyle is empty now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three Necromancers have already flown into the air. Or it should be said that only one Necromancer carries the other two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first Necromancer who was standing at the end of the game because he was forced to attack, and the Necromancer was not free. It also embodies the magic power. When the Gru one plus in the midst of the explosion, especially when he saw the raised fist, a subconscious fear could involuntarily turn the magical power that he originally intended to attack into a driving force for escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
