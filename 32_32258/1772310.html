			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't all of them belong to people who don't know how to be good? He just killed you." Talis took the sword and the crystal in her hand. I took it back. She now sees that Asa has actually treated the old man. But in that case, if Asa’s hand is not magic but vindictive, the old man can be rushed to break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what you are, you are a little girl. The most important thing about church idiots is judgment. He can't, he can't. He can kill me." I promise that you can't live too much." Shante glanced at Asa and sighed. "To tell the truth, I really didn't think you could be so fast, you can make me live. Real meditation you have already practiced? I have practiced for so many years, actually not as good as your hair boy."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But as you said, you can't kill you if you can make it." Asa replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can indeed kill this old man at any time. A magician is stronger. At this distance, it is not enough to catch up with a chicken. However, Asa also knows that as long as the old man dies, all the human organs in the house, the corpses, and perhaps the numerous buried bodies outside the corpse will immediately enter the corpse. Even if Asa can barely die, Talis and Ayimei can't afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This disease should be caused by the practice of meditation, forced practice without training, but only half-death. The magic skills of Mr. Shante are really superior. "Asa smiled and looked at the mountain on the bed." He knew the ills of this old man from Ai's mother, and it was almost impossible to cure. But at the same time, Asa's body practicing the real meditation also has the vitality of the world tree leaves. He is also The only person who can cure this problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you complimenting me or laughing at me?" Shant sat up straight and couldn't help but sigh. "This throat and lung have tortured me for more than 30 years. Many times I can't wait to take these two things out and throw them away. I almost have forgotten what it feels like. Even if you are not well-intentioned, I still have to Thank you." Suddenly, he added that I have also forgotten what the taste of people is, probably the last time was forty or fifty years ago? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old gentleman agreed with us....." Ayimei asked cautiously. The body of the whole house just lived. Scared that she is not light.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sant is still shaking his head, no hesitation: "No, this is the rule left by Akibad, this road only The acting president can only go, this is the place where the acting guild president who has become a real meditation can go. Although you have practiced real meditation, you are not the acting councillor, I can't let you go. Even I was the gimmick, I didn't allow her to pass. She walked the other way in the past. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what are you going to do to make us pass?" Let's open a condition. "Talis said coldly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without conditions, I will not let you go." Shant coughed softly again, and the topic returned to its original state.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or you killed me, you can pass." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa sighed deeply and stopped talking. From the arms, he took out the small pocket with the black handle of the black star. Pockets, turbid eyes brightened, and then more turbid. He did not speak. Asa untied the open bag and reached out to remove the hilt from the sun well water. Although the breath has converged under the effect of a good ring, But the whole house was suddenly completely covered by the peculiar darkness of the darkness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be an illusion, the limbs, organs, and corpses that have just been alive and kicking have this breath. The earth has regained its vitality. Although they still have not moved, they are making silent breaths and sputum.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talis feels all over the body Wrinkled a goose bump. Ai Mei curled up in her arms and shivered. Her body could not bear the breath.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not an agent The president, but I have this, can I pass it? "Asa took the hilt of the Dark Star, and his voice seemed to have changed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sant did not speak. His eyes were squatting, inside Things are mixed like beach sewage, and there are strange fluctuations flashing from time to time. It seems like a bubble in the depths of the memory. He sees very clearly that this person’s hands are not the slightest vindictive or magical. He took the hilt with the flesh. And this is a man who succeeded in practicing the real meditation. After a long silence, he said slowly: "You practiced as a real meditation, and you can play the sword of the black star. The handle, even if it is not the acting president of Diya Valley, is better than the acting president. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't need your surrender, as long as you give way," Asa said. His voice has become dull and distant, his eyes have completely dimmed, and there is no slight luster inside, just like the black mist emitted by the dark stars. He is desperately suppressing the growing sense of killing in the body, and the deep and profound killings like this breath are not aimed at the old man in front of him, but for all things, including Talis and Ayimei behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the kind of hostile killing, he is not hostile to anyone, anything, only killing, or dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If he doesn't let you go anyway, you pick up the blacksmith's hilt in front of him. That's for any <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer is an irresistible authority. But... unless there is really no way, it is best not to do this...." Aier is telling When Asa came here, he said this to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa does not really do it. He felt that the old man in front of him might be similar to Sander's. He couldn't be taller. Even at such a close distance, he already had an advantage and won't win more than half. The key is that Talis and Ai Mei is here, they can't afford the impact of the two hands. So he only used the last method that Aier's mother told him to tell him. What he didn't think was that the result of completely holding the hilt would be like this. Unlike the Ai's mother-in-law, they didn't just touch it, but they completely took the dark star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless breath of the hilt is constantly pouring into his consciousness. Responding to it is the desire, impulse, death desire and seed movement from the body, from the deepest point of consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death. go to hell. The result of birth is to die. Everything to survive is just to die, the end will be lost, the growth will be destroyed, no matter what is the end of the death, any life is accumulated by countless deaths, life is death, death is peace Death is rest is calm is the eternal cradle of eternal gestation. The ultimate vesting is the ultimate goal of all roads. Death is irresistible and no resistance. Resisting is pain. It is vain. Only acceptance is peace, and the right way is fate. ....."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even thinking has automatically emerged from this countless and dead thoughts about letting people die, the impulses in the body, the desires It is to die, that is, every cell, the most subtle feeling is automatically radiated from the source of the soul that has been hidden in the body. Now it is only inspired by this breath.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Street came down from the broken wooden bed and struggling to remove the wooden bed. There was a huge slate mountain below waving a mourning mourn, and the slate made a dull friction. Na opened, exposed below A dark passage. "Road here, you go. "Sant seems to be overpowering and coughing up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where to go? To die? The festival has not moved, but there is only such thought in mind. Ah, where are you going to die, tired, or die, everyone is going to die...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want to die, I don't want to die. I don't want to die....I don't want to die....I don't want to...This other instinctive voice is gradually drowning in the outside, the endless thoughts of death and death in the end.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sand coughed twice, looking at the still standing Asa, seeing the layer of black that gradually thickened in his eyes, and felt that he began to diffuse He is also a person who has practiced real meditation. He has accompanied the dark artifact for decades in Diya Valley. He feels and knows what is going on, so his wrinkles are a bit like The ugly face of the bat<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is showing a bitter smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark momentum is no longer from Scoop on the handle Come out, it has already begun to emerge from Asa, and it seems that because of his body, the breath is stronger and stronger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are rumors of turmoil in the house. There seems to be outside the house, and it is bigger. I don’t know if all the people have hallucinations at the same time. The corpses are cheering, cheering and jumping in this constant atmosphere. This is theirs. Breath "Do you do it? Go on the road. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden sound that broke the silence that was as hard as death. The voice was loud and loud, full of energy and emotions, like a lightning bolt. I opened this mouth with a breath of death that is so dying.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
