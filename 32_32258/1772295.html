			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned down in front of the grave, his face pressed down the ground, took a deep breath, the smell of the earth poured into the body, long time reluctant to disperse go with. This is the place where people here express their highest respect for the land of the deceased. Straight up, he looked at the grave in front of him and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slender hand stretched out and gently wiped the dirt off his face, Ai Meimei stood by and looked at him quietly, nothing Did not say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your father's? It looks like a very ordinary person." Talis looked at the grave and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, he was a very ordinary person. He has been in this basin for a lifetime, hitting iron, selling weapons, raising me, and then...dead.. "Asa faintly answered, his eyes are very confused. The eyelids are slightly moist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about your mother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, it's probably very ordinary." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems like she died before I was born."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is it possible, nonsense." Talis thought Asahu said, not sneer a little. "This ordinary person can raise a monster like you. The Lord in heaven is really... maybe it is a wrong hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am also very ordinary Yeah... at least I think I am far from my father, he is great, I am very selfish." Asa sighed and bent down to make himself the forehead of <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Placed on the tombstone, the warm skin feels the cold and rough stones, the cold, the gentleness of the rough, that is the greatest strength. He straightened up, put on a mask, turned and said faintly: "Go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three left the cemetery, Asa led Talis and Ayimei Going to the village. When the villagers met the villagers, the villagers were only curious about them and they didn’t have much interest. This year, the dwarves made a path to the wilderness of the northwestern end of the basin to facilitate the trafficking of ore and weapons, so apart from those bounty hunters, these outsiders are not uncommon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa has not spoken any more, and Talis does not speak. The three people walked silently on the small road in the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't remember what my mother looked like, even my father was just a vague impression." Ai Mei, who had never been open, suddenly whispered Say. "From my clear note, my brother is feeding me. He helps me find things for me to eat, go to the streets to beg. Help the thieves transfer their hands and help them to dig through the sewer vents and steal the goods. Many times he I also went to steal and cheat... He is not much bigger than me... until we were adopted by my grandfather... Grandpa is also, he was exiled from the church by the church, but he is not willing to go to the Chamber of Commerce. It’s all about raising us, we go to the chamber of commerce and follow the business... Finally...” Ai Meimei said very calmly. But the tears in the corners of the eyes are already rolling down. So I understand the feelings of the big brother of Asa..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am also responsible for the affairs of Abin. After I finished this matter, I must..." Asa sighed and looked at the original, very delicate and slender. These days, she was a girl who was so sturdy, a kind of rising from the deepest. The meaning of love and affection came to mind. He reached out to Ai Gege’s shoulder.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Talis’s hand took the lead and took the little girl to take her I got into my arms. The knight took a look at Asa’s hand in the air, and then pampered her face on Ayi Mei’s head and said, “I have promised your brother, I will Always protect your sister. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiled a bit, reluctantly shrugged and retracted his hand. The knight was a bit higher than Ai Meimei, and her hair was put up for the adventurer's cloak. In the hood, it looks like an extremely handsome young knight is kissing a poor girl. The taste of the illustrations in some knight novels.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai Meimei nodded, barely smiled and looked at Asa. "And Asa Brother will take care of me, I now have a sister and <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Asa brother's care, my brother knows in the sky will be happy. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa shrugged silently and suddenly remembered and asked Talis: "What about your parents? In Celeste?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I don't have parents. Talis answered with a blank expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What? Is your sister an orphan?" Ai Mei looked up and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horsewoman did not answer directly, just stunned, then smiled and said: "The knight who seeks truth and justice does not need the things of parents and relatives. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa looked at Talis's face and flashed a slight sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe recalling the stupidity of her previous performances of being knights because of her strong sense of justice, it seems to be now <br /> Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t think it’s ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who is obsessed with something in a certain way may actually prove that he has nothing in other aspects, and everyone needs <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catch these things in your heart. Poor people must have hateful things. In fact, there seems to be no pity for people who hate hateful people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai Mei said with a big eyes: "But now, is Talis sister not having my sister?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh. Protecting your sister is my most important task as a knight." Talis smiled and smiled very softly and warmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, let's go, two good sisters." Asa smiled and looked at the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You shouldn’t just come to see your father’s grave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not. I came back to find someone, I want to ask her about something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, do you still have friends here? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not a friend, it should be my first and most important teacher." Recalling this person, Asa could not help but smile. "Almost all of my most basic things were taught to me, and I did not inherit my father's craft and went out. It seems that there is also a <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason is because of her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I really want to see what kind of teacher you are, to be able to turn a very ordinary little blacksmith It became the current mess of the mainland<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a bad guy with a restless dog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to Talis In this case, Asa could not help but groan. However, he immediately said with a smile: "How is it possible. It should be its own reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three did not go long, they crossed the village and came to the village. I saw the lonely cottage. Very sophisticated cottage, although <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is very simple, but not rudimentary, and in many places you can feel strange and chic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ayr, is you there?" Asa stood outside the house and knocked on the door, although he now knows the cabin with his perception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one, but this is the habit he has developed over the past two decades, standing outside the door and shouting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mother-in-law is not at home, maybe outside the town, we come in and sit and wait for her." Asa pushed the door and went inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to talk about outsiders, even the local villagers have never passed, and according to the simple folk style of Hammonddale, never /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of someone's home will be locked up. The same is true of the cabin door, which is pushed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The furnishings in the house are still the same, and there seems to be no change between the two decades. In addition to some simple furniture and daily necessities,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
