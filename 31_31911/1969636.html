Seeing that his condition is wrong, everyone, including Anne, immediately turned around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic dust flies and dances as the magic changes. The beautiful but deadly rainbow tail flames flew to everyone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acid-ray, always calm Tis; Magnum also screamed out of control. She never imagined that the third-rate wizard sniper she hit, she would miss the hand to launch this magic. The captain sang a new spell in a hurry, trying to reverse the magic bullet, but could not find the right magic for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I stop the terrible magic? The person who was hit, there will be no bones in the body - follow its trajectory, the first one on the road happens to be a stunned necnik. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne is the first to react. She flew past and threw down to the sinica, which was on the shooting line, and the right hand prepared magic was launched. She was originally planning to use this high-level magic that only had a short time to block the other side's shots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reflect field!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hemispherical absolute defense field is surrounded by Her right hand unfolds, and the purple and yellow magic dust gathers around the deflection field, forming a visible refracting hood; the compressed air mass hits it and then slides away. Colorful magic dust mixed together, no one can see the ballistics at a time -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shield of honor (shieldglory)!" "resist energy )!" "Lucky bless!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrified casters blindly throw their strongest defenses or defensive magic. The effect of most magic is totally wrong, but Lieutenant Colonel Eugen made a judgment in an instant. He took out his collection "The Wall of Instantness" and left it underground, starting its magical effect. The stone wall that was originally intended to withstand the Freedom Army attack grew from the ground in the position of the defensive array, accompanied by the loud sounds and vibrations of the rumble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啪", with a soft click, the compressed air bomb did not touch anyone and safely hit the stone wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of people spit out the sigh of relief, only Anne’s face became iron. She took the sinica and threw it down, only to drop the sentence to the lieutenant colonel who chewed the gum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Globe! What are you doing this guy! Lying down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People only have one It’s amazing in an instant. Then, the continuous "beep" bursting sound finally let them react: the stone wall was all inflated -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-and implosion The effect of the technique extends down the stone wall into the underground array structure! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the ground uplift, like the water that is about to boil. Then, the magic dust rushed to the sky along the extended defensive squad, and the colorful detection of dust in the defensive magic of each person and the pure silver of the sky filled the impressionist three-dimensional picture. The final arrival is horrible like rain debris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hit point of implosion is the first to exceed the limit, cracking open, and then like the infectious disease, it extends wildly in both directions. Whether it is a stone wall, a pebble pavement or a loop circuit, it is flushed by compressed air, and then...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is an explosion that is enough to shock everyone around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One-tenth of the "Lenni Big Detection Network" that has invested more than 300 spellcasters for two years and cost more than three million pounds This disappeared into the sky of silver pure energy flames and gravel sandstorms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Create water."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Endure the pain caused by corrosion Finally, Naimen finally raised his right hand to the front and interrupted this basic magic intermittently. The water vapor in the air condenses, forming a clear stream that spills over his face. He used his left hand to rub the place where the acid ray burned, and the remaining acid on the finger touched the finger and had a slight tingling sensation. Reluctantly open your eyes, the left eye will penetrate into the bone as soon as it touches the air, and you can't see even a trace of light; the right eye's horizon is vague, but you can barely see it clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young officer who was very self-aware of his ordinary appearance laughed at himself and climbed up from the ground. Thain tried to say something to him, but the tympanic membrane in his ear screamed and he couldn’t hear anything. Looking down from the top of the wall along the wedge-shaped bevel, you can only see the smoke that does not fall and the green magic light that erupts from time to time. Resist the door along the circular staircase of the warning tower, a five-level flight, two falls, three times because the pace is too fast hit the wall, but he still does not stop. This pain is far too far from the acid in the left eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even on the wall three hundred meters away, he can feel the shock of the explosion, so how close is Anne and Janika? ? When I think of it, I feel that I can't stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After rushing out of the city gate, the first thing that catches the eye is the dust that covers the sky and the gravel and the earth. The paved concrete pavement has been completely submerged under gravel and floating soil, and it is also filled with a little bit of dark dust. The soldiers who followed him and Anne came to the cavalry platoons. All of them were spared. They all fell to the ground, and most of them were injured first and were knocked down by popping sounds. There are a few hapless eggs that are directly hit by gravel, and they are not living. They must be the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are all good fighters - the wrong is their commander. The heroicness of the soldiers is more reflective of the commander’s mistakes and incompetence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was subconscious and took a deep breath and walked into the smoke. The scene near the blast was gradually clear: a golden light - a magic sword that he was familiar with - drifted there, leaving a hill made of gravel in front of it. Followed by a deep groove, the edge is sharp and tidy, it is obviously the wild magic storm that erupted. Two different magics achieved the perfect protection against both physical and magical attacks, pushing Xiulan, Rasta and Olia behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recognized Rasta and tried to ask: "Sorry... Excuse me, have you seen Renee?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No response. After asking twice again, the resistance door reacted: the three people in front of them have been temporarily shocked by the terrible bang. He had to leave them and walk to the place where Jenny and Annie were standing. In his impression, the place where they stood was not too far away from here - although it was due to the relationship between the acid and the liquid, he did not see the scene at the time of the explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Self-suppressor? Seneca?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nervous emotions rush in the hearts of teenagers Start. Jenny is indeed a dual genius who can control both rationality and sensibility, arcaneism and magic. But she is not good at adapting to the situation, and rarely uses the small means of "preparatory magic" - of course, she can not use To help save the "instant" super magic skills. Anne's strength is not clear to him, but from the age point of view, no matter how rumored, it is impossible to be above the 黛nica. At most, there will be some rare super-magic techniques. If even the famous knights like Rasta have to use the special effect of the famous sword "honor" to block the two, how can the two young girls be unscathed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here." The voice of indifference is coming from the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorstep passed and saw a black man who was about the same age as him. I don’t know what means to escape. A huge explosion. When I saw the door coming, the man’s ice-cold eyes stayed on his face, a little surprised, and then unnaturally removed, pointing his finger to the road in front of the door: “Be careful.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue uniform of the military uniform stayed in the footsteps and found that the front was actually a narrower than the two arms, and the black scorpion did not bottom out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the opposite of the trench, his former comrades-in-arms, the horse-riding infantry were also underground, and the position they stood was still some distance away. . Lieutenant Colonel Eugen and Major Cousin were all scratched in the ground and unconscious. Itis had a sigh of gasping for a while, and it seemed that the magic was almost exhausted. Her hand was lying on the side of the state secretary, Chase, who was still under the influence of paralysis, and the light from the captain escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazing blend of attacks. When I was thinking about it, I immediately understood what happened, and my forehead was cold and sweaty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Difficult, is it that I missed the 'Lonnie Big Detection Network'?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The expressionless man nodded. The door was soft and the legs were smashed down against the gully. The explosion of the Lenny Big Detection Network... The loss of the Republic is still second. All the magic inside will be released in an instant, it is a big to terrible concept. He does not believe that Anne and Yanika can hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it mean that... is this the intention of the gods? Perhaps he should not seek any status or participation in any army. If he is not here today, this tragedy will not happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie! 黛妮卡!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shouted out loudly. The sound passed into the ditch, echoed inside, and gradually disappeared...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can hear it without such a loud voice." "Don't say something like we have an accident." !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The irritating response from the left and right sides of the crisp female voice. He stood up in surprise and did not hesitate to jump out of the trench that couldn't see how deep it was; the side of Parker tried to catch him, but he couldn't get it. After jumping down, Naimen knew how wrong his judgment was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted to hold the ditch wall, but was surprised to find that the ditch wall was even smoother than the glass! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well! Forgetting the detonated law will turn into a pure flame..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp That is a purely magical origin than the fastest machining tool. Reason has just reacted here, and his body has been shot on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No... there is no such thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have not here. Not so much Here is the bottom of the trench, it is better to say that it is a luxury corridor. It is too clean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ninja and Anne talked and gave up the search, from both ends of the trench Central mobile. Relatively speaking, Anne was closer to the whispering position of the door lying on the ground - so she stepped on him first. At all, she did not expect to step on the stumbling block in the "Mansion Corridor" and she completely lost her balance. She did not wait for the superb motor nerve reaction to fall on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful girl who pressed the ribs with a fragrant fall was snoring, and the right eye of the eye was turned white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sordenton?! How come you jumped?" Anne immediately recognized him from the shackles. "You thought you could jump miraculously." Don't you hurt?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I guess there will be a beautiful girl rescue me under the cliff, but I didn't expect her to step on my ribs." The faint voice complained that the oppressed chest did not allow him to answer with a louder voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the name used by the door, I was rushing around with lighting and rushing over. When she saw the entangled Anne and Nani, she snorted and stopped in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't misunderstand! We just accidentally stumbled..." Annie hurriedly argued that she got up and patted the dust on her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 shakes his head, his left hand covers his mouth, and the illuminated effect has a finger to the face of the teenager. Anne followed her fingertips and was taken aback and stepped back two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God...how did you make this look?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into her eyes It is the black burned skin that looks like an eye-catching eye, and the creepy left eye of the eye. It is a wound that is difficult to describe, but it is enough for the average person to read and not eat. Renee took a breath and squatted beside the green plum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'll give it a try." Annie pulled out a bottle of dark blue potion and sent it to the door. Seneca looked at the bottle of extravagant potion with a little surprise and made the same tongue movement as the reaction before the door. The young boy’s lips, which had been slightly restored, swallowed and swallowed this slightly sweet potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white light of the treatment shrouded his body, healing almost all fractures and skin injuries; but the left eye did not look any better, the skin color around and The color of the eyelids is still very weird. After a moment, he woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonica immediately asked with concern: "Can you see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I try Try it... or not." Resist the door open his left eye and then close it painfully. "Thank you. I can ask you if you are searching for something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Perhaps, this time you have made a great mistake. Govar is probably dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dead? Marshal, he... I am "The doorman stood up and stood up, and the news didn't surprise him." He is already ready to see the double-digit deceased, and now only one deceased has made him very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe it’s better to say that he chose to die. This is how he finally decided to be loyal to the country." Annie continued, "Some extreme, but He left... very calm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie and 黛nica both saw Radz; Govar’s final decision. About tired of life as a political symbol, the marshal finally chose a calm death. When the pure energy of silver rises into the sky, others are lying down or trying to survive with defensive magic. Only he walks into the silver light against the gravel. He used his actions to prove that a real soldier can have no impassioned speech when he dies. He can have no heroic behavior, and he can even have no last words. Gowar chose to leave the political vortex calmly and without leaving a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, he finally chose this path."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door and the freedom The highest commander of the army has only a few faces. When he was awarded the rank of lieutenant, when he was talking on the pier, and when he was talking on the dock... Every time he saw Radz, he felt that this great commander took another step in the lonely road of death. Whether there are countless people around him or sitting alone on the fort, his desolate look has not changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, his death made us lose the reason to continue fighting. Right, 黛妮卡?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? Well, yeah. You don't have to fight with you, it's the only thing that deserves to be happy." Seneca raised her head from negative emotions and restored some of her past optimism. I think we should leave before your reinforcements come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie stunned. "Leaving? Are you still planning to come back now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now give up, I am afraid I will regret it forever. You are all magicians like me, believe You can understand.” Seneca suddenly approached Annie, hugged her with her arms and whispered in her ear. “I will pray for you at Imperial University. I hope we will see each other again.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding the body of Jenny, Anne is a little bit crying. This scene reminded her of her graduation ceremony in high school - it was a thing in another world, and it was already too long to be impressed. Even in her time, she has never been to college. "If you have trouble one day or want to do something else, come to me and Bonnie. I hope you can become a great magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Thank you.” Renee let go and turn to Soleton. “And, thank you, Soledon. This is the last time you saved me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Her right hand suddenly hides behind her, letting the light inside the tunnel go out instantly. Taking advantage of this embarrassing opportunity, she gave a soft kiss on Soledon's left cheek. The juvenile's right eye is wide, the temperature of the face's skin is hard to rise by itself, and the cheek becomes the color of the new magic that the healing magic has brought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Goodbye, my best friends. Take a step first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮The card grabbed the rope she and Annie climbed down, scorned the spell, and the rope became shorter and pulled her out of the trench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! You are really quick to turn your face! Is it necessary to be wary?" Annie couldn’t help but laugh. "The agreement I said before is still valid! It is impossible to take Your companion is going to change your credit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yunica’s voice is already coming out of the trench: "Sorry, but I will not be up for a long time to be companion We are suspicious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not a 'chameleon witch'" Nika; Wei Lun, it's completely unprepared." Anne sighed, preparing for magic The process is not stopped. Her right hand was shot on the wall of the ditch that was compressed by the pure energy flame, and a neat escalator emerged on the ditch wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lieutenant Solitaire, it’s time to go. When are you going to take it? Do you need to wake up on the right side?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
