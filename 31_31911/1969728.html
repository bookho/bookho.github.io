			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first chapter of the blood sand is full of gold and jade, and it is not as good as its own.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s not a long-term guarantee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jinyu Mantang can be kept, rich and arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Lao Tzu, "The Book of Tao", verse 9 (bookoftao9:01-9:05, stocius)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The official meeting place of both parties is arranged in the Taiji Hall in the center of Taiping Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "March Bing, Red Priest Speaking to Sabonnie for tribute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The official officer of Hengqu Zong wrote this record on his yellow crepe paper. After <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, he shrank in the corner of the octagonal hall, waiting for the visitors to officially enter the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last pagan leader entered this Taiji Temple, or something six hundred years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly six centuries ago, a generation of gas master Zha Zai failed in the school dispute of the Eastern Empire, with his disciple Xidu Qianlonghai, in Taiping Reconstructed his own Hengqu Academy under the door. He advocated the unity of Confucianism and Taoism, sweeping away the past straits of Taiping, and cultivating disciples as much as crossing the river. Finally, the sergeant at the time felt threatened and invited Zhang Hengqu to come to Qingniufu in the name of discussing the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""The first division of the Hengqu was alone in the Taiji Temple, and it was arguing for four days and five nights, and the road was finally ridiculed."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows what actually happened in these five days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People only know that since this "five-day debate", the order of the priests is no longer from the Taiping Palace, but from the Hengqu. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhang Zai relied on the body of the Great Confucianism to take the right path and took over the Wei Daojun with his disciples and the big people who were effective, and opened the first period of cross-border administration. The cross-river swept the Knights of the Komans who were entrenched in the port of Murrayman, and established the Taiping Principality of the combination of politics and religion in Interry and West Murray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national costume is still red, the Eastern Empire said that the country under his rule is the red shirt. His army even conquered the Interlaken Island. After more than three hundred years of entanglement, the Komans used more than a hundred years of war to gradually regain the Interlaken region. After so many years, there was finally a pagan leader, the Archbishop from the West, who entered the Taiji Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the red ambassador Sabonni on the temple!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On behalf of Bonnie Seifer, see you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeated commands in both languages ​​echoed inside and outside the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Innovative General Bishop, the innocent lord of the Protestant Church, Bonnie Sefer, took a deep breath and looked at the new road with an interest The state power was used to welcome her battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On both sides of the Royal Road in front of her, the squadron’s spears are in vain, not inferior to the guards behind her, who are almost pure female soldiers. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven’t made an appointment yet. Your Excellency, you really have to accept the request of someone alone?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander of the Guards Company, Captain Sophia of the miracle division still wants to finally struggle, and strive to bring a class, even if three or five elite guards enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone, let's conclude a covenant, don't worry. Besides, I am Bonnie Seifer, but I don't need everyone's protection." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie’s mouth glimpsed, and a burst of laughter broke out in the Guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is also. We are only dragging down the sacred woman of the Arcane sect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie dialed the brown hair of the horns and nodded, striding towards the octagonal palace at the end of the ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't look so easy. As one of the biggest behind-the-scenes investors in the country, Bonnie did not think that this venture could really be a success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought that she would be as hard as four years in our history, with the help of rabies Cliff, the opportunity to reclaim the land to win the country. ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike her sister Anne, Bonnie considers herself to be a fairly qualified passer, and counts the historical events of this era. I know a little bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie Sefer recalls his own history in his mind, moving along the Imperial Road, from time to time on the white jade bricks of Yudao The heel is striking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For today’s battle, she has specially selected a pair of translucent enchanting women’s boots with pure white crystal texture, which is built with future technology and is suitable for exploration. The structure of this pagan magic. In the era of Bonnie's original life, this huge magic has long been a part of the historical relics, no longer functioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this era, should this road be still running?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crystal Boots Stepping on the Imperial Road, igniting a gentle magical rebound, if you step on the water bed. Under this royal road, it is the belief system established when the Yellow Turban Taiping Taoist country flourished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s the grand system that the Yellow Turban Taiping Road has built with hundreds of years of effort, and it’s really extraordinary.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie thought so, stepped onto the steps of the main hall and walked into the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought she would see Zhang Wenyi’s Wenwu Baiguan sitting around the octagonal hall and waiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in reality, only Bonnie’s squad is clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Herald Messenger Sabonni arrives!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the empty hall, There were not even a few guards, and no one paid attention to her. Bonnie turned her eyes to the middle of the main hall and saw the jade seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is sitting on the jade seat - it is not surprising that during the reign of Zhang Futu, the official dynasty held in the Taiji Temple did not add up to five. Ten times; even if it is really held, Zhang Futu will not necessarily choose to sit in the hot jade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange thing is that the current sergeant, Zhang Shiyi, is standing in the middle of the almost empty hall, wiping a shiny silver pistol. In the entire hall, except for the guards at the entrance and the historical officials in the corner, only she was waiting for the guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her petite body is in stark contrast to the shiny silver gun in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This empty hall shows a lot of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie looks around: Nami Soleton is not here either. This also explains a lot of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new sergeant has her family, but the country is still too big. In the face of this huge interest that suddenly comes to hand, the former subordinates may no longer be subordinates, the family is no longer a family, and the enemy is still an enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi wiped his gun, staring at the girl who entered the temple, and the magnificent bishop's tunic on her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, she was also amazed at the youth of the Archbishop. Bonnie Seifer seems to be less than twenty years old, and the real age does not seem to be twenty. But she will not despise this girl who is similar to her own age: unlike Miss Zhang, who inherits the family business, the princes who dominated the Red Army church actually started from scratch by their own magical ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new sergeant sighed softly. She is not only her own family, but also the whole country. The young woman in front of her is one of the characters she must consider. At the time of the phase, Bonnie’s forces have reached a cooperation with her. In the new situation, further negotiations are imperative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The phase port is a few months away, and Miss Yanshi looks a lot worse. Murrayman is almost the same as the whole South Coman; it is not easy to rule such a big country."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie Sefer calmly sent a greeting to the owner, but cautiously stayed on the edge of the mid-range magic. As a high-ranking caster who is proficient in magic and arcane, this is the most advantageous distance for Bonnie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi wiped the tip of the gun, walked to the jade seat of the priest, and placed the gun tip on the armrest of the jade seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her tip of the gun touched the base of the jade seat, and a golden light illuminates the tip of the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Sefer wears a very beautiful dress. Is this your bishop's dress?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher did not stare at what Bonnie was wearing. She did not even look at Bonnie's white low-cut dress and emerald cloak, but asked such a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this is just my favorite clothes. Like our army, the churches and the churches also have their favorite uniforms; and I am In the highest priest outside the old church, I can choose what I want to wear every day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie reveals a smile that shows six teeth, continues "One of my hobbies is to help a friend's tailor shop to design a clothing brand. In terms of enchantment sewing, I am confident that I still have some talent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not actually Saying what you like to wear, not talking about sewing and clothing stores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop of Faus is saying that I can be backed by the whole church and become an ally to help you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition, you can call me Bonnie directly, which may be more intimate? Let us talk like girls of the same age."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi lifted the silver gun that had been shining with golden light, and looked at the glaring gunpoint. In response to Bonnie’s inquiry, she responded in this way:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It seems that the Archbishop’s Highness should know this Taiji Temple.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi did not call the name of the female bishop in front. The negotiations are still going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie turned his heel and took a small step forward and replied: "As far as I know, this palace is the center of the country, storing the right way. The place of strength. The power of faith in the right way will be brought together on this jade seat, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The stone of the jade gentleman. After controlling the entire East China Sea countries, they gathered the world's jade and became the four major provinces on the land of Murrayman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The power of the right way can manipulate the wind and thunder of the heavens and the earth. But not every generation of masters can manipulate it. Using it itself means a huge risk, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Her crystal shoes stepped on the Imperial Road, and the energy delivered by the Royal Road was passed under the jade seat beside Zhang Shiyi. The power of the right path of the entire Qingniu and Dao is transmitted along the Eight Avenues to the main hall. Even with the power of Bonnie, she can feel the hidden threat of the right path under her feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Since then, not only using it, but having it itself has become a huge risk. As the archbishop of the Covenant Church Will His Highness understand this risk?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power is filling the rifle in the hands of Zhang Shiyi, the golden light seems to be physical, playing around the Taiji Temple The golden nanmu is on the big column. The guards had already smashed before this might, and several of the close servants and historians in the corner were also on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the golden light of the right path, Bonnie took a small step forward and smiled: "It turns out that Zhang Yishi also read our church in Hongyi. The history of reform."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the word "Red Yi", Zhang Shiyi laughed after two loud words and said: "The history of the reform of your church has made me Think of the troubled times in the country. In order to compete for the power of the church, the central government of the Holy See is gradually corrupted, swaying, and blood flowing everywhere. The strongmen of all sects are in good fashion. Once they have the power, the bishops at all levels immediately turn their faces, assassinating the fire, and slamming the door. Extinction... until you are separated from the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need a ally who has combat power. There is no lack of faith and money in this land of Daoguo. But I need to be able to help me against Zhang Futu's allies and the power to deter the subordinates."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie gaze at the silver gun that shines in the hands of Zhang Shiyi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, His Royal Highness still wants to know how much power we have in the Freedom of Nations to form an alliance with you, right?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi’s gunpoint is horizontal: “No. I have seen you have strong officers and well-trained troops. I just want to know, you will reform, and How many abilities do you have in the presence of the Archbishop? Are you ready?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie Seifer smiled a bit and whispered: “In short, Negotiating alone is to try my fame, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, it’s hard to fight Zhang Futu to get the jade seat and the right path above, just right. There is also an opponent who is said to be unpredictable and unsolicited. If you don’t try it, I’m sorry for this power!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a half-day shelf and play it Zhang Shiyi, who was half-day silver gun, finally showed his nature. Her slender fingers were wiped from the gun and the right hand was pulled back. The gun with the golden light immediately constructed an attacking posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the gun attack so far? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie thought so, but did not dare to lighten the enemy, the left hand flicked, the left hand five fingers and the defensive magic stored on the ring were all activated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that in the country, the guests should satisfy the owner’s wishes." The chief bishop, Ang’s head, said, "If the priest’s Highness has an affair with Yaxing, please Attacked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi is not welcome, The golden light flashed on both feet, and the petite figure crossed the entire hall like a lead bullet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a remote attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie made a judgment instantly, left foot forward As soon as he gets up, his right hand immediately throws forward the prepared defense magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"forcewall!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is not clear in this Tai Chi Temple How many magics can be activated, and it is not clear what Zhang Shiyi is the best in the right way. The first magic that Bonnie chose is to isolate all penetrating attacks, and the tyrannical six-segment magical power wall. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi keeps going, the gunpoint is on the wall of the invisible force field, and the tip of the gun is on the magic plane -<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This force field wall that should have been able to block all tangible things was actually rolled up by the golden light of the gun tip, and it was pulled out and hit the big pillar of the golden nanmu wood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie is stunned – even after two hundred years, this hand is enough to send a paper in the Journal of the Arbitration Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this the highest level of ignorance of consumption?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a theoretical force wall It is indeed possible to scroll with another force field, but she is the first to see such extravagant usage in actual combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With other magical neutralizations, it is usually more labor-saving than using brute force to open the entire wall. Whether it's an arcane system that is good at stereotypes or a result-oriented magic system, it's hard to do this—it's the expertise of a Taoist system that's good at magic. In the Bible ethics of Taoism, it tells the basic idea of ​​using magic like water. The two great rivers in the suburbs of Qingniu are named after the most famous introduction in this section: goodness and water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All fixed defensive magic can't be used!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This judgment is in Bonnie Flashed through my mind. Her right hand shook, and the prepared iron wall and the iridescent wall were also instantly released. They slammed on the ground and leaped backwards to try to avoid the unstoppable attack line of Zhang Shiyi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of the eye of the sergeant swept away and judged the direction of the other party's escape. Bonnie used suspension to reduce her weight to near zero, and then used the magic of the enhanced jumping power to escape the attack of Zhang Shiyi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to fight in the air?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi’s mouth sneaked out. The Hengqu Zong, to which she belongs, does not look like a heavy-duty device like the Eastern factions. She does not need to fly a sword or domesticate a beast. However, in terms of the ability to manipulate "Tao" and "righteousness", the cross-channel that blends the strengths of Confucianism and Taoism is the first place in the magical schools of the East. The Hengqu Zong monks often fought against the monks under Zhang Futu, and they had their own set of tactics for high-speed maneuvers in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sergeant gently presses the gun body, and the tip of the gun rises like a golden snake in the air. The overflowing positive gas is turned into a sharp arrow, and it is directed to Bonnie who jumps in the air with the help of the pillars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it seems that even remote attacks are expected by Bonnie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the Master is worried that the air battle will destroy this precious hall, please say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She not only avoided these attacks, but also jumped and threw such a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, don't worry about this. This thousand-year-old Taiji Temple is not so fragile."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi turned around and chased Bonnie’s figure and rushed back to the center of the hall. The golden anger was chasing, and it was shot around Bonnie’s figure. None of these golden arrows were shot, almost all hit the ceiling of the nearly ten-meter clear sky in the hall and the dozens of large Nanmu columns around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Bonnie’s figure was moving through the air, it has been transformed into one, two, three, and more and more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is trying to use the flash and mirror to spread the firepower of Zhang Shiyi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The defensive magic on these columns is really interesting. It’s not a rebound, it’s not a simple protection. All the light bombs are on the surface of the column. Is the skill of Taoism?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie’s commentary came from all directions, and her avatar image in the air has exceeded twenty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhang Shiyi is also secretly swearing: Although I don’t understand the principles of Western arcane and magical magic, the number of avatars that can be controlled by the avatar should obviously be proportional to Master's magical ability. In addition to her legends and novels, she has never seen a monk who can control more than ten avatars, and the young woman in front can control more than twenty at the same time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t continue to fight again. She looked at the tip of the gun that had begun to fade, thinking so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Zhang Da broke the drink and turned the gun into more than ten phantoms. Each phantom is divided into five or six light tips, just like the Bonnies of the shells of the rifle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"定!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hands are wrong, it looks like the golden light from the gun I wiped it off. As the second command word came out, Jin Guang flew from her hands to the sky, all over the temple, and all the light arrows and light balls in the air stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, all the balls of light expand horizontally and become intertwined The circular plane with the golden light shining! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唉唉唉唉?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie’s amazing voice came from all angles of the air But it is a few less than just now. Several planes were unfolded in the plane and disappeared immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi looked up and ran up, leaping straight onto the jade seat, the boots kicked on the surface of the jade seat, borrowing high and leaping, almost touched the top of the hall Light transmission hole. At the same time as she jumped into the jade seat, the rifle in her hand had already had some faint light, and immediately lit up again like a noon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the images of the Archbishop are exposed to the alert, tightening their bodies in the flash of light, and each is ready to look for jumping points to return to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Miss Yanshi did not give them a chance to return to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless lights scattered in the temple, no dead ends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of Taoism varies according to the school. There are many ways to call it, and there are subtle differences in practical use, such as inner, instinct, internal force, and righteousness. , Dao Li, Chakra, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these forces have a common characteristic, it is "the power of Taoism is like water." The power of arcane comes from logic and experimentation. The power of magic comes from beliefs and prayers. There are clear ways of using and paradigm, but there is no such thing as water: the power of water can be used to invent all kinds of Taoist effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi had only imagined this attack in theory before, and she could not use this trick until she got the power of Jade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this should not kill the guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all hit The mirror Bonnie disappeared, and only a few mirrors flashed in the light rain, flashing most of the attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the teacher saw the correct goal. One of the mirrors was trying to dodge, but her dress was cut by light rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"End!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi kicked on the ceiling of the main hall, borrowing straight Rush to the target and gather all the remaining jade powers on top of your gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gun was finally unstoppable, and all of Bonnie’s defensive magic was bounced off in front of the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken magic dust blows on the face of Zhang Shiyi, as if it is a breath of victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two took great impulses and squatted together on the white paved floor of the Taiji Hall. Zhang Shiyi’s hand felt a backlash and his body slammed into Bonnie. She was sure what was in the shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The priest of the priest is really powerful. I have to borrow some strength from my god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Bonnie’s voice is still quiet. Her left wrist became translucent and the white light came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi fixed his eyes and saw his own silver gun full of the right way, so it was embedded in Bonnie’s left hand, which was completely sacred. Stay in a position that is only a few inches from her throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tip of the gun stayed on the back of her left hand, just like being clamped by a steel pliers, no longer allowed to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power of our innovation society is just like this. I wonder if my master can still be satisfied?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Zhang Shiyi knows that his face is not very good-looking. She asked herself to come up with all the strengths of her own and even the peace, but the opposite defense ability seems to be bottomless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You haven’t retaliated from start to finish, right, Bishop Bonnie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Bonnie Seifer licked his lips and did not answer the question of the teacher. Instead, he asked: "So, can our covenant be established?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I feel that your power is so strong that it will endanger our country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there is nothing in the world that can solve all problems. A panacea. At least, I don't have the will to fight back. This is not my land."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere between the two has solidified. After a while, Zhang Shiyi only opened again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I still have a problem at the end, I want to ask when I am in the phase port. Why do you want to cooperate with me?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie replied with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the temple door opened again - specifically, it was hit by a few guards and intruders with their shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is going on here? Why did you meet a quarter of an hour before, and you are here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Nenmen Soledon rubbed the sweat on his forehead and gasped into the temple door. Behind him, he was waiting for the joint military officer group outside the hall and the civil and military officials of the Hengqu, but no one dared to take the lead into the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie lying on the floor and Zhang Shiyi sitting on Bonnie’s body were just as good as they said, and turned their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the person is the door, Bonnie immediately put away the magical magic on the left arm, Zhang Shiyi also pulled back his gun and bounced from the floor Get up. Bonnie stood up and pressed her right hand on the back of her left hand to heal the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door looked at these two big men, a little dissatisfied, "Is the winglet you used jade? Bonnie, you used it." "God? What is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We just just finished the negotiation, this is a little after-work activity after the negotiation." Zhang Shiyi turned to the door, Yang said, "So, Wenwu Baiguan has arrived? Held a dynasty, announced the covenant! Clean up the treasury of the Green Bull House, pay the Bonnie and her church army!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd poured into the hall, noisy and chaotic. The history officer picked up his own record and began to record today's events. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The specific terms need to be determined now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this chaos, Bonnie whispered in a voice that only three people could hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All at least in accordance with the old treaty of Zhang Futu and the Elf, plus the trading company of the military, commercial and phase port. I also have a large part of the trading company. As for the internal The ambitions, the surrendered wall grass and the external enemies, we can deal with them slowly. Come to the Japanese party."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the fierce battle, Zhang Shiyi appeared to be interested in actual negotiations. Missing, impatiently throwing out his own conditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie nodded: "His Lord's Highness can be assured. At least until the Elf Fleet and Zhang Futu have completely disappeared, we are still allies. Even if they disappear, Our strength will still be placed in the direction of the Empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi smiled: "Since we are allies, you can also call me winglet. I will Ordering to reject other South Coomers who are trying to contact me, all partners must enter your country through your people or those who are resistant to the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State Ni Yang raised her eyebrows. There is a message in this sentence: There are already other people who have entered the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for reminding, little wing. I have a few in my heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These two women who have just lived and died, but now they talk about each other like a biological sister, meditation over and over again in the heart, "women are really difficult to understand." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but remember the order that Bonnie brought yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was an urgent order that allowed him to return to the phase of the port and report to the Republic and the Free Army headquarters. Time is not very tight, and he is ordered to stabilize the republics in the interests of Murray and then return to his debriefing, at all costs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, he was not very anxious to go back, but the two dangerous women in front of him made him feel the first time he wanted to return to the port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe the country is still too big for me...not a small major capable of interfering."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the door was so thinking, he suddenly heard his name slip into his ear. People are always sensitive to their names. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition, Bonnie, are you planning to marry Nana?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you don't have this plan, Nana will marry me. Every single young girl with huge powers has to find a husband. And this is also good for our covenant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her two audiences widened their eyes and opened their mouths slightly, and had no time to answer this blunt and straightforward question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As far as the current situation is concerned, it is difficult for me to find a marriage suitable for the rule of the country. The famous doors of Haixi and Qingniu have their own problems. If you want to marry them, you might as well be single. If you marry me, the whole country can be dowry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie is stuttering for the first time today: "That, I... I don't have this plan. But, that, how do you say, this thing, this thing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie Se Phil never felt so sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I refuse this question? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the perspective of her sister, she should be 100% trying to break Zhang Shiyi’s proposal. In this world, no one knows her sister's feelings better than her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her sister and Namie Soledon have a marriage contract? But it is not the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real story is much more complicated than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her sister, Anne Seifer, likes to endure. I like it from the future and I always like it until now. But she is not a living person now, nor a dead person, and certainly not a zombie. Anne's memory and soul are divided into two parts, the soul and the spare body are missing together, and the memory is now in the hands of the door...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the relationship between the two? This matter even Bonnie himself could not tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie panicked and sent a message to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"", "If you don't want to, how about I pretend to be your fiancee?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just sent out, Bonnie immediately felt that it was not right, and hurriedly sent another one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That, if you like, I have no opinion..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article seems to Not too right. Bonnie hurriedly reissued one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not saying that I can be your fiancee, I mean if you are willing to marry Miss... I am not saying that you can marry Miss! Let me think about it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi’s eyes narrowed and raised his hand to play with his ponytail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bonnie, if you have a marriage contract, you can tell me directly. Are you really not his fiancee?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Zhang Shiyi, a battle genius, clearly smelled the flaw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, but..." Bonnie stuttered to find a way to get around this problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Bonnie Seifer is not my fiancée, nor my lover. But I can't accept your marriage contract, Zhang Shiyi's Highness." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Nami Soleton quietly spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I have a lover in my hometown Lenny. Although she is still missing and does not know life or death, I don't know if she is willing to accept my proposal, but I I will try to make her become my fiancée. That is, please forgive me for rejecting this marriage contract, and the female ruler of the Taoist country should not marry a man who has fallen in love with others."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His rejection is clear and clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know when the entire hall was quiet, only the voice of Nami Soleton echoed in the hall. The civil and military officials, the coalition staff, and the Daowei soldiers all stared at him with amazement, as if staring at a madman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
