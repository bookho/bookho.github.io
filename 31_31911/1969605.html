			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is so good; Sorelton doesn’t know yet, his teacher is just a stone's throw away from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the cover of the faint rain curtain, the middle-aged man in a blue military uniform stands on the seaside hill not far from the south of Fort. The telescope looks at the huge fortress in the north. Although he is in a very dangerous enemy territory, his expression is still so extraordinarily calm, and he can't see even a slight worry. Like everyone else around him, his shoulders are not adorned with epaulettes, but this does not damage his lofty status - he is the commander of the Free Army Southwest Army, Clade; Lieutenant General Lopez (on the line) . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distant fortress is exceptionally clear under the combination of the objective lens and the eyepiece, and even the turret on the inner wall is clearly visible. After a few counts of the number of cannons visible in the South Bank fortress, Clade; Lopez's mouth twitched slightly. That number...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too much, it’s too much. There are already so many amazing cannons that have not yet been counted in the North Shore, the estuary, and the auxiliary fortresses; if all are counted, how many cannons should there be? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than 30 cities and fortresses in his life, but the ranks of those cities are completely different from this fortress. Perhaps it has been long-standing, and the city of the East still stays at the stage of the oldest “high-walled grain”, only to resist rogues and thieves; but the fortress here is not the case. Fort Buddha is not only a fortification fortress, it is also a weapon of attack. Since the Fourth Freedom of War, this fortress has been built and continues to form the current high-profile fortress group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fortress can only be placed in the 'second fortress of the Republic', if the first fortress Fort Stilt is to be conquered..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He muttered to himself and made a possible future battle in his mind. As long as they have the right to control the sea, the defenders on both sides of the strait can easily support each other and delay the army of the attackers. Fortress is located in the core hub of the Republic, and attacks in almost all directions have the advantage of being located inside and being free to move. The troops stationed in it can leave only a small number of troops to contain all the enemy forces and quickly maneuver through land and waterways, thus destroying another enemy. The middle-aged man's fingers were swayed on the invisible map, and he shivered slightly as he pushed: he seemed to have seen the Armenian army under his command being suppressed under the city, while the French army of the East Road was blocked by the defenders. The possibility of lightning breaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "General, you have been staying here for nearly half an hour, it is too risky. If the other party finds out here, I am afraid I am already mobilizing the troops. You have maintained the safety of the entire federation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young adjutant around the officer looked around and worried. Born in the intelligence department, he is now the first chief of staff of the staff headquarters. Hull; Lieutenant Colonel Tedwood has sent three elite reconnaissance teams to guard, but he is still worried that he will be discovered by the other reconnaissance units. Although the coup was screaming "no civil war", the former intelligence officer was very determined that the opponent would definitely continue to conduct reconnaissance and anti-reconnaissance. After all, the slogans are all slogans, and what you actually do must be carried out in accordance with the military code. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry. According to the distance here, even if we are found, it will take at least twenty minutes to get around. Now we stay here here too. Only fourteen minutes, I still have time to rush to the next commanding height. I also want to see the support between the three outer bunkers on the south side." Klad; Lopez casually reported a string of time numbers as a rebuttal. There is a long blank period in General Lopez’s archives, but this does not change the fact that he is also from a military academy – he knows the Freedom Army’s working methods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her frowned and retorted: "But is it necessary to take such an adventure? If you want to know the defense and strength of Fodenburg, as long as It’s good to check the documents at the staff headquarters... The assignment of the other party will not be far from the plan. I absolutely disapprove of your continued risk-taking behavior, knowing that there is another important meeting this afternoon!”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a big soldier in the East who says that only by knowing the enemy with his own eyes can he win the battle. I believe this." Clad took the telescope and said, "The other party also The same is the Free Army. They also know that we will consult the documents. When our actions have fallen into the enemy's calculations, we will definitely be at a disadvantage. Never underestimate your opponent."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Hull; Tedwood's face became slightly white: "Encounter. They really used a new password."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That is to say, there are still twenty minutes." The general turned his back on the horse, his legs were caught in the horse's belly, and the horse galloped down the gentle slope. "The order is going on, the whole team will retreat quickly! All reconnaissance teams will be evacuated within five minutes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following." Lieutenant Colonel Hull hesitated, and around The staff of the staff stayed behind the highest commander. A team of forty light cavalry left the hills and ran along the coast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The climate of the west coast of Interlake Bay is warm and humid, and the volcanic forest consisting of low shrubs and trees is scattered around the sea. It should be hidden. The good environment; however, the situation seems to be somewhat unsatisfactory and has not developed in accordance with Klad’s “twenty-minute” estimate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fortress garrison did not go back to ask for help, but bit the tail of the team like a fly. As the pursuit continued, the number of followers did not decrease, but began to increase: Obviously, the coup army invested a large number of reconnaissance units nearby, using the same magic color smoke signal as a liaison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followers did not fire, but did not retreat, the two sides have maintained a distance of about three hundred meters. When he left the beach and approached the road, Krades simply stopped Malay: Sure enough, the pursuers also stopped and stopped at the maximum range of the cavalry pistol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, what are you doing?! This is very dangerous!" Lieutenant Colonel Hull approached his sergeant and asked in a quick speech. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crad did not answer this question, but just looked back and calmly commented on the other’s actions: “The order of the Free Army has changed even more. There is no unconcealed tracking and reconnaissance... The other’s staff is quite bold, and we are sure that we will not take the initiative to make this decision.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing General’s comment, Hull, who is the head of the temporary staff, couldn’t help it. He retorted: "In any case, this kind of order really ignores the lives of the reconnaissance soldiers. If it is to fight the empire, how many experienced scouts will be lost? The first purpose of the reconnaissance force is to bring back intelligence, not The war died on the front line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I personally agree with your cautious approach, but the ability of the other party to adapt to the situation is also very noteworthy. This is not only the style of the staff. Different, it is the difference of the coach's approach. If it is me, it will not approve such a very risky regulation. The other party is just understanding - or estimating my character and style, will use this I hope that your staff can also try to include the character and style of the enemy in thinking, not just the calculation of intelligence and data. I guess that 80% of the staff officer there is from the strategic analysis department or The Special Operations Department."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crader explained leisurely that this series of warnings made Hull's look change. Former intelligence officers are accustomed to the collection and classification of intelligence, but they are not good at post-analysis and processing. He sighed and thought about the advice of his superiors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When it comes to personality, what kind of person is this lord himself? There is no cautiousness in his own security issues, but in the use of soldiers and deployment It’s also very cautious... quite cautious on the appointments, but there’s no cautiousness in assigning tasks to his subordinates.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Positive Hull When thinking about the character of the commander, the general spoke again: "Since the other party has not caught up, we will continue to go. All turn to the East, use 60% speed!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her's eyebrows picked up again. East? Instead of going back to the temporary camp in the southwest, go to the Rafael Cape in the east? Sixty percent speed? Not fully able to get rid of the other side's pursuit, but to use the unpleasant speed to lure the opponent to pursue? What is thinking about this boss’s brain? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it." The lieutenant rose his head: I must have a good idea for the sergeant. He doesn't have to worry about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last prophecy was once, doing a good job, major. If this time you can catch the other commander, I will definitely pay you back, Cousin For four consecutive afternoons, the uniformed warnings have finally been compensated.” Ega; Colonel Eugen chewed the gums, chasing the traces left by the outpost reconnaissance forces, galloping on the rugged seaside hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really annoying to make a special trip twice in the afternoon. It’s even more annoying because of the four-hour continuous warning state caused by the magic of prophecy. Since the reconnaissance of the 5th Division of the Lenny Government Army and the Klad Temporary Division in the battalion set 30 kilometers southwest of the fortress, the entire fortress has been shrouded in a tense atmosphere. The 7,000 soldiers here can't resist the assaults of two full-filled divisions. If you can catch the other officer's officers, you will naturally be able to know the true intentions of the enemy. Now, the desire of the staff officers to make meritorious demeanor has been overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the name of Naimen; Soledon's fake ensign. The teenager is following the big team with fear and enthusiasm, and there is a special service that he does not want to show. When he thinks of confronting his own teacher's troops, he has an instinctive resistance. But he must follow the brigade - not only because he does not want to be seen, but also because he wants to see if he can take the opportunity to contact his teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This direction, one minute and fifteen seconds ago! The two sides still have no battle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last A scout who left the contact met with their brigade, accompanied by a report on the distance and condition of the enemy retreating ahead. Upon hearing this news, the people in the chase team were ecstatic, and they involuntarily urged their mounts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will it be too fast, Lieutenant Colonel? Be careful of the trap, we can have eaten this loss that night." Captain Itis is skilled. The equestrian circumvented the mount of Major Cousin and sneaked in the ear of Lieutenant Colonel Eugen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry, Miss Itis." Lieutenant Colonel Eugen passed a confident smile on his face. "With our lineup here, they can't." How about taking us. It’s not Lenny two weeks ago...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is not falling, everyone is on the hill on the south side of Cape Lafar The horse slammed on the horse and looked down at the encircled team of the Lenny government. They gathered on the beach by the sea and gathered together in a mess. Most people had taken pistols and sabers from their waists. There was no sign on each shoulder that could identify the rank or identity. About twice, no, three times their coups - or the government forces trapped them from three sides, and more weapons were aimed at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lieutenant Colonel Eugen jumped off the hill and shouted: "You are surrounded by the Freedom Army colleagues, please let go of the weapon..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn’t finished talking, and suddenly there is a short scream that apparently blurted out behind him. The second half of the scream was almost immediately cut off, but it still could not prevent the two sides from simultaneously noticing the person who made the scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are fewer door-to-doors, what's wrong?" Captain Ittis asked and asked, "What are you surprised?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negman; Soledon ignored her, but biting her lips with annoyance, and regretted that she should not give out the subconscious scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How, did the teacher not recognize me? I am Soledon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt an urge to rush to the teacher immediately, but he also knew that this would be immediately beaten into a honeycomb by the colleagues in his hands. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lowered his head and stared at the opposite middle-aged man with the corner of his eye. Clade; Lopez is still standing there coldly, looking at him, can not see even a trace of emotional fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just in the moment of some desperation, the teenager noticed that Mr. Klad’s indifferent expression shook slightly, and his stone was generally difficult to shake the chin three times. Soledon has seen this movement several times and knows the meaning of this action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do as you like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but can I do it? The young man asked himself, did not get an answer, but still made up his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soleton resolutely raised his head and touched his chin, stuttering and saying: "I just think...there are people who are a little familiar, I used to look like I have seen it once in the staff headquarters, but I don’t remember very well.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A little familiar?” The staff of several other coups immediately followed his line of sight. In the past, I looked at the middle-aged people with a cold face. Looking closely, Peter, who had served at the headquarters, and Captain Itis, almost simultaneously exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pension from Lieutenant Colonel Eugen to Scouting, from four-legged horses to two-legged people, surrounded by almost all coups The people all stepped back, and the horses, screams and whispers went one after another. Clade's mouth was slightly upturned and seemed to be very satisfied with the result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eugan slammed the mouth of the mouth, stepping forward in two steps, asking in a very cautious tone: "Your lord... really is Clade; General Lopez?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her stepped forward in front of his chief: "No, this..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't have to be concealed, Lieutenant Colonel. They are all officers of the former staff headquarters, and they can't go on. Yes, I am Clade; Lopez." Klad; Pace faintly confirmed his identity. "It seems that this soldier is the new first chief of staff? I have never seen you before, can you ask for a big name?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eugen considered it for a moment, and replied: "The former special commander of the Department of Special Operations, the first staff officer of the Free Army Staff Headquarters, Ega; Lieutenant Colonel Eugen."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the opponent's officer's belonging, Hull; Tedwood looked at his chief and smiled a bit, admiring his estimation accuracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eugan looked at him with some ignorance and continued: "Sorry for the crime, but today we may ask you to visit our Fort. A few days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cradd put his hands on his chest and still replied coldly: "If I say no? Your Marshal Govar, is not talking." Say 'Do not fight civil war'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lieutenant Colonel Eugen hurriedly waved his hand: "No, no, it’s not a civil war, it’s just a friendly force. We invite the distinguished generals to be guests. We are the same as the Free Army. It is normal to exchange your combat experience. Please do not refuse - we really don't want to use force."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hull can’t help it anymore, two steps ahead, loudly: “You’re also a good staff officer, you don’t have to slip any more...”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crader suddenly patted the shoulders of this subordinate, blocked him, and a smile appeared in the corner of his mouth. "Yeah, Fort Fort is a good place, and it may be good to be a guest for two days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, it’s still the general of the general. We invite the general to be a guest. No malice..." Eugen hurriedly smiled, and he really didn't want to fight the enemy with this legendary magical power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crad did not pay attention to him, still smiled and continued: "Speaking of Fort Vatican, I can’t help but remember when I came here to spend my honeymoon with my wife. Memories - especially the Pello cheese stewed pigeons and the half-baked brandy veal steaks that have been eaten here are really the best. If you can go there for a vacation in your free time, it is a great pleasure in life. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, you are coming with us. Although there is a shortage of materials due to the recent blockade, no matter what kind of dishes, we will try our best to make it. Entertain you." Eugen rushed to pick it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, I have no leisure time recently. I can only refuse your good intentions from the lieutenant colonel." Clad’s index finger slammed, a blue light flashed across the sky. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hands!" Eugen slammed down on the beach, his head clasped his head and shouted. Several bullets flew out, but they were all blocked by Hull’s unknown magic. Then, a few muffled sounds hit the hills behind the encirclement of the coup, and there were several waves of high ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing this scene, Clade; Lopez's expression on his face regained indifference, but his mouth still tells the black humor of not funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven’t said it? I have a date today. I want to introduce you to this famous general known as the 'Flame General'. The commander-in-chief of the Faros Military Region and the Northeast Army, Wiener; Admiral Betsy, and the fleet of the Republic of England that carried him and his army. I don't want to provoke a civil war. What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the three warships that came out from the other side of the cape, Ega; Lieutenant Colonel Eugen’s face was white for a while; I don’t know when, his mouth was again Chewed the gum. But now, he has only one command left to post. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
