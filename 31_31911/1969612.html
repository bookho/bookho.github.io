			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ix<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man and women have many ways to learn. One of the most romantic ones is called "Hero Saves Beauty," which is often the beginning and end of a legend. In the eyes of others, the day Xiu Lan; Di Mattel and Lily; Maggie's first encounter is quite consistent with the definition of this encounter - but the results are somewhat biased. After the meeting, there is no heroic spirit, nor the romance of the body - only the bare bargain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mean... 10,000 pounds? Ten thousand pounds, just escorted to Lenny?! This is enough to buy a small manor!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xu Lan first reacted and asked indisputably. For an escort mission, this price is probably unprecedented - even if it is escorting the emperor, it is impossible to have such a high reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, 10,000 gold pounds, there is an absolute guarantee of the promissory note, and when you arrive at Lenny, you pay." The green-haired woman said that she began to pack up the wreckage of the carriage. Inside, I turned out a heavy wooden box. "You can probably make more than a thousand pounds here, and you can pay it as a deposit. No matter what contract you accepted before, is this price enough?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers exchanged their opinions with their eyes, and finally Shulan opened the box before it was almost - at the same time, everyone was amazed. The golden light shines inside, and there is a whole half a box of real gold pounds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So much, where is she sacred?" The paladin took the gold coins and slammed back into the ranks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The pursuit of the Free Army is not a civilian. I think it is suspicious, and contrary to our destination, don't accept this commission." Leifu frowned, a look of "more than one thing is less." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jet; Nitton hurriedly shook his head: "That is 10,000 gold coins, a whole 10,000 gold coins! As long as we take this commission, we have been taking a long time. There will be no more economic problems! What's more, we now have accidentally killed the employer, and even the economic guarantees behind it are not..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See this A weak woman is in danger and can't be saved, not the paladin's actions." Xiu Lan also helped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reeve snorted: "The Paladin? You can count this guy... 黛妮卡, what do you think?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah... I, I will abstain." Hearing Lenny, the girl with a complicated mood could not make a decision. If I go home in such a two-day period, it would be like just leaving home. She is not determined by this kind of determination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abort." Parker also replied indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two to one, that's it. Rest assured, Miss Namlock, we will not delay travel. Please trust us."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiu Lan turned to the new employer and said: "Then we will accept the commission, escort you... and your guard to Lenny. Can you please introduce? What about your identity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green-haired woman indulged and replied: "I will introduce myself first, I am Lily; Maggie. The one who passed out is Your real employer... Well, you can call him Mr. Alpha. Our destination is Lenny, with a very dangerous and important task, and you can tell everyone when it is safe."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In my bluntness, Mr. Alpha’s pseudonym is hard to believe." The female pastor stepped forward and retorted, "Is there any secret mission here that can’t be said? If you don’t Trust us, don't hire us. We don't have that 10,000 gold pounds."<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean, say our mission in the case of someone who may not have died, or have eavesdropped magic items? I don't think this is a good idea. At least, let you The magician first checks the bodies of all the enemies." Lily; Maggie did not hesitate to go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Namlock, I think Miss Margaret’s analysis is correct. We should first clean up here and then go to a safe place. Enemy The reinforcements may come at any time." The middle-aged man went forward and whispered to the female pastor whose face had begun to turn white. Reeve had to turn his head and some angry back to his mount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh... okay." Renee hurriedly used the magic of "detecting magic effects" to let his vision enter the state of detecting magic effects. After enduring the bloody smell, after checking the suspicious body near the carriage, she remembered the previous blocking team and ran back to the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw the reticing Parker; Tap has been there to check: the young assassin stared at the burning holes in the body and was groaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pike, you have come first. Is there anything suspicious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assassin will The hand reached into the burnt place of the body, touched it, sniffed, and the expression on the face changed. He stood up fiercely, facing Yanika, revealing a somewhat stiff smile. The girl suddenly stopped: she was the first time she saw the young man laughing. She used to think that he would not laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very good, I am... admire you. You are an expert, Wei Lun... Hey... Miss."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words are stuttering, but very sincere. He tried very hard to call out the last name chosen by Renee, and also deliberately added a title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Renee thanked her, and began to look for suspicious magic items. After destroying a suspicious brooch, she also saw the wound that was penetrated by the flame and reacted violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Experts...?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experts praised by young assassins have only one meaning. What he praised was not her technique of using magic, but the technique of her killing. He is praising her as an expert in killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one on the ground was killed by a light ball, glare, or the attack of a handsome angel - they all died from the full flame arrow . Yanika’s legs were soft and she sat on the beach. The most prestige is not necessarily the most effective, and the most striking is not necessarily the most dangerous... For these people, the most dangerous thing is her. A murderer that even the professional assassin praises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who can tell me... Should I be happy to hear this compliment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "But you can't let your companions see that you are a raw. You can't."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different voices echoed repeatedly in her heart. She mechanically ruined all the badges that issued suspicious auras and followed the team south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun was already slanting, the restless adventurers finally returned to the blockade line. With the insistence of the new employer, the team chose the fastest way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stop first." Xiu Lan blocked the team. "We must first make a hard battle, or else we will be taken away from the theater." Uncle, are you ready?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Prepared.” Jeter; Nitton magically pulled out a large gauze dipped in blood, “ I think the effect will be good... Who is coming? I think Miss Wei Lun will have the best effect. It may be a bit uncomfortable and bear with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Renee looked up from the sluggish state of horses: "Ah? What are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a little thing... it’s good soon. "Uncle's face was hung with a sly smile, and he took the pungent gauze and walked over." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After completing this final preparation, the group made a downcast look and walked into the town. The defensive soldiers immediately greeted them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a mercenary. Will it be too early to come back? Don’t be lazy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "There was someone in our team who was injured and went back to treatment. I met a very vicious bandit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jet; Nitton showed the team accepting The temporary epaulettes obtained during the mission also showed his sincere and honest face. The guard glanced at the innocent Shenika shoulder and the bloody bandage on her right arm, and with a sympathetic expression on their passport, they waved their hands and waved their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some hands [... Thank you, we went."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the thank you, a group of seven people pretended to be leisurely and passed the town. Just out of the town, "Lily; Maggie" went down and took out a lot of horseshoes with gray luster from the small box tied on the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone, we must speed up the journey now. The other person is aware that the ambush is not coming back on time, and will definitely go to check; by then we will never be able to It’s four o’clock in the afternoon. We’re going to rush to the fifth militia division before they find out that it’s impossible to check out – we have to cross the Shonson intersection and rush to Lenny before the 27th.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shensen intersection?!" Uncle Jett, who is familiar with geography, immediately spoke. "That is nearly two hundred kilometers away. Can you arrive within today?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It won't be too reluctant, because I brought the 'tired horseshoe'. Let's put it now. Use the horses that don't get tired, run all the way to midnight. We can check in at the hotel at Sham Sin Road. It will be safe until then. Please let everyone go all the way." The green-haired woman throws up the horseshoe in her hand. "The knight over there, please trouble you. Most people in your team don’t seem to have anything to the horse. . Law "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Xiu Lan Somewhat taken aback, dismounted, a little reluctantly took the pile of horseshoes. Parker; Tapp also jumped off without saying a word - this dumb young man was unexpectedly very good at caring for horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that the control of the team has been stolen at once..." Seeing this scene, disguised as a wounded person, Renee The heart smiled and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have heard her words, or she has seen the meaning of her heart from her expression, and she is also arrogant with her. The horse was underground. Almost as the female priest's riding boots touched the dust, her right index finger had pointed to the nose of Miss Maggie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before you hurry, tell us about your purpose. Unexpectedly being chased, inexplicably involved us. Finally, I hired us with a lot of money. What are you doing? Why are you targeted? Who are our enemies?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sorry, we can't say now, we may be predicted to be magically positioned. I will tell you after the sacred magical array is arranged at the Shensen intersection." Lily of Green Hair answered with a steady tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then if I said, so incomprehensible, we don't want to pick it up? Your commission is contrary to our destination." Not showing weakness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, but we have no choice. I believe that the opponents will come in time to collect the corpses for their companions and send them including the prophet and the detective. The search team. I am very sorry for the fact that I am tired of everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lily apologized on the face, not very sincerely explained. Her words seem to reveal the meaning: I am the employer now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reeve’s face turned dramatically dramatically in a moment, and a few blue veins floated on her forehead: “And the guards just now? You urged us to pass so quickly, Is it for them to leave the records we passed together? It’s really deliberate. Sorry, we’re afraid of not accepting your entrustment for our own security, even if there is such a high reward.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a change in the faces of several people when they heard the words of the pastor. Xiu Lan quickly installed the last horseshoe in his hand, hesitated, and seemed to want to say something, but in the end he did not speak. The green-haired woman bit her lip with a slight surprise, like a commander who had unexpectedly counterattacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have the freedom to imagine any situation, Miss. But now the situation is here, we are already sitting on the same boat. I have provided The method, hired you, now we have to avoid the pursuit of the opponent together. I don't see the time and necessity we have argued here. As for the reasons we are being chased, I will tell you when it is safe. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...!" Reeve; Namlock seems to want to continue to argue for the control of the team; at that moment, Lily; Maggie The eyebrows twitched slightly, and the eyes made a slight change. Her right hand used the weakest movement to make a few clicks in the air. Her movements were so slight that almost no one noticed - except for Renee, who has been watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change in the pupil was reflected in Reeve; in the eyes of Namlock, she tilted her head slightly and took a short breath—the attitude changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems to make sense to you. Then I will let you go this time, wait until the intersection of Shensen and ask again. Let's go!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that the influence of that magic? This woman... in the end?" The girl who had a keen sense of magic nodded secretly. I don't know why, she feels that it is not the time to inform her companions...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know when, Jeter; Nitton is close to her horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Weilun, the bandages on your arm can be removed. Let me help..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's a thank you." Renee smiled and shrugged her shoulders with a bandage: "This dress is ridiculous, and the bloody smell is uncomfortable... Why should I do this? "Things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I saw your hand shaking all the time." Jeter threw those bandages aside, "hope that this will make your attention Moved from the middle of the matter. The first killing can be like this, it is already very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not the first to kill..." Reflexively refuted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The kid can't see it, I can see it. Depart!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie A special whip, the horse seems to start to indulge in the madness of seeing the carrot hanging on the stick. Under the influence of "tired horseshoes", their eyes are filled with ** that should only belong to human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening of December 23, the Lenny Joint Parliament Building<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clock is approaching 5 pm. The temporarily reconstituted parliament finally reached their legal first leave. Today's issue is over. Members are separated by party and faction and talk about the gossip one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have already arrived at Lenny, why didn't you hold a briefing? We have sent people to summon the generals."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably the relationship near the year-end holiday, even Wiener; Betsy should enjoy life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Unlike Radz; Govar, we are a conservative star, but I really like to enjoy life, I am afraid it is not 'a little bit'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look In this case, the special meeting should be dragged to the 27th."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the members of the parliament chatted about topics that were not very healthy and not important, the speaker The raft slammed the silent bell on the rostrum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gentlemen, the final agenda of the 91st session of the Republic of Our Republic is coming to an end. If there is no urgent agenda, we will be on the 27th and 28th. The annual summary meeting was held, and then the first phase of the 66th year began on January 3 of the following year. A lot of things happened at the end of this year, but our country, our system and our freedom have been successfully maintained. Before you start a happy New Year holiday, let us hold the adjournment ceremony as usual."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the members of the parliament stood up at the same time and looked at it with a solemn look. A huge four-color cross flag in the middle of the north wall of the parliament hall. The speaker tapped it with the raft in his hand, and the already prepared military band immediately began to play. It was a majestic march. The lawmakers were mad at the rhythm of the tune and sang the song they were familiar with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forever united in the name of freedom,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great alliance will stand forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Republic of the Union will surely cross the times,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All citizens will be proud of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long live, our free country,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
