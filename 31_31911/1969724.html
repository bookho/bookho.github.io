In this stage of stalemate, if the defenders still have sufficient supplies, the battle will be extended almost infinitely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sacred evangelism, the greatest victory and the most tragic failure are such battles: under the great army of the army Finally, in the counterattack of the reinforcements or the defenders, they attacked and defended the situation. After a thousand miles, the soldiers would not return one until the two sides never had the strength to attack the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the Master of the sorcerer personally invites to come to God, but even a small mango garden can not break through, then we can win? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you still remember the defeat of Tianfu? I remember that when I became king, I wanted to vote in the right way. The result was also defeated under the strong city of Cao'an. Needless to say, the pseudo-Gangnan army was one of the empty in this battle..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such rumors began to spread among the middle-level monks, in those Recovering the giant deer spreads more quickly than the less enthusiastic monks. To make matters worse, the youngest and brightest of all the monks, the youngest ones, were the first to shake. These people are also the fastest group to accept the new thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dinner time, the monks began to put their suicides on the magic net, apologizing to their teachers, saying that I am afraid I can no longer continue for the masters of light. Contributed. Taoist scholars are busy completing their final writings or writing their own personal collections. Many private letters are exchanged through old-style encrypted communication or magic such as thousands of miles. Although it is impossible to confirm the content, everyone knows that it is dangerous information that cannot be transmitted through the open magic net. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Naturally, there are also countless informants rushing to the military corps responsible for the garrison, reporting their own enemies, the right or the insulting boss’s dissent. This countless rumors eventually came together on the desk of the traitor. In the regime of the Yellow Dojo, which is a combination of politics and religion, the rape order is equivalent to the religious judge of the sacred Coman Empire plus the supervision of the Eastern Empire, and the rape order is the high-ranking faculty of the commander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the good side, the sorcerer is still in the sky, but from the bad side... the heart is shaken. There is absolutely no possibility to call a yellow god thunder again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reasonable to say that he should report these thoughts to the teacher’s college as soon as possible. people. However, even if I was raped, I received a promise from the opposite side. Although the Guardian Army still has a huge advantage, in the subconscious, even the traitor has begun to believe that the battle will be fully won. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a solitary light emitting a yellow blaze, Jia Lin Deng selected a secret report of his subordinates. Like most Murrayman monks, Jia Linguang does not like pure magic lights. This kind of lighting tool, which is widely used in the countries of Koman and Elf, does not have much temperature, but has a colorful light, which always reminds him of the unlucky fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although his font size is "Pro Light," he prefers a long fire. It is also the illumination provided by the magic, which can provide more warmth and deterrence, and can also be used to burn off excess paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old monk will be able to align the source of the message with his own memory, or pass the report that is no longer needed on the light, to the flame, Throw into the pottery basins next to them and let them burn out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not until the first gongs of the camps that the first gongs and drums sounded, and Jia Lin’s lights realized that the sky was clear. He grabbed more than 20 reports left in the last, rolled into the paper tube of the folding, walked out of his barracks, and quickly rushed to the handsome flag of Zhang Futu with the guards. He was physically strong and not like a year-old. Ten people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The West Coast’s Guardian Army’s right-wing 70th Battalion commander has gathered, and Zhang Fu’s body sits above the handsome position, listening to the horse standing at the top of the first place. The deputy commander of the emergency department arranged the offensive today. Generally speaking, the division does not intervene in the following command, he only approves the actions of the generals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The attack is the responsibility of the above eight battalions. The avant-garde is responsible for the 16th battalion just now. Can the parties have objections?"<br /><br /> Since the reintroduction of Zhang Futu with the East Coast Guards, the military meeting of Deputy Minister Ma has become much more elegant. From time to time, he will consult with his subordinates. Of course, no one will openly disagree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than one-third of the leaders will be led together, took over the arrow and turned away. The generals who did not receive the order stayed in place, waiting for the sergeant to order the disbanding of the people to return to their camp to deploy defense. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, even if the Jia Lin lamp has never actually taken the soldiers, you can hear the difference in the distribution of daily combat orders. The troops that have been out of the game are no longer the troops that have been well-trained, well-trained, loyal, and have actual combat experience in the previous two days. They are troops that have not suffered much in five days, or who have played before but have no apparent consequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurricane. The old man commented on this in his heart, and quietly lowered the victory of the whole army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all the generals of the military had left, Jia Lin’s lamp took the file to the front. Before he waited for him to speak, Zhang Futu first spoke up: "What do you think of today's battle, a friend of the lamp?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher did not ask him the file in his hand. Things, this made Jia Lin’s lamp a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The poor road did not take the soldiers, dare not rumor. But it should be a safe tactic to escort the elf mercenaries to build the artillery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jia Lin Deng took a moment to answer and answer in a tentative tone. His age is actually much larger than that of Zhang Futu, but he has always been awed by the sorcerer who seems to be dying at any time in front of him - because he rarely guesses the idea of ​​the sergeant, the Taiping The ruler of the Tao seems to have no idea what is common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is safe? Just eat meat, I will go to the bones. Since there is no meat on the opposite side, let the outsiders go to the bones." Several swindlers and guards, the sergeant stood up without any scruples and laughed and said, "This is the elite soldier we left behind to defend the country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The sect of the Qing dynasty!" Zhang Futu's statement made Jia Lin's lamp horrified. He hurriedly spoke out, "This kind of words will be passed to Ma Shuai and the ministries will be in the ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This seat knows." Zhang Futu used two fingers to pinch the wooden sword he wore. "This is the wartime, it is the time of employing people. Do not be happy! Let's say, how many people have been resentful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Fu's voice is like thunder, just like his previous day When I called the thunder, the look was normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, the traitors made the adults unable to take care of these words and how many people would be embarrassed, but he knew that he had already fought two battles. He hurriedly lowered his head and pulled out the file in the copper tube and slowly unfolded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The believers and sympathizers of the Hengqu Emperor converged for the day before, but they have intensified from the previous night, and they spread the rumors about your body. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Imagine." Zhang Futu's voice was loud, but he couldn't hear the anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jia Linguang rolled up the piece of paper, crossed the paragraph and picked up the paragraphs more relevant to the current situation and continued: "And in the past few days, The thief's monk, through the communication technique of Hongyi, collected intelligence on the 'Magic Road Network', contacted the battalions with particularly severe damage and the battalions with particularly good strength, spreading the rumors that swayed our army and loyalty." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Futu Shen Shendao said: "Is serious damage to the damage, is it to persuade the strength is good? The people in the Heng channel are very aware of greed and fear." I am obsessed, this is that they advocate the integration of the three religions. The 'nutrients' that are drawn from Buddhism are not the same. The younger son of Xiao Nizi is young and has a lot of rules."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tentatively read another paragraph: "What's worse is that some battalions have begun to secretly prepare red flags. We don't know which camps, but the red cloth with the military caravan has been snapped up for various reasons. We It is time to start cleaning up those forces that are already unstable, or to consume them on the front line of the enemy. According to the aggregated news, the poor believe that the following officers are particularly suspicious -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go to the road, you'll stop here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man with deep eye socket suddenly interrupted him and waved his hand Dao: "The military mind is so, further orders can only make them rebel early."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, these are also carefully selected by you, and they are all sinful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jia Lin Deng’s body is cold, his knees are soft, hehe underground. "The sacred sect, absolutely, no such thing... the loyalty of the poor road, the sun and the moon can be learned!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not saying you. That layer All the traitors have their own positions. In this huge Guardian army, who has no fellow countrymen, classmates, who have not played together several times or friends who are willing to vote? Who has no rivals? And the interests of oneself? The incitement and rumors like this are circulated among the hearts of the people, pointing to personal lusts. Who can avoid them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poor Going back, it must be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Taoist priests who ruled all the Taoists and succeeded the great cause of the four great masters coughed twice and shook their heads. "You don't have to be like this. Jia Daoyou, do you think that the original victory was actually pulled back and down by the opposite side, which is really frightening? Do you think that the two sides are familiar with the scene?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eye is familiar...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jia Lin Deng subconsciously Zhang complex soil, then, eyes still full of confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is just like we were against the decaying cross-drainage divisions! They are powerful, but they have their own minds and self-interest. Just over the years, Now we are the one who is full of selfish desires! Jia Daoyou, can you still remember when we first met at Qingniu? At that time, you and I agreed to squander the hypocrisy of this world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t dare or forget."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the mouth said so, it also bowed, but Jia Lin’s heart still has The voice is whispering in a low voice: But it’s already this time, and what is the use of these empty words about the right way? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If all the people can be united, why are they afraid of Hongyi? If my generals, thorns, princes, and rites are not like this, everyone is intrigued Excessive, how can there be so many gaps for the enemy to use? These energies for calculating the interests of the people, even if only three points on the right track, will not be like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone of Zhang Futu’s words made Jia Lin’s lamp shudder – it seemed to have foreseen the tone of failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Zhang Futu’s Taoist repairs and insights...he said so... Jia Linguang did not dare to continue thinking about it. Although he has already buried a retreat in the opposite direction, he does not really believe that the tens of thousands of people who have only two weeks of grain and grass can withstand the army of more than ten thousand Wei Dao! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sect of the sect is not to be out of this arrogant language! We still have a large army, even if some small attempts to make chaos, they must be like the former deputy The squad! The poor roads have indeed identified the battalions that may be rebellious -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What you said is that things may not reach the worst level. Let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Futu's eyes flashed a touch of gold and looked at the enemy's position. His eyes seemed to see through the layers of the army, and the morning mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's wait and see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep and clear voice of Zhang Futu makes Jia Lin Deng It is full of cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, even he himself decided to wait for the opportunity to join the ranks of traitors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he does not know, in this decision, there are some points that are the fear of Zhang Futu, and some are the fear of the failure of the Weidao Army. ——<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps both fears are there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the greater fear he did not say. Even dare not say anything to himself, he can only meditate in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If even my shake is already in the expectation of Zhang Futu?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Futu It seems to be just a madman who is completely ignorant of his powers and completely ignores his own and other people's lusts – but he is, after all, the top caster who has ruled the entire world of peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of future did he see? This thought is lingering in the heart of Jia Lin’s lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but follow Zhang Fu’s gaze, but he couldn’t see anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the small mango garden that is still moving, there are also the Guardians who have begun to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today it seems to be a cloudless, sunny day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same day in the morning, the Grand Prix will fight for the sixth天<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joint Military Camp<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where the battle is in the west of Puzhou, if the river is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the southwest of Ruoshui River, the eight states, from the "Yangzhou" of the Qianlong Cape, finally the "Shengzhou" of the Qingniu Mansion. Their names are linked together, that is, the “karma of karma and the pilgrimage of the people” on the southwest road of the Taiping Road. Puzhou is in the middle of this southwest road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These eight words are not from the doctrine of Taiping, but the teachings of Buddhism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary Buddhism, one of the three pillars of Eastern civilization, originated from a small country in the ancient Eight States, "the Bodhi tree of the Buddha's enlightenment" - This "enlightenment" is naturally a saying of the Taiping Road - although it is not everywhere, there are always four or fifty trees within the eight states. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, there are still Buddhist temples within the Murrayman countries, but only a small group of people still believe in this ancient religion, and their beliefs are not so much Closer to the teachings of the Buddha, it is better to say that it is closer to the magic of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The replacement of Buddhism in the hearts of the people is the yellow towel that is determined to wash away all the unfair things in the world - commonly known as the "right way." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two armies fighting outside Puzhou, whether they are from the Hengjiang Army in the provinces of Haixi or the Weidao Army from the Qingniu, almost everyone believes right way. Of course, the commanders of both armies are convinced that defeating the opponent is the goal of their own operations, and they also believe that the opponent has turned away from the right path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——In addition to a handful of foreign teams from distant countries that were involved in this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army with the least fighting reason is the backbone of this war. If there are no such foreigners, it may be over when Zhang Futu calls the thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth day of the test was a violent assault on the West Bank Taiping Army, but it was smashed in front of the Puzhou reinforcements, which were also the new force. Soon the frantic assault became a powerless assault, and then became a forced assault under the threat of the superintendent, and finally became a tacit truce. That night, the Guardians of the Guardian Army worked late into the night, and the fire of the righteous road burned all night, burning a priest and seven monks who could not enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth day is a real bloody battle. After forcing the Puzhou Water Camp to withdraw from the battle, the Guardian Army transferred reinforcements from the left wing of the East Coast that was not engaged in combat. The largest offensive was invested by 4,000 people, and the drums of the Taoists were connected until the river. Even the line of defense in front of the mango garden was once broken. Between the main house and the hunting house, the lead shot of the gun sprinkled the blood of the two armies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since then, the Guardian Army has finally found no more troops to carry out a decisive attack of this size. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you see the enemy people, everyone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth day of the campaign Early in the morning, it was not a routine operational meeting that was forced to convene urgently. The young Superintendent of the Intresury Army stood on the command post and pointed the distant smoke with the telescope in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his right wrist, he can see two scars with white new skin, which is the mark left by the hard work of the previous two days. Fortunately, as a defensive party, most of the wounded officers of the United Army can still wait for the priests to come as long as they are not on the spot, and seal their bloody wounds, so that the limbs that were interrupted by lead and flying swords will be re-opened. Go back to the torso. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we don't do anything, two hours later, they will have a new artillery position. Not only the three heavy artillery, the rest Hundreds of light and heavy artillery can also directly bombard our defense line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Major Nermen Soledon was calm and calm, but in his voice Still can hear a trace of exhaustion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I need volunteers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although talking about volunteers, his His eyes have already swept a number of battalions, even the chief officer, the gendarmerie, the seamen, the dragon gunners, and of course the cross-drain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I need volunteers who lost less strength in yesterday's defensive battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Some of the people who were swept by his eyes were quite chest-high, some of them avoided their eyes, and they seemed very nervous. The number of people in the meeting was much less than before the outbreak of the Puzhou war, but some new young people hanged in the queue with temporary ranks embroidered with colored cloth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know how many people have lost in the battles of the past two days, and you know it yourself. There should be no need to report it, everyone." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After these days of fighting, the door has changed. He is no longer the one who has been deliberately avoiding the command position to avoid the suspect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the loss of Major General Huo on the third day, on the fourth day, the United Army was cut off by the avid enemy and lost the left wing. Mozhou Taishou and Jiezhou Taishou. Now whether it is the Free Army or the Cross-Army, everyone -- at least all the commanders -- knows that there must be a unified command system to prevent the various components of the Allied Forces from being rescued by each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was also intended to push this responsibility to Colonel Cliff, who had a higher rank, but Colonel Cliff just stunned Zhang Shiyi and said hurriedly I can't command the crossbar army. In the two-day and three-night defensive operations, he only slept for four hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...So, the following ministries that I have ordered are ready for attack. The third wing of the left-wing dragon gun, the fifth company of the dragon gun, Zhuhai One company, the eleventh company of Zhuhai, Bizhouwei, Fanzhouwei, Northwest Weiwei; right wing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the door may be polite, But after more than 130 gendarmes have been executed, he will no longer waste time. If you waste a few words, the enemy may even make the basement more dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi stood by his side and translated the door-to-door command into Oriental. Whenever Nami said the troops in the crossroads, she would translate and point her eyes to the named commander. Everyone knows that the big lady of Zhang's Zhang is not volunteering to be a translator when she is a translator. Her personal translation means an attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until, she heard the end of the endurance command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the counterattack force of more than 3,000 people, the goalkeeper crossed his arms to his chest, and his right hand pressed near the table on the left chest. Close your eyes and your expression seems to be remembering something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The oriental military book that my teacher once told me said: defensive is impossible to win, counterattack can win. Blindly defensive words forever It is not enough. Only counterattack can make a limited force play a greater role."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to this passage, Zhang Shiyi glanced and squinted for a moment before he matched this passage with the Oriental Military Books she had read. She reveals a expression that "I feel that you have completely translated this paragraph correctly" and continued to translate the scalp: "Rosie Taixu cited 'grandson' 曰: invincible, defending; victor, attacking. ", attack is more than enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door open your eyes, return to reality, continue: "Now is this turning point. We have already arrogant arrogance After hitting it back, this counterattack will once again determine the outcome of the victory. Therefore, this counterattack will be led by me personally. You have to have any personal grievances against me, but you can solve it after the war; but now, I need all of you. The power of attacking the troops and preparing for the battle within fifteen minutes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In person?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi stopped the translation and stared blankly at the door. Nami Soleton nodded lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big lady of Zhang’s Zhang Heng did not hesitate this time and completed the rest of the translation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can defeat the enemy's attack plan, the morale of the Guardian will collapse. Therefore, this counterattack will be led by me and Lord Sonnemon." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the turn of the door to the big eyes. Zhang Shiyi grabbed his wrist and put his body up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the time of our attack, the defense of the camp is pleased with everyone. Let the troops prepare, time is a quarter of an hour, disband!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Zhang Da quickly translated the order of the door, and added herself to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the protest against the door, she has already explained: "If you fight in the counterattack, then I can no longer command the Free Army, we must Will die. If you don't go, the counterattack fails, we just delay the time of demise. So why don't we both go together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I opened my mouth and suddenly laughed: "It sounds like what I said three nights ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's relax. Today is a sunny day, Even if Zhang Futu is recovering, it may not be able to take the lives of both of us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, she loosened the arm of the door and began to wear handcuffs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, your horse seems to have died yesterday. Do you need me to borrow a new one?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door knocked on the sapphire node hidden in the clothes with a finger, trying to find an oriental idiom as an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want an idiom that can explain the meaning of 'please give me the best horse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Annie's memory instantly came up with the answer: "The answer has been searched. Please follow me: Gansu Iris."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know why After hearing this idiom, Zhang Shiyi suddenly laughed and almost laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the laugh, she lifted her chin and patted her chest and said, "Since you are all attached to the tail, then today’s counterattack will be handed over to me." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main battlefield central Sen Huwei Nearby <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The freedom of the Freedom Army’s representative It’s up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distant snoring came from the air, which is the signal that the Guardian Air Force has begun to attack. Compared to the previous two days, there have been many fewer cockroaches in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough to come here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiawen Alvarez from Immediately raised his head, he glanced at the flag of the new seventeen elf cubits (the oriental style combined with one foot and six feet) high by the flag bearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the local officer did not dare to explain to her the meaning of the word "森胡卫". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this banner, it was a batch of extra supplies and military supplies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of military and rewards, and they have used dozens of horses and horses to pull dozens of cars - converted into the army of the Sanctuary, even the army of the official army. It also tops the income of the entire army for five months. When the Green Cattle House is serious, the accumulation of the millennial state is not a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have known for a long time that this unexpected military sergeant is not good." The elf female guards shook the whip in the air and issued an order. The team stopped moving forward and set up the artillery base on the spot! The Chinese army accelerated to join the former team, and it was necessary to make an estimate by not having reinforcements around it! Just hold this wave... No, even if you give up the already built artillery, you can just keep it. The troops will slowly retreat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judgment she made was far more conservative than the previous few days, and the staff and aides who were conservative to her side expressed disagreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not so? Even if the offensive three days ago, the enemy could not attack our camp. You really believe that the other side has such a soldier. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Again, for this advancement, Ma’s deputy is not mobilizing the Eighth Battalion on the front line, and there are 16 battalions on the flank? Even if the enemy is opposite Strong, can we still break through the three or five thousand people who are not in front of us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pure-blooded female elf shakes her head and explains: "If they need to break through, That's definitely not possible. But... they don't necessarily need to break through."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to break?" A quasi-elf officer asked strangely, "Don't they Is there any new kind of magic that can drive our camps directly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, they don't need any new magic. I hope my hunch is wrong." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiawen replied, looking around, looking for a team of artisans and immediately ordering them to go The establishment of local gun predetermined barrier erected tall podium. The defensive magic of this podium is personally strengthened by the female guards. The ordinary shells will not penetrate it, and will only be deflected to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This podium was built in two quarters of an hour. When the podium was built, she just saw the moment when the first line of defense on the front line was cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forces used by the Free Army to counterattack are not many, but they are also divided into two armies, each with more than a thousand people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What’s even more frightening is that this counterattack army has two unusually sharp targets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Liberal Army officers in dark red one-sleeve uniforms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heiress of the Zhang family in the cross-strait of the goose-yellow war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two rode a pair of almost identical twin silver horses, each led a winged martial arts into the Guardian Pioneer Camp. Behind them, they followed the officers of the 30th and 40th, and at the back they were the infantry who trod in the trot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clothes of the two of them are not the brightest colors, but in this cloudless sunny day, the two of them are in the left and right arms. The spearhead position is unusually eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiawen Alvarez frowned. In the eyes of women and civil servants, the route they chose to enter the army seems to be completely incompetent, even if the barbarians of the New World are afraid that they will not be so reckless...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "To win! The enemy commander will lead the troops, how can there be fools from the front? If you cut in, you can attack a battalion with all your strength, but you will be besieged by three sides!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officers sent by the Guardian Army couldn’t help but sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I would like to ask General Ding, which camp is that? Who was originally under command? What is the record?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "General Lei, the battalion is the spearhead of this attack, is one of the deputy battalion of the deputy horse of Ma, the martial arts will be strong, will not easily lose to the Hengqu counter army..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing Jiawen’s further questioning, the Ding general stunned and then opened his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you say...this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also realized the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The escort of Ma’s law is indeed brave and good. Faced with more than 70 experienced and free-spirited Freedom Army and Hengjun military officers, they actually supported two quarters of an hour before they lost. Among them, less than a quarter of the people turned back and retreated, and did not impact the array of several other battalions when retreating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the three battalions around, and the four battalions placed in the second and third lines of defense did not have an active reinforcement or an attack on the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining seven battalions of the Guardian Army at the forefront are just trembled and watched the main camp of the horse’s urgency, and were defeated by Naimen and Zhang Shiyi. Two battalions have been loosened and retreated. The squares showed huge gaps between each other and could no longer seal the entire plain along the west bank of the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides this battalion as the core, the remaining battalions are not succumbing to the previous record, or deliberately fighting to preserve strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before these camps, Nami Soleton and Zhang Shiyi led the left and right forces and reunited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won the enemy right wing for you, Miss Zhang. This is a hard bone, which camp to play next?" Two broken konjac arrows, panting, "Do you want to kill the elf artillery directly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi shakes the horse and makes his silver and a half The Holy Blood Horse walked with his twin brothers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, we don't have to play this for a while. I didn't say it before, will you give me the battle today? Next is my job. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi took advantage of the horse, a pair of boots on the eyes, from the beginning of the long, right hand pointing directly to the side of Jiawen Alvarez Zhang Liudu, the flag, treble: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Being in the heart of heaven and earth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Everyone lives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the sacred journey."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Opening peace for the world. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire battlefield seems to be quiet. The officers of the Naim and the Free Army looked a little puzzledly at the appearance of Miss Zhang Da’s strange Eastern poetry, and the Wei Daojun opposite did not enter the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the four sentences of the Hengqu. It is the core of the concept of the Hengping Road." The voice in the first node of the magic net, without any emotion Naimen explained the mysterious oriental characters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the purpose of our Hengduan faction. We do not believe that there will be a perfect Taiping world in the future, and we do not believe that there has been such innocent Taiping in the past. The rule of governance. What we believe is now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officers of the Hengjun Army and the Taoist scholars held their breath and listened to Zhang Shiyi’s cross. The canon was re-appeared in the declaration of the Central Plains of the Yellow Turban. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some factions believe that the past is the most perfect, so they pursue retro. Some factions believe that the future is the most perfect, so they pursue longevity. We have a cross channel Do not pursue retro and do not pursue longevity, we are pursuing the present!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Zhang Shiyi reverberates on both sides of the Ruoshui River by increasing the volume of the Tao. Because today is a sunny day, the sound sounds slightly hollow, but it is even louder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because now is the day! Every now is the day! There is no hard battle and bloodshed in the past, no fight between us and our allies, How can there be peace and prosperity from the sky!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five-day defensive operation is enough to allow the owners of the West Coast Guards to fight with the United Army at least once. The period of time is also enough for Zhang Shiyi and the people of Zhang’s branch to contact the camp or Tudor of each camp. When Nami and his Freedom Army served as the mainstay on the front line, the Hengjun Army used their familiarity with the peace of the country to prepare silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are greedy, fearful, and especially powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhang Shiyi knows the fighting power of each battalion in front of him, knows the fear and greed in their hearts, knows that they intend to retain their strength and know their intrigue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will also separate it from it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pulled out one from her arms Let the arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The order is going down! Everyone, for a cross-channel... no."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the arrow Stayed in the air for a moment. At this moment, she decided to change the wording. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Transfer orders, for the peace of the world--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no hesitation in the arrow On the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the track on the arrow light up and flashes a touch of gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"-- raise the red flag!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, this arrow turns into the sky Great fireworks! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the peace of the world, the princes, raise the red flag!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Raise the red flag !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red flag representing the Hengqu Zong, magically raised in the hands of Zhang Shiyi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the remaining seven battalions, three are from Fuxi and Yuanfeng. In these three battalions, next to the yellow flag representing the Taiping Road, the red flag representing the Intres and the Republics rose in the midday sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there were the sixteen battalions of the sideguards, and seven of them also put down their weapons, or they raised the red flag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is staring at it all. When he was fully commanding the defensive battle, Zhang Shiyi did not seem to do much, but quietly prepared for the current battle situation -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the horse's urgency, these teams with low or unreliable combat power were put on the front line, and Zhang Shiyi used these troops to make a perfect reversal at the moment of the front line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment of reversal has arrived, and the tide of retreat has returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magic Network not only brings tactical advantages, it also brings strategic advantages. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a large number of middle and low level and even advanced Taoist users in the Taoist team felt that the situation had reversed, the situation on the entire battlefield would really reverse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An organization is made up of thousands of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No power is stronger than the human mind itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of ​​"to lose" once spread, it will become shaken, and then become a real defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do we have a red flag?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Change color with the Tao! Replace the yellow flag !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless red flags that sweep across the right wing of the Taiping Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red tide rises and sweeps over, until the waters of the river, a red projection on the entire river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reddish reflection in the eyes of the left-wing officers and men of Hedong, their faces are all pale! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let the tides separate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi re-sit back on the horse and put the hand The red flag was thrown to the flag bearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
