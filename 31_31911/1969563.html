			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard Calendar June 12, 1665 Southwestern Tradewinds Level 4<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the initial connection After the war, the anti-private plundering ship "Kleon Emperor" of the Sassen Navy and the "Quasi Angel" of the Intres private frigate re-entered the state of "throwing rocks to each other". At this time, it has been 30 minutes since the first exchange of fire between the two sides. In the previous battle, the second ship "black trojan" of the Intrepid squadron has become a driftwood at sea, its captain Mark; black beard was killed by gunfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of the No. 2 ship, the pirate Katzmi, who ranked eighth in the offshore rewards; Stewart did not feel sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the cost of the second ship, he has earned half of the propulsion of the enemy ship, one third of the gun door, and one quarter of the crew . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Elf Sailing Ship still holds the upper hand, there is no advantage to defending the upper hand now. It tried hard to change the shell side of the left full rudder, but could not rely on the current cross sail to turn over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirate captain thought it was worth it, and it was not himself who sacrificed it anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only four cannons that can be fired on the starboard side of the Elf ship - and there are nine doors on the port side of the Quasi-Angel, and the starboard is nothing. damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have any way to trigger?" Katzmi smiled and talked to himself, and the victory seemed to be in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he knows that the opponent has no gunner, he should smile more brilliantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boom!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deformed iron ball rotates and is deeply embedded in the coffin deck of the Emperor Kleon. The location where it fell was only five steps from a gunpowder barrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sailors were wounded by it. One of them was injured in the abdomen and the intestines flowed out. It must not be alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir?" "Captain!" "Lord Baron!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember this boat The highest commander was nearby, and the sailors and seamen were flustered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No fuss, I'm fine! Go back to my post and listen to me!" Fei Long; Letons shouted and raised his right hand, if nothing had happened The smoke in front of it. His gaze is still completely concentrated in the distant enemy ship that is being circumvented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, it looks like you are not in a good situation here, Lord Baron." Reza; Hermonte's voice was a mockery in pride. "Is it going to lose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not yet." The iron wall admiral replied coldly. "Can you please help me with a little help?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sail repairing? Simple repair, I can still do it." Reza replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it’s not a sail, but a sail." The captain smiled inexplicably. "Please take all the broken sails off, then ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of guns covered the words behind the first baron. The only female alchemist who heard the request frowned and turned back to the upper deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy lowered the mainsail and the front sail!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing such a return, Katzmi is a bit strange. Are they planning to change sails? How could this be possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to wait and see, and continue to bombard the ship that has become slower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;铛! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spear penetrates the center of the main mast of the Kleon Emperor with amazing power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good prospects!" A sailor cheered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the spear, with a long sail; the end of the sail is in the hands of the golden golem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resa grabbed the sails and launched the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"minor cre secondary creation]!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spell is over, a huge triangle White sails spread out in the wind along the ropes. That was the temporary sail that Reza's creation had just created. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, Bonnie, put that end on the main mast!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; , madam!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls quickly grabbed the sail from the third corner of the sail and tied it to the lower end of the main mast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than half a minute, a sail was set up between the main mast of the "Kleon Emperor" and the broken rear mast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Shunfeng right full rudder, z-steer! Replace the bombardment side!" The captain seized the opportunity to order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the addition of a vertical sail, the "Kleon Emperor" successfully ran the rudder to the right and drawn an "n" shaped trajectory on the sea. , moving it from northeast to southeast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faced with the "Quasi Angel" in the east, it is no longer the scarred starboard side, but the port side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elevation angle 14 degrees... No, 15 degrees, all fire!" The iron wall admirer waved heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunners and sailors skillfully adjust the parameters of the artillery, and the death and injury of their peers cannot shake their skills and will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the cannons on the port side spewed out angry iron balls almost simultaneously; after a while, the only four active light cannons on the upper deck fired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...how is it possible! Even so fast, the sails are hung up and the wind is adjusted..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kazmi was too late to marvel and feel, and the situation turned sharply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bunny scorpions! Just hit the spot, and then on time! You are all long guns, how can you not even win the broken ship!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One round, two rounds. After two rounds of shelling, Katzmi’s smile has completely turned into anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, boss! Left three, left seven, two shots were hit, no one can substitute!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The left five bombs are ......!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Confirm the battlefield one!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirate's knuckles are pinched and try to suppress the urge to pull the samurai sword from the back. He found that even though the number of artillery pieces was almost the same, his gunner's hit rate was significantly lower than his opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are still a few gun positions on the port side?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss, only two "!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard, bastard, bastard, bastard! Is the opponent's gunner a god?! Winds off the sail, attack with a starboard artillery! The other is A cross-sailboat loses to them on steering force, and the children and grandchildren will be ashamed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hand holds the second kit, keeps on Trembling. Is it tearing or not tearing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally made the decision...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the black smoke on the port side of the enemy ship, In a hurry, the wind fell off the wind, and Fei Long finally breathed a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember the days of being the gunner..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was in 1571 Diza. At that time, he was still a young elf. He was the gunner for the first time. He died in the inner sea with the empire's squid battleship... The blood from the soldiers and the shredded wood left by the battleship really changed the sea. colour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is also the final glory of the Sailboat. After that, this costly vessel no longer meets the needs and was slowly replaced by armed commercial sailboats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still remembers that there were 10 guns at that time, even the main ship of the fleet. At the moment, the ship carrying 20 guns is just a frigate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The times are changing fast..." Ferron sighed. His first-class baron title was also won in the sea battle of Diza. After that, his position gradually rose to the captain, but the title was no longer able to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boom!" seems to be in order to meet his sigh, the pirate ship has just turned over the starboard was completely hit by the previous round of shelling, explosion, fire, popping out Gray smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visually, only three water columns rise from the nearby sea - this proves that all the remaining shells hit the other's hull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two...no, four...seven, seven...eight guns! Eight gun positions confirmed!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;? The report of Wang’s hand was thoroughly surprised. The ability of the Iron Wall Admiral as a gunner is even stronger than the well-known gunman of the offshore fleet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"eight? Then they don't have no artillery?" After hearing this report, Ferron finally sighed: he knew he was already winning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a disappointing opponent. Give them a final blow!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was his words, I immediately fled. Seven, eight... obviously lost, what is still dead? It’s really late to escape.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Leonard was lying bored on Ferron's leather chair in the captain's room, listening to the report from the tower. Now that the position of the command hub has been transferred, the message sent here is always a late step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, the priests are here." A sailor opened the hatch and led the bishop Belber and the trainee Pastor Nopp to walk in. The faces of the two looked Not too good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you call us, Lord Baron?" The middle-aged bishop asked seriously, "I think we may be more conducive to the situation by helping the wounded on the deck." ...... Hey, where did the Baron go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf patted the hand and drove off all the seamen and sailors around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to put on the most serious expression and said: "Because the gunner was injured, the captain went directly to the deck and directed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we will treat the gunner..." The young trainee priest turned and urged to go, and the half-elf hurriedly stopped him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop. Although it is somewhat rude, for the sake of the Sacred, the Holy Empire, and the future of your Soma Principality, you must stay here, respectful protection. Lord Bishop, and Lord Ferdinand..." Leonard thought about it and seemed to be thinking about how to word it. "Or, the future Duke of Soma, His Majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two pastors froze on time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berber took a moment to mutter: "According to the agreement, this news should not be disclosed to anyone on board."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf sighed: "Do not worry, Sansen does not violate your agreement. I and the captain know this thing, just to fulfill the task, it will not be A third person knows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The reason why we stayed here... Could it be that our whereabouts have been leaked? Is this attack a The assassination of the heirs of the Soma Principality?” Bishop Belber eagerly asked, “The inheritance of the Soma Principality is related to the balance of the world and the glory of the Orthodox Church. There must be no mistakes, we cannot take any risks!” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly wait, wait a moment, there is no evidence that this is a conspiracy." Leonard shook his head and said comfortably. "This should be just an ordinary encounter." Only because the opponent’s tactics are strong, we are worried that my Highness will be affected. Spread, so just ask you to rest here "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"So what's the situation now? Is it dangerous? We didn't seem to be good before we left the upper deck..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard smiled: "Now those guys Almost basically we have been repulsed by us. It should be no danger. If there is no accident, we can immediately hear the news that the other side has steered away. Now, they should be more desperate than we are."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report that proved his judgment was sent in at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy ship steers in the wind, back in the middle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Direction?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Southeast! There is no intention to meet with the passenger ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf sighed and shook his head, saying : "The big pirate of the eighth in the outer sea has become a dog of funeral. The countermeasures of the captain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not chasing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think it's a person who claims to be an iron wall. The judgment is really conservative..." Leonard stood up and picked up his sword from the table. "As you have heard, we have won. I went to the deck to see the situation... Hey, Lord Bishop, you better follow, there should be some wounded."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about me?" Pastor Pastor... No, it should be said that Lord Ferdinand asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will stay here, this is the place on the ship that is the least accessible to the artillery. And, I have already called to protect your guard." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s just falling, he walked into the men who were extraordinarily tall and tall, each wearing a weapon like a spear or a scorpion. Silver shiny breastplate. The priests were a little surprised to see these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before this covert operation, the old duke sent Our people are the best and most loyal warriors of the Soma Principality. They can be trusted. Plus, my subordinates, what else can you worry about here? It is absolutely impregnable!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard’s face, a confident smile. This smile infected other people and everyone laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the half-elves know that the sense of uneasiness in his heart is getting stronger and stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The other party did not pursue the main ship!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As I expected. Name, really a conservative person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karben; the smile on the black robe is equally confident, and does not see the complete disadvantage of the current situation. . "The second kit should be torn open."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found a scepter with a ruby ​​in his arms, one by one, one The fireball flew out from the inside and squatted on the bow of the passenger ship, igniting the image of the bow of the angel carving the god of beauty. Angels like glamorous faces are shrouded in flames and turned into fly ash. He slammed the scepter in the other direction, and the angel's smoky smog became thicker and darker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You control the fire. Grab all the money and accessories from these noble adults, ladies, ladies... Of course, it is forbidden to undress. There is no such time now." He smiled and clap his hands and put away his scepter. "Just let them cry out for help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirates who followed him immediately rushed to the gentlemen who were full of fat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't know which step my competitors can follow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lena De rushed to the stairs leading to the lower deck, took the pace and slowly walked up the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower deck is also a mess, but better than the upper deck. The holes in the shells were scattered around the shooting port, and blood was found near the destroyed guns. The wounded soldiers have been carried away, and most of the bodies have been lifted to the side, waiting to be thrown into the sea after the end of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well. Captain Kaikawi, what?" The Iron Wall Admiral replied indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the case. I think we may need to call the reinforcements of the offshore fleet, just in case." Leonard was a little surprised to say this judgment. Calmness, "because our secret mission may be leaked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Wall Admiral turned and asked: "I originally thought that you are coming. I accuse me of being too conservative. But why do you think about calling the offshore fleet reinforcements?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A feeling...the other party’s defeat is too fast, It’s so smooth, it’s going to be horrible. It feels like we’re specifically introducing us into the set.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feron smiled scornfully: “What you mean Yes, in fact, the victory is not because of my command, but because of the enemy’s strategy. Do you want to say that these pirates who used the wind, sacrificed the No. 2 ship, and killed one third of the guns? Just hiding the strength, let me be fortunate to defeat? Is the captain of your distant sea fleet better than me? <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "! No, I did not mean" the half-elf hurried excuse, feel sad for the gap between the two. "Your command is indeed in line with your reputation. However, our mission must not fail, so we should be safer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You say These are all speculations. Or do you have found evidence of intelligence disclosure?" Ferron asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is not yet..." Leonard’s words were halfway through, slamming and gazing out of the boat; Ferron followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distant sailboat, the eye-catching black smoke rose. The black smoke fluttered with the southwest trade wind and tilted slightly toward the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain picked up the telescope and looked at the deck of the passenger ship. "They have people on the passenger ship. Those people are abandoned by their main ship, they must be desperate, and they are in the final madness. That is the signal smoke they are raising at the bow."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are the last, desperate help for their mothership? Or..." Leonard muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ning is credible, not credible." Ferron finally made up his mind and waved a sailor to convey the order. "Call the second pair to prepare the cigarette can. The highest alert level, in red."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you agree with my speculation?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I was thinking, if you are a spy, all coincidences can make sense." The iron wall admiration frowned. "Your judgment and observation are indeed It's quite powerful... Now I need to use your combat power. Is it safe to get close to the melee?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before the reinforcements arrive, the problem must be solved." The elf answered with confidence. "The sea corps can be assembled right away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Give it to you." Ferron's hand swayed in the air, "toward the north to the north thirty Degree, half sail!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the red-red smoke floated in the air, which is the highest level warning signal of the Elven Navy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elven National Sassen can proudly claim that Sanssen’s ships will come to the rescue around the entire Sansen coastline, wherever red smoke is emitted. Only they can do it - in the previous fifty years and in the next hundred years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the uninjured sea warriors gathered on the deck, and the golden figure was standing near the team, which was extraordinarily powerful. Reza stood beside Ganda, arrogant to everyone, and Anne and Bonnie bowed their heads and stood behind the owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haibing captain Leonard; Kakawi stood by the guardrail, facing the sea, facing away from everyone, the left hand pink finger kept tapping the guardrail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reporting Chief, the Haibing team has a total of 70 teams, 27 casualties, 43 people, and 43 people. Please indicate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone, I will not publish a long story." The half-elf turned and his face was more serious than ever. "This time's mission... staying in the four-team ten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
