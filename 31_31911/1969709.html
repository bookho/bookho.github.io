There is no real feeling about the reality around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new boots that have just been stolen have the smell of sewers. [Search for the latest updates]<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The East Coast Association itself is not located in the sewer, but the main entrances and exits must pass through the sewers, it is like deliberate Martyrdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a protective magic in the store, but there are no apprentices at all, but it’s just a matter of words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but such performance is enough to suppress the examiner of the East Coast Thieves Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, if the guild arranges work, it can be rejected, but at least one item must be completed each month. The cryptic words will be replaced from time to time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the back of the camel, the oriental man with a yellow cap took over the thief symbol scroll of the phase port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yellow headdress and scroll seem to be a symbol of oriental monotheistic religion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above is a general mark that can be drawn in a few strokes, as if the Chinese character is radical, fully taking into account the needs of illiterate readers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The guild whispers let them teach you a few, foreigners."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It is a member of the White Silk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, shouldn’t the magician directly qualify for advanced qualifications?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The three girls who came together were arguing for reason, but the Orientals were too lazy to raise their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is no badge certified by the Masters Association, the Guild cannot register for advanced qualifications. Do you intend to offend the Masters Association, ah?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man with a hunchback knocked at the table with an identification wand in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although not reconciled, several people still quit the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oriental is the recipient and appraiser in the guild, and it is unwise to offend him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s just a quasi-legal institution, the Thieves’ Guild is really busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a circle of three new friends, I have already mastered its structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protection Fees Branch, Patrol Branch, Intelligence Branch, Sales Club, Disciplinary Implementation Branch, Theft Branch, Robbers Branch, Fraud Branch, Sex Industry Branch...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All work that instinctively stirs up hostility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that I should not engage in these evil jobs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A variety of suspicious individuals enter and exit between different rooms and different sewer entrances and exits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is conservatively estimated, as the underground city of Intres, the thieves’ association East Coast Branch has at least hundreds of members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time, people who openly wear the black armbands of the guild can walk through the corridors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing these people, the female thieves carefully put away the disdain on their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the armband is openly worn, does the bastard really think it is the army!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen It is said that the West Coast Association has expanded to 2,000 apprentices."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They and the powers in the city council and the garrison seem to have reached an understanding."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, what is "normal"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called "normal" in her mind really exists? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still can't think of anything. Although the knowledge and analytical skills are exceptionally sufficient, there is no trace of memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking, I didn't see the magic club."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course there is no. There are thousands of people in the guild, and there are only a few wizards with badges."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mage who is born in a bright and honest manner can go to politics, can participate in the Masters Association, can open a business, can join the army ... who wants to break the law."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, sorry, not to say 'white silk' you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is the center of crime, it is also a place where people abandoned by the civilized world gather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden impulse has come to mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, do you think that if I want to engage in the main business of 'Professor Magic for Association Members', is it in line with the guild regulations?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not forbidden, but you can't afford it. Isn't Master Training going to invest a few years and thousands of tuition?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't charge so much. Do you know that there is something called 'Magic Net'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like listening to the street The wizard who opened the teaching magic called out..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is something that makes it easier for everyone to learn magic - no, it should be said that it is a professor who learns magic. Method of things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are not satisfied with your work, just create your own new job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not realize how advanced this idea was in this era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br <br><br><br><br><br >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After half a day of fighting, the gunshots in the city gradually became scarce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strips of the port are covered with red spots of stars, as if there was a bloody rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winner’s auxiliary team towed the body, and the army’s sea water washed away the blood. The staff established their own command in the warehouse of the dock. unit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hill-like supplies were transported from the city to the dock and piled up in the temporary headquarters of the independent gendarmerie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The khaki paper with the new ink scent is piled on the crates, and the military map of the phase port is deployed in the center of the warehouse. The handymen and dock workers obediently under the supervision of the soldiers, carrying the spoils that seemed to never be carried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the assets plundered from the merchants who set off the rebellion. Because the rebellion was prepared in a hurry, the insurgents did not even care about the transfer of assets. Many supervisors of shops, workshops, and warehouses still do not know that their owners have betrayed the free nations, and they have ushered in a heavily armed receiving army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young major in a red-sleeved uniform wears a newly captured horse and returns with the Guards Cavalry from the front line. As a result of personally leading the army to break through the enemy line, his body also splashed a lot of blood, exudes an inaccessible taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young gendarmerie major walked into the warehouse with the guards, and the staff members who had just been selected were a bit clumsy to read the latest battle report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naimen selected the soldiers who had read the military prep, and also had common sense on the battlefield. They formed their own staff with the excellent frontline officers, the number is much larger than the size of a gendarmerie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about 30 male staff members and 10 female staff officers. Not to mention the independent gendarmerie regiment of only 2,000 people, who commanded a freelancer full of 10,000 or 20,000 people to use it. The number of people who remain in the headquarters is about half now, and the rest are coordinating wars between the front lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The battle of the scale above the scale has occurred six times. More than 600 people have been killed, more than 1,700 people have been captured, and more than 3,000 people have been defeated and defeated. The remnants are holding their house and resisting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to this report, the surrounding Hong Kong merchants have a fear on their faces. In order to ensure safety, and to prevent them from privately venting their letters, Naimen put these people under their own command--and, of course, the elements that show off force. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only two battalions and less than 2,000 troops, but they have defeated more than 5,000 private businessmen with less than 300 casualties. From the beginning of the landing war, sweeping, encountering, street fighting, siege, this army seems to be omnipotent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its power exceeds everyone’s imagination. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there were people who had previously despised the young prosecutor who had only two reinforcement camps in front of him, no one now has this idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are only two thousand people, it is a soldier who can defeat thousands of troops in the front! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the report, Namimen sighed and shook his head in dissatisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The loss is a bit big. If it is lost in the landing battle, it will deal with that level of enemies in the upright street fighting, and there are two casualties. How many people are there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not satisfactory?! Is that the standard of the Intrepids of Intres?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People in the phase port looked at the young major with a stunned look, and the fear in the eyes was far more than the admiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of Nanimen and his officers, this loss has been unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The independent military police are not ordinary troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few months, they have been fighting against the powerful enemies many times to the last moment, and they have been slamming into the air for several days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong operation is the battalion in the last moment of the large meat grinder in Kengal-Jena-Blenheim, the iron guard is After several months of the collapse of the Lenny attack and defense, the battalion of the arrogant camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they are all reorganized from the defeated soldiers, these two battalions are undoubtedly the two main forces in the Western Army and the Lenny Army. The most experienced elite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the two major regiments with a total of up to 200,000 people, they were tempered by the war and chosen by the goddess of fortune, and two thousand people were chosen by the hundred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a force has caused more than 10% of casualties by some militia, which is unacceptable to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy has a large number of magic items, and the number of magicians is also large. Most of the casualties and disappearances are caused by chasing. If not most of their magicians There is no fighting spirit, we may have to bear more losses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A large number of magicians... Will it be the enemy of the Elf Rangers?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was frowned. If the elf dispatched an elite unit with a large number of magicians to land here, it may indicate that the enemy still ambushed a fine soldier, patiently waiting for the command of the door to reveal flaws in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I don’t think so. The magicians are not elite...how to say, it’s like the kind of blood and the People are complacent to study at the School of Magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the name of the Muse, it is the 'Firearms'. Although it is a magician, but the brain and the firearms are almost simple types."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s rude to the fire brigade. My fire brigade is a soldier who won’t break in the white-blade battle. Don’t compare it with those amateur mages?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The staff from different units have put forward their own opinions, and the door can hear the hidden competitive mentality. Fortunately, the independent gendarme is a mixed force that has been reorganized by the squadron and is carefully supplemented by the various units. There is no fellowship or friendship between the general battalion team. This kind of competition is controlled to a benign degree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the case, and the door-to-door has the opportunity to use the promotion staff and officers to adjust these means to organize their own command system. I really want to give him a well-formed, regular camp in a certain area, and he will not command it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major patted the map on the map and signaled the staff to calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, everyone is converging, saying something right. Where else is there no compromise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The Sanssen Embassy and Elf Oriental Company on Third Avenue are still recalcitrant. Lieutenant Spari led the two companies of the Iron Camp and the Magic Teaching Company to organize an offensive there."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The pursuit of the surrounding points and the cleaning work have also been arranged. The phase port local guards are reluctant or loyal and can perform these secondary tasks. The strong operation of Lieutenant Sarruzzo and his The company is carrying out the reorganization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door listened to the situation in the staff report, and nodded slightly. In this memorable first victory, the independent gendarmes joined the team as a unit and played a very good effect. The vast majority of private soldiers and mercenaries are rushing to the ground and have no determination to fight hard; occasionally several strong points of defense will be combined by several nearby companies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are still a few questions to ask the major. Where is the official headquarters of our independent gendarmerie?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen did not hesitate to answer: "This problem does not have to bother the Interlakes Council and the City Council. Expropriate all rebellious mansions and strongholds, pick the best as the command from the inside, and leave the rest as The company’s barracks.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officers, staff, and soldiers present at the scene looked at each other and cheered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After waiting for the cheers to sigh, the door was able to stand up and finished the second half of the training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the order is the same as before, it is strictly forbidden to plunder privately. Put all the spoils together, I will give you a bonus. And, not only us We must also supervise the phase of the Hong Kong Guard and the Navy. We are here to represent the Free Army headquarters in Fort Vatican. If anyone violates the military law, I will not be merciless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, sir. Here are the people who died in Jena and Lenny, and everyone will not lose their honor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; A female staff member took over the topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are still things that may be about your personal affairs. Two ladies have been asking to meet you... they claim to have helped in the previous battle You promised to give them the reward they deserve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door grabbed the hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aggressive women are really troublesome, but they can’t show the shake in front of their subordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, that's not a private matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subconsciously self-defense, after the door I figured out how to escape this robbery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They represent the earliest friendly cooperation forces in the city, and we should try to establish them as role models for cooperation. You are responsible for recording them. The request, the second of Ouled, as long as it is within the scope of our independent military power, will try to satisfy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, are there other important things? If you don't have one, please continue to handle the affairs of the headquarters as before. The battles will be handed over to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, do you not continue to sit down? This is the first battle worthy of the independent military police -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need. In the West I have already done enough staff for the military, and let me enjoy the leisure of the commanders?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was arbitrarily respected for a military ceremony, all officers and The soldiers all laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our independent gendarmes should be able to direct themselves under any circumstances? Then, the princes work hard! I don't want to be forced to come back to clean up the mess." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You rest assured, sir!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the staff of the staff, The door found an excuse to leave their guards here, leaving the dock area alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was on the boat last night, he had already agreed with Reza Hermonte. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has arrived in the phase port for a long time, but has not yet fulfilled the agreement to do that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was entrusted with the most important thing in the world, didn't he? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is holding the pendant on his chest and holding the sapphire with a slight temperature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strongest magician of the world, the founder of the magic net, the stone of memory of Anne Sefer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are going to succeed, Anne. Soon we can meet again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "... um."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the knowledge base simulated by memory did not deliberately deny his words, but whispered in a low voice as an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phase of the pure gold port is naturally located within the safe area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the rebel private soldiers have never been able to approach the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the pure gold, stands the existence of a landmark that can almost be used as this super-large integrated trade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, is the armed guru 'Ganda"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body is made of pure gold The magical figure of the main body stands in the middle of the street, enough to deter all possible enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And its owner is half behind it, playing with the magic loop of its legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Hermont, I am coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be late. How are those? It takes a long time for a good enemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same as the impression, it is difficult to deal with, the boss of the Chamber of Commerce who does not know what to treat people, "the pure gold alchemist "Lesa Hermonte wiped off the oil on her hand and took out her pocket watch and snorted. The pocket watch was big and heavy, and it didn't surprise to shine with dazzling golden light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't solve the problem before noon." The door was covered with a cloak and hid his own epaulette. "Let's go. How far is riding?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not too far. On the beaches near the city, there are buildings that are used by famous families to mark their status..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Nanimen already knows what Reza is saying: "The lighthouse that belongs to 'pure gold' is the destination we are going to?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leisha made a snap, and ran out of a yellow horse from the "pure gold" horse stable, and the bristles did not accidentally flash golden light. The horse was a shoulder higher than the trophy of Naimen. The tall, tall Reza sat on it and looked taller than the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two rides pass through the silent port of the burning. In the case of street fighting, the damage caused was unexpectedly small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Escaped mercenaries who refused to wash and plunder, dropped their weapons, took off their costumes with family emblems, and turned into ordinary citizens to hide in the city. In the shop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his spare time, Naimeng noticed the difference between the city and mainland cities like Lenny and Kengler. The shops next to the streets of the phase port are even more than Lenny, the capital. The door can imagine the street is very lively without war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most shops are full of bilingual signs, and the Coman and Eastern squares overlap on the same signboard, full of Intercontinental exoticism. He often sees the golden figurine of "pure gold" and the "blue diamond" coat of arms that belongs to the name of Reza. There are related shops on almost every street, from money changers and department stores. Go to the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power you are here is really big!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lesa is eager to pull Ma Wei, adjust the speed to the same as the horse of the door, so that the two can talk to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s natural to transfer all the industries on the mainland to Interry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "So a famous consortium puts such important things in a place that everyone knows, is there no problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the door In doubt, the alchemist snorted disdainfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone knows, what about it? Everyone knows that there are more than a dozen banks, dozens of merchants, and hundreds of goods warehouses in the city. Who can steal a large shipment from it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door frowned and calmly pointed out the loophole: "Ah, if it is Organized criminals, or the army can break through. If the local magic association or a sect knows that there are countless unique magical achievements, I am afraid they will organize a large army to attack."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excessive worry." Reza speeded up the horse. "To tell the truth, the defensive magic in the lighthouse, even I can't get into it... I don't think the local wizards association Willing to risk the loss of manpower to attack a lighthouse symbolizing status."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the thief?" Nanimen knows the value of Anne and Bonnie’s secret base. . Those who transcend the knowledge and technology of the times, in the eyes of those who know the goods, may be worthy of five freelancers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no thief. In fact, the lighthouse does not have any guards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Naimen immediately pointed out: "Magic locks and illusions are unreliable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not just magic locks, but full-automatic defense, built in the Golem, Automatic summoning and automatic defense on the basis of machinery. Not so much our lighthouse is a solid underground city, it is better to say that it is a Ganda-style magic creation." Leisha deliberately paused and enjoyed the opposite surprise, "Look I will know. Anyone who sets up a defense system, no one can get in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Automatic system? That is really amazing. I am afraid even Lan Empire University has not built a building with such an advanced concept."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don’t know why, the door is faintly worried. This intuition is much like the sense of crisis that he often feels on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then how do we get in? Bonnie...or say that the Muse Superintendent makes you not here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Bonnie's guy means that you should have a 'key' that can pass through the entire defense system. Didn't you say that there is a belt before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The door was stunned, but then it reacted. Reza did ask him when she was on the boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's good. From here, it's better to go to the beach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two bypassed the heavily guarded phase bridge bridge from the bridge, where You can still hear the intensive shots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of private soldiers tried to break through the defense of the independent gendarmes and fled to Donggang, but there was a rock-solid defense waiting for them. The left-behind fleet under the command of Leonard Kakawi traveled near the strait and captured one and another armed merchant ship trying to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not many bodies floated on the sea and were photographed on the beach by the waves. Some numb people are sitting on the beach, or walking mechanically and stiffly, looking for loot from those bodies. No one tried to block the two men riding through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quarter of an hour, after crossing three other lighthouses, the huge "lighthouse" shining with golden light finally appeared in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's better to say that it's a manor than a lighthouse? Or should it be more appropriate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Resist the door and look up at the huge building in front of you. The pure gold lighthouse is built on the rock platform not far from the beach, consisting of the tallest lighthouse, eight towers surrounding the lighthouse, and the main building of about seven or eight stories that connects these towers. There is a circle of walls to guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great...and even Lenny’s Free Army headquarters is not that big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The door was taken a deep breath and converted to a magical field of vision. The lighthouse itself is the highest crystallization of magical technology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tower and the tower are connected by a cloister, leaving a large number of patios. Imagine that the interior lighting must be quite adequate. At the top of the lower main building, you can see the emission holes left by the gun. In the magical view, many parts of the building exude a secret light, but it is difficult to identify their practical use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza dismounted in front of the main entrance and pressed the palm of his hand against an obsidian stone pillar beside the door, and the door slid quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our people can enter the lower layers. When I need to complete the alchemy experiment, I will come with the assistants in the company and put the automatic The thief caught by the defense system let go, and then spent a weekend here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alchemist took the horse to the stable, and the door was behind her. Bitter smile: "Although the building looks very powerful, but the use is simply a villa."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two or three stone and iron statues in the yard Patroled and guarded the dust and garbage in the yard. The horses are a bit too clean. There are flowing sinks and food tanks filled with forage in front of the horse bar. There is also a magic statue for cleaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are so many ghosts used, even the grooms have been replaced?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Well, these are the results of my alchemy experiment.” Reza’s tone was excited. “This maf magic is going to be put into the market on a large scale.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The price is not worth it? How much is an experienced Ma Rong supervisor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not worthwhile, but as a mansion, you can make guests Surprised, there is ample market." Reza said as she walked out of the stables. "There is no pungent smell of horse manure. It is already a good selling point. There will be many rich people." Want to build such a stable in a mansion? Also, in the cleaning and guarding demon in the yard, there are also products I just finished..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I really don't want to be the boss of 'Pure Gold'." Ningmen smiled bitterly. "But now is not the time to visit the product, we are still rushing to Well done, Ms. Hermont."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cut. It’s really boring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp There was no one complaining to Reza, and she came to the main entrance with her door. The door was noticed, the stained glass window on the right side of the main entrance was smashed, and the protective magic on it was forcibly removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a thief who wants to patronize? I also said that the number of visitors in the past few months has decreased..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened immediately, revealing the hall where the lights were bright and the windows were clear. The ceiling of the hall is three stories high, and the floor tiles under the feet emit a golden and silver metallic luster, which constitutes a complex magical pattern. The surrounding crystals shine, and countless magic lights are reflected in front of the two. Around the hall there are three levels of side porches and dozens of gates, each leading to an unknown building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that this is indeed the key, Ms. Hermont. Please lead the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Although his tone is not impatient, he can't refuse it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resa sighed and followed him into the door: "I know you know, you don't have to be so anxious. From the sixth floor of the tower, the whole building They are all under the strict protection of magic, even if there are thieves, there is nothing to worry about -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"砰嗵". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the sound of heavy metal and metal colliding with each other. The two turned back and saw that the door behind it had turned into an iron wall that had just fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is this--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza’s words have not been finished, more The sound of "砰嗵" sounded rhythmically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"砰嗵". "砰嗵". "砰嗵". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The metal color of the tile in front of the eye rises one level at a time, accompanied by the impact of "砰嗵". Just like there is an invisible giant, the floor is forcibly pushed into an aerial staircase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out...the huge machine in the basement is for this purpose..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The alchemist subconsciously whispered to himself, his fingers swaying invisible patterns in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, just heard a "beep", all the doors in the hall open at the same time, something comes out from inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps of steel on the gilded floor, although not neat, it is not messy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are hundreds of defensive mysteries, all of which are activated at the same time, as if they were welcoming the general’s guards, standing around the hall. Block all roads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all the illuminated crystal lights in the hall are extinguished, leaving only a row of chandeliers above this step. The red light of the chandelier was struck on the stairs through the lens, and the giant main chandelier at the end of the hall was leading to the center of the hall. The chandelier glowed azure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness, you can only see the bright eyes of the surrounding magic figures. There are also some light spots in the air that are bright, and the door does not know what those are, but knowing that it must also be a certain defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nelmen and Reshua couldn’t help but look at each other and saw the surprise in each other’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I don't know what's going on. Since I built this building, I have never seen such a battle..." Alchemy The warlock apologized, "But there should be nothing malicious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door nodded and agreed: "It seems that this arrangement should force people to walk into the chandelier. I also feel that the rituals designed by the two people should be malicious without the aesthetics."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean, these arrangements Is it to ensure that the person with the 'key' must act according to their arrangement?" Resa thought and asked, "That should be more than just a key. Can you tell me what it is?"耐 /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door hesitated and replied: "It is the stone of memory of Miss Anne Sefer. She died in Lenny."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder. Even if the enemy comes with the stone, send the stone to it." Let's put it. No wonder the two bedrooms in the architectural blueprint are placed next to the defense center of the tower top ring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we better hurry. No. Knowing what is considered a condition of an enemy, I don't want to trigger it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza tried to put her hand on it, but the stone column did not respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you have to use your key again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is always clenched The sapphire's hand gently rubbed the top of the stone column. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elevator...ah, no, the mechanical ladder starts!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne's voice is in him Ringing in my mind. Hearing is like her voice in the memory, but the door can hear the difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the real recording of the recordings that Anne designed when she greeted the system. He can even imagine the smile of Anne's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding decorative lights are closed in the middle, turning the chandelier into a flying golden cage. The chandelier turned into a golden cage flying in the tower, drawing a strange curve in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is still not dispelling the magical vision. This building is like a house of surprises for a magician, and every corner is in danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that even the flight cannot pass through the traps in this building. And the structure used is not the same. Complex design."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your words have become more." Retha glanced at the door. "Do you feel nervous when flying in the air?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...not for this reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I am amazed at the magical wonders here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I was impressed with the magic figures and magic traps of the day’s numbers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I admire this idea of ​​"even if the enemy has to control it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the depths of the door, the bad feelings are lingering. Everything you see through the magical field seems to be shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It shouldn't be. It's such a perfect magic system."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden cage Rise straight up in the tower, hit the hook, and slide along the rail into a room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door slammed open. The Stone of Memory in the hand gave a light--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting for the cage to stop completely, Nami Soleton rushed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, his pre-test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the room is a transparent coffin made of crystal glass. It is empty except for some liquids. Don't talk about the spare body, even the protective magic. The only thing that was triggered was that he automatically searched for magic when he appeared with Anne's memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the body? Is this our end?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resher Hull When Monte was stepped forward, the forefinger reached into the liquid of the crystal sputum and dipped it with his tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Static fluid. I think this should be the target, but... the static field is lifted..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has no blood on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crystal is empty. No matter how you look, it is empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The static liquid inside has evaporated a lot, unlike the opening in the past two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is soft and knees, next to the empty crystal curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He holds the last glimmer of hope, soaking the sapphire in his hand into the still liquid - even though the magic field of vision has long told him that there is no magical magic here. sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now how to do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to resurrect Anne, he deliberately accepted the appointment at Interre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to resurrect Anne, he arrived here from the Lonnie and Fort Vatican. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he finally reached his destination, he found that Anne’s body was not here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, it seems that it was not here long ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, Brenney’s time she died earlier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nerves of the brain are conveying the signal of "cry," but his body and soul are not listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things of tears are enough at the time of Lenny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand next to the sapphire is soaked in the still liquid and feels that his blood flow is still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice repeated repeatedly in the ear, Anne died, Anne died, and Anne died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side, Anne’s voice in the magic net is repeated, no query results. There are no query results and no query results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps an illusion, or an auditory hallucination, but the door feels in the mechanical, indifferent voice, with a cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bit his tongue. A little painful, but far less painful than imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I swear. I swear by Lenny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Reza Hermont, can you do me a favor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistance The door squeezed out the sentence from the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the "golden alchemist" is busy searching for rooms. She still didn't give up, trying to find a hidden door that didn't exist near this room. Intuition and reasoning tell Nara, her efforts are futile, and even dying struggles are not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Liesha. Come over now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cool command tone makes the female alchemist 楞A bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the "Intercontinental Army", the tone of Major Neremon Soledon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please fan me now. I want to be heavy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lesa is getting bigger The eyes are like watching a madman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not kidding. This is an order, fanning me a slap in the face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female Alchemy The warlock raised his hand, hesitated, trembled on the right face of the door, giving a crisp sound, leaving five clear fingerprints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the door finally left the water, but not much left. His wrist is still on the edge of the crystal cymbal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a foolish alchemist with no taste and talent, only pride and no mind! In addition to the vulgar gold, what else would you use? I can't get a slap in the face! No wonder you carry the name of Hermonte, but you can only mix it in the New World!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say, bastard!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of Reza’s blood all poured into the face, and the right hand slammed the back of the hand and concentrated on the left face of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alchemist himself made a magical image with gold, the world’s heaviest metal, and she slaps the power of the slap in no way. Anne Sefir of the body, or Olia Hugh Coleman, who has the royal blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this slam, Nikemen flew out and slammed into the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, hug, sorry... is it okay?" Resa reacted fiercely, her face red as blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for waking me up, Ms. Helmont. I have no time to immerse myself in sorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was wiped off the blood of the corner of the mouth, and the blood was stopped with a simple healing magic. His eyes seem to have no feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that you can do a simple troubleshooting of the magic trap trigger nearby. Don't try to find a hidden door, this is not her style. I think Knowing how many traps have been triggered from the top to the bottom of the lighthouse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza quickly found the tower in the room The control loop draws conclusions from the magic feedback of the loop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Several of them were triggered, but they are concentrated from this layer to the middle of the lighthouse. The 15th to 6th floors seem to be intact. There are a lot of losses, and there are a lot of losses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, it’s not that Anne left, that is, someone who is very good at dealing with magic traps commits crimes. A lot of it." Naimen used the magic net to confirm the result with the same magic as Reza. "Next, I remember that you mentioned that there is a device for capturing thieves here, right?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza nodded. At this moment, the door is calm and rational, and he was judged by a few minutes ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take me to prison for them. I want to know how many people are currently caught."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The door was tightly held by Anne's sapphire, and went out, and Reza was busy behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blu-ray shot from the door of the door, all the ghosts and traps in the entire building are in front of the blue light. When she finished the "prison in the ground", she was ready to go through the magic of the feathers and jumped down from the patio. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there is currently no one here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. This range has shrunk again. Let's go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go back Don't you continue searching here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First, all the remaining thieves will be the key clerk. I believe they should have some thoughts about the crime here, just before their president and us For the enemy, it has already been killed. Whether Anne’s body disappears as a body or disappears as a lost memory, I believe they should have some news.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza looked at the doorstep and walked quickly from one after another, using the smallest movements to let all the guards retreat in front of the magic of their creators. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Second, I will begin to investigate the doubts of the churches and magic associations in the Port of Hong Kong. I don't believe their rapid rise to pure gold. I don't know anything, I don't believe that Anne's body can be stolen by several thieves. If Anne left, maybe the church and the welfare homes will have some news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of Magic Net and Anne's Memory, Fastman quickly found a way to get the hall back to its original state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Third, if Anne disappeared as a person, or even forced or voluntarily left the phase port, I will track it from here - < ="" ="">- All routes. I know that there are large-scale slave trade and mercenary businesses in the countries of Italy, Murrayman, and the country of Sinketi. A girl like Anne who loses her memory is likely to Being deceived or even trafficked, it is also possible to kill a road by yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped in front of the stable and finally looked back at the lighthouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe that people who can build such a building, even if they only have an unconscious body, even if they lose their memory, they will not easily come from this world. I disappeared. I will find her. No matter what she becomes, I will find her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
