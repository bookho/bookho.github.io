From the camp of the defending army to the parliament building, it is not too far, but the coup army on this road did pay a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a defensive position...damn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radez; Marshal Govar Cursed softly, passing by the body of a young military policeman; Dico, who was next to him; Major General Lemda frowned at the body and followed behind the Supreme Chief. The commanders came and went and told them about the situation of the various units of the coup. Just like all wars, intelligence is always mixed with good news and bad news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, the communications officer who went to the ring did not respond!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, positive The military police team that blocked the road has been defeated!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The 10th Division has been ordered and is coming directly here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Lost contact with the North Wall garrison!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, captured the police director Rudel!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last good news made Margaret Govar’s eyes shine a little brighter. He walked quickly to the police chief who had a gunshot wound in his abdomen. A slightly blessed police officer lay on a stretcher and was carried by two equally captured police officers. Seeing the marshal coming, the police chief raised his right hand and wanted to say hello; but the greeting of "嗨" just turned into the eyes of the blind, and it became a fierce cough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a pastor?" The marshal looked at the former colleagues and classmates with pity and looked back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor is coming soon. The priest, who was also wearing a blue military uniform, pressed his hand on Rudel's shoulder, clenched his own emblem, and recited a few prayers of the mouth, letting the white light cover the wounded. The police chief coughed a few times and it looked a lot better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radz; Govar leaned down and looked at the loser condescendingly: "Excuse me, this is not your style, Rudel. I I always thought that you should be a person who knows the time. Do you really think that with such a few military police and such simple work, you can block my regular army?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I never thought about it. Even on paper, military, or even diplomatic games, I have never won you - I didn't even dream of winning you this time." The police chief's answer was weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, diplomatic game. At that time we were always playing with a bedroom person. You always hide behind the allies and mobilize some secondary troops. The attack of the ally has never been a troublesome role like the lord. This time, why do you want to play a hero who is willing to take the opportunity?" Gowar’s tone was a bit ironic. The winds of the military generally believe that Jemmett; Rudel is a mediocre who can only become the position of police chief by the good fortune that will never stand the wrong team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I never said that I want to give up my mind... Well, after coming out of the parliament, there is actually a little bit of this idea. In fact, I only However, it is only the right side to choose the team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer immediately made the pride of Govar's face freeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rudel pretended not to see his expression, continued: "Maybe because of Clade; Lopez? Remind you out of classmates, be careful This younger generation is very strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will pay attention. However, it is not so simple to defeat me. The main force of the self-righteous guy has been attracted to I went to the ring. As long as I got to the night, I will be able to win.” The marshal restored his arrogance and pointed to the two police lanes carrying the stretcher. “As for you, Rudel, for the sake of the old classmates, I I will give you a treatment that the prisoner should have. Take him to the ring... No, bring it to the nearby church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." The marshal turned and strode west along the central avenue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenny's Parliament Building, the central authority of the Federal Republic, the point of issue of all federal laws. After the bloody battle, the gray-haired Radz; Margaret Govar finally stood in front of the ladder leading to it. The 72 steps leading to freedom have been completely stained with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunset gradually began to fall, the clouds gradually thickened, and the sky became gloomy. The bell on the top of the head quietly rang six times, and the bell of the parliament’s meeting also sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what, no one will stop him from completing the ceremony anymore. Thinking so, the marshal embarked on the ladder he had traveled countless times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This building was once the whole of his life. Here, he has struggled with the representatives of taxpayers for the benefit of the Free Army. He is also here, he has received countless medals representing honors; also here, he was appointed the highest commander of the Free Army. official. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, according to the plan, this should be a bloodless peaceful coup. He should have been proud to embark on this ladder...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no plan, it can still be effective after the start of the battle." Somehow, Conti; Fox The marshal's teachings re-emerged in the ears of the marshal, accompanied by the sound of guns in the distance. About, another wall was broken by Clade. At that moment, the Marshal of the Freedom, once known as the "Move of Miracles," felt a little confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you do, is it really correct? Can you sacrifice the program for efficiency? Can you sacrifice freedom for security? Can you sacrifice justice for your faith? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello." Di Khao; Lemda saw the sorrow's melancholy and persuaded him: "For the survival of the motherland, this is a necessary sacrifice. If not Reorganizing the corrupt and inefficient government and parliament, we can't rival Gustav. The 10th Division will soon arrive, Clade; Lopez can only surrender. Let him guard the useless ring. We will surely recover there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, it’s all my useless persistence." Gowal shook his head and firmly pointed to the great Go inside the building. The Major General commanded the troops and stepped in faster than him to prevent possible counterattacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone should not move, stay in your own position! Rebels or do not listen to the commander, kill innocent!" Sergeant's bright and strong sergeant They shouted and rushed into the big parliament of the parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chaotic scenes in the anticipation did not appear, and no one questioned their sudden entry. In the usual commotion of the parliament hall, there was no sound. Only a few dozen scattered members sat quietly in the surrounding seats. Marshal Govar took a deep breath and walked to the rostrum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, a shot. Some members pulled out the pistol and fired at him; Di Khao; Lemda blocked the side. The lead was hit on the chest of the Major General, and the energy was neutralized by the faint green aura and fell underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goval did not pay attention to the bullet and started his own speech. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Self-introduction, I am the chairman of the Free Army Staff Conference, Marshal Govar, I think you all know me. I am here today, only one purpose. It is to announce the dissolution of the government and the parliament. Before the next general election, our military government will temporarily rule the country. The government building and the police headquarters have been controlled by us, and all the garrisons in this city are our allies. We are all The elite of the military is very disappointed with the current government policy. So from now on, the parliament is dissolved, but you are both here to stay here, thank you for your cooperation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing his short speech, he looked around. Still a quiet, only one person stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the National Justice Party is holding his head high, in a calm tone, righteous words retorted: "You violated the Constitution and the people, Govar. You do this." I won't defend anything. Even if you disband the government and the parliament, we will rebuild it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More members of the parliament stand up and use anger Eyes responded. Govar looked at them and seemed to want to say something, but still did not say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Marshal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Counting the time, the 10th Division should be coming soon? Marshal Gowar thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The one who was pinched is actually you, Clade; Lopez." The marshal talked to himself and walked out of the parliament building. Accompanied by the roar of artillery from the north. The 10th Division began to attack the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing on the fifth façade of Lenny, Clade; Lieutenant General Lopez looked at the lights in the distance with the flying sword at his waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dense torches formed a fire, with a bundle, two bundles, and three slaves. Three complete full group, 10,000 young soldiers. From this point of view, it can be seen that the first from the torches into six columns, has begun to enter the city. Obviously, they still don’t know anything about the changes in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, it seems that the trap didn't work. Sure enough, there is no plan, it can still take effect after the start of the battle." Klad also muttered to himself. The content is exactly the same as Margaret Govar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy is getting closer. Clade, who had no adjutant around him, waved his hand and called a commander to command the command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just before the 10th Division’s troops approached the wall, the guns were loud. All the chest-wall guns fired together and bombed the land in front of and on both sides of the team. It also injured many soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Hey! We are all friendly! The friendly of the 10th Division! Don't mess up!" The shouts of the coup army soldiers came from below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's put down the weapon right away. Otherwise, this time it won't be attacking the open space!" Five of the big sergeants selected by Clade shouted, voiced Deafening, "The defending forces have abandoned the dark cast and abandoned the coup! If you want to be judged by the military law, let go of the arms and surrender now! Don't be tempted by the ambitions!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; This shouting and the mighty wall-stopping guns made the soldiers more shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't care for them, charge forward!" Seeing the situation is not good, the head of the leading troops waved and ordered the troops to rush toward the North Gate. I don't know why, the suspension bridge was not taken up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sir, do you want to fire a wall gun?" asked a lieutenant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Lieutenant waved his hand in the chest. "They will surrender immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The soldiers screamed for the charge, but the expected shelling did not appear. The head of the commander on the back of the horse was slightly surprised, but the strength was enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This guy with unknown origins really has no practical experience." The head who did not experience the actual combat thought so, shouting: "Oh, Klaid; Luo Pace, you can get the Medal of Freedom, and you will continue to rise..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter words are in his throat. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gates slammed open, with six guns with steel as the outer shell and steam as the traction. The Freedom Army’s secret weapon, the “Craded Gun”, or the “tank” in the mouths of later historians, first appeared in front of people’s eyes – although it was the former friendly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Open fire." Clade's hand slowly slid; within a minute, all the artillery leads were ignited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain-like lead particles are scattered on the wooden moat suspension bridge. Numerous blood flows from the wooden bridge and fell silently into the moat; soldiers who were cannon fodders lost their lives without any meaning. A row of accurate shells fired at the position of the head of the regiment, and the soil there was bombarded in the air. The first group of the 10th Division who lost the command was in a big chaos. The soldiers who had not experienced the real war screamed and fled the range of the artillery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The reason why Govar’s schoolmaster launched a coup, I can understand it now. The recruited mercenaries, and the elected judges... use this The army, fighting Gustav's Guards, is really desperate." Although she achieved a temporary victory, Clade; Lopez's face did not have the slightest joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lieutenant shook his head helplessly and ordered: "Leave one... No, two guards here, don't let a soldier escape, and don't let a soldier come in. If there is any change in the 10th division, then Do not hesitate to destroy them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, where are you going?" asked the lieutenant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Going to join Hull. It’s time to let this farce come to an end." Looking at the last glimmer of light that disappeared in the distance, Clade replied faintly . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goval steps out of the parliament building. After the "Independence and United Gate", he once again stood at the top of the "72 steps leading to freedom." It is designed to look around all the streets and alleys around, and the height of the surrounding buildings is strictly controlled by federal law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Familiar low-pitched sounds came from the north, as if they were playing the enemy’s funeral songs...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt a little wrong, put his hand to his ear, and listened to the source of the gun. The North...not just the North, but the South and the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The enemy and the enemy have encircled the encirclement! They have actually brought in a lot of bullets, and we have a lot of casualties!" A bloody major ran over. To Dico; Lemda reported the status of the battle. Listening to his report, Major General’s face is getting darker and gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Gowar took two steps forward and looked down on the battlefield. What appeared in front of the marshal was the defending army that was defeating, and the steel monster that kept pushing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the top of the steps of the parliament building, you can see that his troops are being attacked from the west and the south, and one after another defending company’s position is forcibly bombarded by artillery. open. The young soldiers of the Third Independent Artillery Regiment did not hesitate to step on the bodies of their peers wearing the same military uniforms, filled with enthusiasm for defending freedom and making meritorious deeds. Not long ago, the soldiers of the defending army, with the same enthusiasm, stepped on the bodies of the same young military and policemen. Soon after, no matter who the winner is, the deceased will be turned into a number in the history book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, perhaps we have counted. The other party has estimated that we will go this way... Simon and South Gate, should have fallen into Lopez According to the current situation, before the reinforcements of the 10th Division come in, we will be completely annihilated..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gowar interrupted the advice of Major General: "It's not necessary to say. Gather all the troops that can still receive orders, break out to the east. Give up the parliament building, don't guard here, we have to break through."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp If you can break through. This sentence is stalked in Di Khao; in the eyes of Limda’s nephew, he can’t say it. He can only nod his head and then answer: "Understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, what time?" Gowal asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...the difference is 10:7." He took a look at the disappearance of the clouds in the thick clouds, and Major General Lemda took out the pocket watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it so late?" Gowal shook his head and walked down the steps. When there were only three levels left on the ground, the Marshal of the Freedom Army stumbled and almost fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, Lymda seemed to see: the gray hair of Marshal Govar, completely turned into a white flower. Perhaps the illusion caused by clouds and twilight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy is breaking out to the east!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"13 even occupied the square!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"11th company is about to regain the parliament building!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her; Major Tedwood stands out Under the newly ignited streetlight, Lenny's urban map is in the hand, and the colored pencil in the hand is generally marked with a mark on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nine Clade guns formed five spearheads and spurred the parliament building from different directions. Everything was written in the plan of Lieutenant General Lopez, very smooth and accurate. The enemy appeared on time, the military and police team collapsed on time, and their appearance happened to hit the soft side of the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to use a word to describe the current situation, it can only be "all goes well." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
