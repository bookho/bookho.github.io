			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is anything more painful than riding eight hours on the road, it is 16 consecutive hours of horseback riding. Mark has no sponge saddle and no shock absorbers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the end of the battle in Fort Fort, the less pleasant Lav. Namlock and her exhausted entourage finally let go of the foam Mount. At this time, the roasting flamingo on the Lenny Street was hard to buy, and the market was already closed. They followed Lily's instructions and lived in a hotel opened by a Ruhrlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect that I would set a record for my life at this time and in this place. This is the Shennong Festival..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female priest who is pampered on weekdays is complaining and gasping, crawling down from the mount that is soft in the stables, but only because of the demeanor On the haystack that looks very soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the money, I have to work harder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡笑笑Consolation. In fact, her condition is not good enough to go anywhere, the inside of the thigh is burning hot, now see the stool will feel scalp numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The politician who had just been solved from the horseback was holding the railings of the stables and vomiting, but unfortunately nothing could be vomited. The remaining few people seem to be a lot easier. One has long been accustomed to the rush of travel. Employer Lily is striding out of the stables to make reservations. She can't see the servant. Seeing them, Lei Fu’s bitterness is even heavier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I knew I had to suffer from this, I would rather inform... Forget it, since it’s all here. Uncle Niton?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The middle-aged pastor came over and carefully raised the lady, and went to the store. Yanika took her leg and looked at the back of Missy with some envy. The other two men immediately noticed this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So then I am coming..." "You..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xu Lan and Parker open at the same time Stepping forward, and closing your mouth at the same time. The knight looked at the assassin with a terrified look and quickly stepped back. He went to the first state secretary, Chase Brighton, and helped the big politician who had already exposed the green to leave the stable, leaving only two The individual is inside the stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...shall help?" Parker Tap asked with some embarrassing smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 wanted to agree, but remembered the conversation last night, hesitating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, I don't think so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She refused him in a panic. Enduring the pain in the legs, holding the dirty horse stable railing and limping out the door. She was unusually worried that Parker would catch up and force her to help her - fortunately this did not happen. After a few more steps, Jenny turned back and glanced over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young assassin who is not good at communication and rhetoric still silently looks at the dagger in his waist and does not make any move that would scare her. This scene made the kind girl feel a slight apology, but she still resisted without opening and left silently. She is a bit afraid of the most gloomy young man in this companion - especially the two daggers around his waist. That would remind her of yesterday's battle...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pike has been kneeling in the stables all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the end of his dagger's grip lighted a little red light. This emergency red light signal has not been seen for too long, so that he did not think of what code should be used to open the handle of the dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"ske...rsa?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He repeatedly tapped the grip of the dagger and finally At the end of the second code, the end of the ball bounced, revealing a small metal bar with four azure blue stones. He did not hesitate to pinch the metal rod into a ring, and the one-time magic item burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you all at Lenny?" The call came. It is only a courtesy confirmation, because the communicator will get the relative distance and direction while starting the "communication buoy". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Emergency. 'Honour' was captured, and Fort Buddha was lost. The reconstruction of the temporary Southern Bureau is not enough to rescue the hostages." The voice speaks quickly. "This is the information of the fog eagle, absolutely accurate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are the tasks at hand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cancel. The target person is handed over to the Southern Bureau for protection, you assist the South After the mission, you will return all the people to DeLand as soon as possible. The time has changed. The call is over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Call ended. Parker re-screws the handle of the dagger, and the brow is deep. He knew that this easy-to-fake adventure mission was over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers’ nightingales are simple and sumptuous. After the first meal of Shennong, the men and women went to bed. This time, Renee and Reeve, she set up a simple defensive magic as usual, and put on a new underwear before going to bed. Miss Pastor fell asleep early, snoring gently, but Yanika was unable to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ten thousand pounds, this is too easy. It always feels that something will happen tonight..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is rolling around in bed, thinking about future adventures for a while, worrying about the betrayal of the employer for a while, and thinking about the home not far from here, she can’t sleep at all. A faint moonlight sprinkled on the bedside, she stared at the window, boring to practice the basic spellcasting gestures. In the meantime, she heard a soft whistle coming out of the window, like a goblin whispering. The faint smog shrouded the surroundings, and everything was like a quiet dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl with brown hair slowly stopped her gesture, closed her eyes, and went to sleep with her pillow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window was gently pushed away, and the whispering goblin quietly landed on the ground. No one can see him. He is surrounded by a city of silence of several tens of feet. The mouth is whistling with hypnosis, and the sand of the demon is sprinkled in his hand. He crept around the bed of Renee, ready to walk to the bed of Reeve...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Even if it is a god, it is too careful to come in. "That."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He" silently stopped without a trace. Although it is impossible to know, it does hear the girl's nightmare under the influence of silence. He turned his head and saw that Seneca was still lying in bed, relieved a sigh of relief--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he let go of his breath, the quilt in front of him Suddenly the volley flew up and rushed to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Activation! When...)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He subconsciously bows and hides. The quilt with life is unfolding immediately, sinking downwards, and immediately marks his position! The invisible sneak hurriedly took out the magical blade that he carried with him, raised his hand and stroked it, and the quilt immediately burned and turned into an ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is enough for the genius girl magician to master his position. Jenny flew up and took the trigger gun, which was hidden under the pillow, and pulled the trigger without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dagger that can pull out the flame is nailed to the ceiling with the ballistics. The magazine was rotated four times in a row, aiming at his shoulders, abdomen and legs, and quietly resting on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the effect of silent magic, all this is silent, even the female pastor is not awakened. If a layman is watching at the side, he can only see the girl's figure dancing alone in the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, well, I surrender. I am myself, my own person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intrusion The person lifted the silence and used the casual tone. Renee did not pay attention to him, but the top of the invisible head with the gun in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't get close, I haven't heard your voice. Unlock stealth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute..." The tone of the man is still not very nervous. "Hey, what time do you have to wait? Come out and save people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the last moment before the card's index finger was buckled, the door of the room was quietly opened, and the sound of Xiulan came from the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it’s not fun to say it so early."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sneak unlocked the invisible magic. Chenika was shocked and the gun fell underground. The man with glasses in front of him is actually standing on the wall vertically! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just pointed at the gun, just a small round shield in his hand. What she had just covered with a quilt was only the illusion that he deliberately played. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said that our current Miss Magician is definitely worth relying on, Isaac?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"If I didn't use this magic early, I should call Jeter's uncle to help me now. See how old she is at the age of 20, how can she have this experience?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man in glasses said to go to the ceiling and stand upside down to observe the entire room. He was wearing a dark blue coverall with a pair of silver-rimmed glasses, which looked like a gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 lowered her head and found that she was only wearing underwear, and she was red on the face. She hurriedly retracted her bed and grabbed her throat to cover her body. The quilt had been Burned out. She felt fooled and asked with dissatisfaction: "Test? Night attack? What is going on here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xu Lan probe looked The corridor confirmed that no one had brought the door and lowered the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"r is 'royal'. s is 'security'. a is 'agency'. That is..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Royal Security Department?" Renee spelled it and finally understood it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the land west of the Ridge Mountains, there is only one royal. "The blood of continuous progress", "the system of talented kings", one quarter of the known world's co-owners -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A kind of uncontrollable absurd sensation Into her mind, her eyebrows tangled, and some smiled embarrassedly. She likes freedom and small animals, hates power and politics; but hateful things are always quietly touching her bedroom, messing up her peaceful life. More questions emerged like a flood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you explain everything when I join? Are you agents not even investigating the background of others?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the situation was urgent at the time. On the night of our first meeting, the Southern Bureau of the Ministry of Security was almost completely destroyed. The Secretary was missing and the Deputy Director was wrapped up by the rebels. We fled in a panic. When I went out of town, when I was about to re-contact, all the clues were almost broken, and our people were too conspicuous if they didn't cover them - then we met you." Xiu Lanyi apologized to her. "I don't have time to explain it until now, sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I was temporarily sent to preside over the Southern Bureau. As an imperial subject, there will always be some Unexpected task..." The spectacled man added, "My own job is a magician. I have recently done research on gravity and optics. I am only working for the Ministry of Security."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know the other person In her father's business, Yanika sighed with relief: "If this is the case, your damn agents will also owe me a self-introduction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In fact, we are not all agents. My true identity is the chief of the Knights of the Guards, the visor of Shulan von Duramon (shulan von dil. Parker is the local bureau of the Ministry of Security, and I am not sure about his real name. The real name of the uncle is Jete Ne, one of the twelve cardinals... By the way, the one in front of you is his nephew.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Isac. Newton (issac ne. I am very happy to meet you, madam."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glasses man slammed down from the ceiling and turned She stood on the floor steadily. Jenny looked at the man who was full of narcissism and shrank into the quilt and continued to ask: "So what about our employer, Miss Namlock?" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when she raised this question, she almost guessed the answer.<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The employer can say nothing wrong. You can reverse her last name." Xiu Lan replied.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
