			<div id="content">VII<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olivia Hugh Coman stood at the top of the tower and looked at the burning harbor in the distance, watching the battle light igniting there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight the first princess of the empire is still wearing the clothing of the Orthodox Bishop's Bishop, and the image of the patriarchal counselor, Rif Namlock. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the undead army’s attack began, she was wearing a court-style, light-looking and complicated casual dress; but after the attack began, due to countless people flocking In the street near the bank, she had to change back to the identity of the cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many imperial expatriates guarding the upper floors of the bank building, providing the highest level of protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaders are the cardinal of Ionette Hartman, the true leader of the Orthodox and the Grand Duke. The bishop came from a nearby church site that had not yet been completed, and organized people who had taken refuge to hide between the streets and buildings near the bank. His parish church is theoretically located next to the governor's house, but the ardent Hartman bishop is not willing to give up the Southern sect to compete for believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether or not they are Orthodox, the average citizen of Phase Harbor sees a cardinal-level oracle user who is guarded in front of a tall fortress I can feel the sense of security from the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the magic, this sturdy building at the foot of Olia could never be built with the technology of this age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brand written in the standard Coman and the Chinese characters is hung on the lower level of her feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of the text on this brand is this -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" treasury". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, whether she is herself or a resident of the Port of Hong Kong, this style is strange, a bit like a castle, and a bit like a tall gun. The building is called "Dragon Cave." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest of Yinlong in the phase port is even taller than the Cathedral of the Reformed Society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The small-scale attack." The silver dragon that appeared in human form lazily stretched out on the heap of gold coins, and the residual wind of her arms A few gold pounds were swept up. "The attack on this scale of the Great Wilderness is not going to happen once in two years. It is not necessary to dispatch the royal army. It can be defended by the Principality of the two Principalities of Figota and Soma. What's so good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just interested." The emperor's sister replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She picked up the telescope again, staring at the spotlights moving in the streets and the bright green light on the sea. The magic lighting of one block after another is extinguished, leaving only the flame swaying by the oil lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mara made a big yawn: "Before you insist on following your brother, now I have to study this enzyme suspense battle here. I am with the cardinal, even if there is an immortal opposite, I can't take the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But maybe one day, I will be forced Like them, they don’t have a lot of cards to fight against more powerful enemies?” Olia retorted, “just like his brother attacked the South.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh? Your Royal Highness Princess is obviously paying more attention to men." Yinlong tweeted and further analyzed when Oli was blushing. "Reassure, this kind of thing is seen at a glance, in the phase port and It’s not just one of our players. Whether it’s the fleet, the church, or even the country, I believe they have cards in the phase port, but they haven’t even played...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Silver Dragon said halfway, suddenly stood up and shake off the gold coins stuck on her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The card is coming out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oria hurriedly turned the telescope and turned to silver The direction the dragon refers to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw the undead army marching silently in the dark. The flag of the Dark Legion of the Revival Elves enchanted the mysterious green sacred light, pointing straight to the treasury fortress under her feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no less pleasant than watching the two armies on the distant dock. Olivia was a little surprised and wanted to call Bishop Ionite to ask for defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this unit supposed to sneak into the overseers of the army? Is it a central breakthrough, the tactics of the two wings?! Here is it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light is what she sees, this is not as strong as the main force of the Reformation Cathedral, but it is also The standard configuration of the overseers and the dragons is not weaker than the power deployed in the port area to suppress the Seventh Fleet and its docks. Although they do not have the ability to fight with Yinlong, the ability to turn the bank into a sea of ​​fire is completely there. If the trading street of the phase port is hit like this, I am afraid that the year will not be eased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not for you to see those guys who are already dead. Going further." Silver Dragon said a joke and reached out with impatience. Put the telescope in Olia's hand down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What appears in the monocular is a glimmer of white light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look again, it’s a knight. The priest on the knight's body is white, and it should be a female priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the commander of the enemy? No, it is the sacred enchantment for the body... There may be excess souls. How can the undead be so powerful? The magical use, even the immortal will not bring the power of the super-dead..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is the female pope. Not ours." Mara nodded slightly to the silver light in the distance. "This is not a sight that can be seen from time to time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like seeing the silver dragon’s gesture In the same way, the silver-white sacred light suddenly sharpened. For example, there are countless swordsmen piercing from the light, revealing countless sharps and forming countless sharp edges! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only this hand, all-phase port only has the people who Yinlong said can do it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She put the sacred enchantment out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oria can’t question "Why Bonnie Sefer will be in the phase port, and the security department is not the same," but attracted by the magical techniques used by Bonnie. In addition to being the blood of the "Royal Cocktail", the Imperial Princess does have the level of a mid-level priest, and it is fully visible that the woman opposite the telescope has a strong blessing to the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead army that is advancing seems to be aware of the threats that follow. The pale-faced elves of the Necromancer commanded their servants, and the death knights were covered with gray evil shields. The friends of the undead began to concentrate on the commando in their hands, killing the solitary threat from the rear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they are ready to fight, it is impossible to remain silent. Even if the army of thousands of people is an undead, it is also an army that is difficult to scorn. Once you start preparing for the battle, it is enough to make a shock! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette Hartman immediately received the news that he rushed to the core of his own defense defense line, ready to personally intercept the incoming enemy . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shrinking the line of defense, concentrating on guarding the dragon's hole... eh?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tall red dress The bishop squinted and the subconscious stepped back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the enemy’s front, there is a light that descends from the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette found that the entire defensive enchantment that he had laid down was trembling with the ups and downs of the Holy Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how the sacred songs from the thorns pierced the array of nights and enemy forces, and resonated with the prayers of the people under the protection of the United Bank. People can't help but sing the Protestant hymns, as if they can resist the aggression of the Undead Legion -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......maybe really. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette took a prayer gesture on his chest and took a step back. Through this gesture, he feels that the familiar and grand grace is coming, not the general magic; that is the highest point of all divine magic that he himself could not touch for many years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magical magic does not have all kinds of variants like arcane; but if it is a high-ranking priest, by increasing his own theological qualities and changing the request to God, you can gain more power beyond the standard surgery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette has not yet reached this realm, but he wants to master some of the belief fields of God. Experienced mid-level priests can read God's preferences from the appearance of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fatila, the goddess of fate... is not right. Is it the guardian goddess Elona? What is the use of miracle for Elona?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped back to the third step. Already at this point, the identity of the person who uses the Holy Magic has come to the fore! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette feels that he can imagine the expression of the enemies of the revival army opposite the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is a normal imperial army, knowing that there is a threat to the most powerful pastor in the world is enough to cause a collapse; let alone an undead army! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the array of undead soldiers, there was a panicking shout and a curse, and then the bow and arrow with the corpse poured into the rear like no money. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revival of the Elite Army's gunpowder weapons is very low compared to the Imperial Army or the Free Army. The use of gunpowder-driven weapons is too difficult for the lack of intellectual inferior creatures, such as scorpions and zombies. If it is not good, it will cause a huge loss of gunpowder inventory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white guardian blade at the end of the road shook a little and suddenly changed shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original number of blades that cover the solitary knight has become longer and sharper, extending into a wall that covers the entire road. Inside the wall of light, the edges of the numerous guardian enchantments are staggered, like countless intertwined sword nets, covering the entire road! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sacred enchantment actually...can still be used like this?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Princess Olia, who looked at the battlefield at the top, exclaimed. The enchantment has become a new and exciting technique, and it is a mistake to superimpose the line of defense to cover the entire road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gaze of everyone, the sacred horsewoman—or the wall of the sacred blade—moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless protective enchantments that condense into a blade, and dance flexibly around her, like a living creature, and a fishing net that is impenetrable. Her horse's speed is getting faster, along the wide straight, straight to the most intensive place in the enemy march queue! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of such an oppressive sacred net, the detachment of the Fuxing Army did not even have the ability to resist it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is the army that attacks the cathedral, there are still some undead who can compete with the people, at least to resist the wall of this excess; but this Just the squad that tried to sneak attack and set fire did not have this ability. Originally it was only the protective enchantment of defensive magic. Under the protection of miracle, every undead it met was overtaken to heaven! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two nine-segment magic, or one eight one nine... This idea is... this is the wall of the sword! It is the sword of those arcans Blade Wall! She also mastered arcane and magic, no wonder she can control such a complicated miracle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver Dragon Mara also showed a sense The expression of interest, she finally remembered where she had seen similar magic. The silver dragon's skin flashed with a silvery metallic light, which made her body shimmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver wall is getting faster and faster, and it has rushed through everything that dares to hinder her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the sacred swords are flexible and changeable, they look like snowflakes from a distance, but they give the impression of "rolling"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unstoppable crushing, like everyone shows her arrival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is the Virgin Bonnie Seifer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods are on! It is still our own church!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the slow ordinary people understand who the people are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why does she not use this hand when she is in church? Because the square in the cathedral is not suitable? Or is it... is this specially shown to us?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette Hartman sighed. He did not continue to look at it, turned around, ordered a small number of guards to prepare to meet the enemy, and at the same time raised his hand to maximize the power of the sacred enchantment. All the Orthodox relics he brought from the Imperial Duran were deployed on the third floor of the Dragon Cave, under which the huge twelve-edged sacred emblem formed a giant shield to defend the banks and exchanges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The enemy may turn to head and rush to us, be sure to hold it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, In the face of the seemingly unstoppable horsewoman, several death knights and friends of the undead turned their heads. Instead of trying to resist the attackers in vain, they turned to order the troops that had reached the trading street to charge forward, and they even charged hundreds of cannons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are out of tune before and after the offense, lack of command, these undead creatures just madly fleeing the final rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not so much a charge, it’s a rout – they would rather face the same solid defense in front of the dragon’s cave, and they’re not willing to face that All the undead smashed the wall of the Light of Light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The electorate's gods can do so..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette uses half It is awkward, generally sighing in envy, raising the sacred arbiter in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big Sword Form!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is proud of the orthodox and the Grand Duke Church One of the sacred weapons. He himself is also a cardinal with no more than one hundred people in the entire Orthodox Church. He is also the pride of the gods, and the blessings of the sacred enchantment are reflected on him, making him feel full of strength and will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but such Ionette Hartman couldn’t help but envy and marry the woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resident, undead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal is roaring, the hand is better than him The big sword with a lot of arms smashed the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Sword hits the cursed armor of the Death Knight, and the metal makes a harsh deformation and break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warm-up battle as a prelude is over, playing The meeting has just begun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie Sefer thinks so, in the "Dragon Cave", that is, the United Bank in front of the door, the horse is slowly retracted The sacred sword wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protective enchantment of the treatment and guardian goddess Elona Grace reluctantly retreats, like a eucalyptus growing in the opposite direction, returning from the towering tree The earliest sapling state. When the swords returned to the sacred protective enchantment, Bonnie took off the hood of the priest's uniform, revealing her brown short hair and a headgear made of blessed silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who took refuge in the trading street looked at the fading wall of the sword with reverence, as if they were still there. The wall of the sword formed by the sacred protective enchantment is invisible, but people always feel that it seems to be able to see the remains of the undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overwhelming sword wall adds a bit of pressure to the Archbishop beyond the holiness of the weekdays. People watched Bonnie silently, and some devout people even fell on the gravel road on the trading floor, just like the prayer hall in the cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry. I am late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am still breathing heavily Onette Hartmann red, Bonnie took the initiative to reach out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionet Hartman, who had just had a bloody battle, coughed a few times. He had just broken the sacred shield by a top-ranking headless knight and broke several ribs. But even so, he did not hide his attitude: he wanted to immediately drive away the uncontrolled reinforcements in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he can't guess Bonnie's intentions. What is important in the Dragon Cave, it is important to have the first fighting power of the Southern Church come alone at this time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since I am here, I am sure to look at your defense here. See you next to Silver Dragon. For the Innovation Club, this is the strongest of Westport. The refuge point, if it is broken, the consequences are unimaginable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie Seifer said as he looked at the people around Ionette. Did not find the target she was looking for. Maybe it's makeup, but it shouldn't be hidden in the civilians. She judges this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, your red dress is hurt. Do you need me to treat it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bang Ni saw the injury of Ionite at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing serious -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette is about to say rejection, Bonnie He has already squeezed a healing and raised his hand on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this barbaric practitioner, the Cardinal was a little embarrassed to bow his head and prepare to thank him, just in time with Bonnie’s gaze. The bright blue light flashes in the eyes of the saint, like two crystals that are dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you still have hidden top mages? Answer me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subconscious answers blurted out : "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#;&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The interrogation asked the heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, "This behavior -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" However, it seems that he is also holding you, this is a good thing." The overwhelming therapist who bought and sold the strong, if nothing happened, threw the horse to a female priest behind Ionite. "Now take me to see Your defense and your Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouth said "Take me up," Bonnie did not stop at the foot, and went straight to the bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course no one dares to stop her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of people here are civilians who have taken refuge. I have seen Bonnie’s oppressive debut, most of them have only worship from the bottom of their hearts. And admiration, even the atmosphere does not dare to breathe. As for the guards of United Bank, even if they are imperial, they know that the archbishop is one of the major shareholders of the bank, and how can they stop her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alert in Ionite’s mind has been raised to the highest level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly chased behind Bonnie, brought his spirit, and sent a message: "His Royal Highness, who is the secret mage you are looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An immortal." Bonnie was two steps slower, and he replied when he caught up. "The commander of the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Imperial!" Ionet was shocked and almost forgot to use the communication technique. "It is impossible for me to be here. If there is one, then it is necessary to take the hand of Lord Mara!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom two layers of the bank are the trading floor, which is now crowded with people who have taken refuge. People spontaneously gave way to the saints, and the devout people silently crouched down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two talked with the magic that only the other party could hear, crowded through the crowd and boarded the third floor of the Jinkudong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And even here, how can you find an immortal? They are no different from the general mage!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie did not answer this question, but continued to walk up the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, here is the core of the defense system that Ionite has carefully deployed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie walked toward the Holy Emblem and blinked at the emblem of the twelve-sworded sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orthodox Church’s 12-blade blade emblem, which is poked in the center of the three-storey empty vault, has more than a dozen hanging on the support column below. Unknown sacred instruments or holy relics. Unlike the general Protestant pastors, Bonnie is familiar with the various variants of the Orthodox Church. The core of the Orthodox Holy Emblem is the number of the "Twelve" promised by the Covenant, but the specific style has various variants according to God, the church, and the use, from the twelve-pointed star, the double-decker six-star to the four-fold three-third, etc. All kinds of shapes can be described as endless changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The God of War's Twelve Shots? I thought it would be the badge of the guardian goddess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I am used to defending with the grace of my own good." Ionite squinted and took a few steps. "Those are the holy things that the Pope has handed over to me, please don't touch it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the empire's expatriates basically here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saint suddenly stopped and asked softly Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. At least the escorts and parish priests we came here are here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good. I use this protection law for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette opened his mouth and widened his eyes: "Don't say don't touch -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Bonnie's left hand has been shot on the support that supports the emblem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, the power of these holy things is quite strong, and you are convincing the church to be worth the money in the Intercess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie grips the foot of the bracket with his left hand, and the purple change electro-optic light extends straight up the bracket, hits the body of the sacred emblem, and casts twelve pieces of sacred silver. The embossed swords were slightly rotated each time - just like a precision-turning mechanical clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twelve stars that were originally emitted by radiation were closed together, and the twelve-pointed star emblem was turned into a hexagonal sword star used by the Protestant gods. The pattern of the huge sacred emblem that was not produced by this relief has ever been moved! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not Bonnie Seifer who is both proficient in arcaneism and magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Seeing Bonnie's change of magic that belongs to the Arcane is so skillful, Ionite Hartman can only admire it. The original thought of reprimanding has become a question: "Is this possible?" Is the sacred circle of the immortal? But is this theoretically possible? The immortal and the undead friends are ordinary people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ah, you probably don't know." Bonnie looked at the holy things and took a few pieces from them in different positions. "The immortal and the undead friends are not the same. The friends of the undead are indeed mortals, dead. Most of the spiritual masters are also, but the immortals are different, their souls are not all inside the body, so just raise the magical array -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette The eyes are lit up. What Bonnie Sefere said is that even the Imperial Security Department did not have the knowledge! If this knowledge is brought to the church -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the voice of the saint is suddenly interrupted here and does not continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not Bonnie’s voice was suddenly interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather, all the sounds are gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things in the world are in silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holy emblem, the treasury, and the refugees are all gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a grayish yellow monochrome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the color of the air around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette Hartman rubbed his eyes and took a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, cough... Purification!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Orthodox high-ranking priest, this low-level magical magic Ionite can raise his hand Out, you can blow away almost all the poisonous gas from the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grayish yellow strong acid air disappeared from his side, and he took a deep breath and recovered from the situation that was previously smoggy. Trying to start looking for a raid on his enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, can't find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no holy emblem. No enemies. No comrades. There are no guards of the vault. No Bonnie Seifer. Not even the walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Ionet’s ability, the air in the entire vault should be instantly cleaned up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he still has, and only the yellow acid mist, is quickly polluting the air he has purified! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a vault?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sour mist is endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a cold, strange female voice rang in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the bishop of the Orthodox Church? Constant purification on yourself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not Bonnie · Sefir's voice, not her communication, is a strange communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette was awakened by this sentence, and hurriedly kept the second purification that was being prepared on his body, forming a piece that could only accommodate himself. Clean air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even the purified air smells full of decay and unpleasant taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are I sent away by the transmitted magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette Look around the ground and judge the situation. The ability to transfer his silent magic to other places, the user can only be like Bonnie Seifer, who touched the peak of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is not painful and should not be injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that nothing has been taken away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't anyone using the transfer magic be malicious to me? Is it Bonnie, but why...no. If she sent me, it shouldn't be needed. It’s so troublesome.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it “time stop”? And the wishing technique is called the highest achievement of arcane magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only time for the power to stop, in order to transfer space in front of a cardinal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does there really be an immortal? When he and Bonnie Seifer acted, they touched the bottom line opposite? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go straight ahead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold female voice rang again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette slightly hesitated, and then clasped the "Covenant Arbitrator" at the waist and walked in the direction indicated by the voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sour mist around is so dense, so endless, I am afraid that this is not the ordinary material world that I am used to, but a sub-position that is communicated by summoning magic. surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such a dangerous anomalous plane, it may not be a good idea to defy this mysterious voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After getting used to this dim yellow, the eyes are gradually able to see things beyond a certain distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land is desolate under the feet, and the yellow-green soil has no life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an idea flashed through Ionite's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But even in the Far East, the wasteland of the Far East, there has never been a legend of acid mist that is dying?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge black shadow gradually emerges from the other side of the dense fog, and the outline looks like a city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the female voice did not indicate again, Ionite continued to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed a city, he is approaching the city gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the city gate is a typical Coleman architectural style. He studied architectural history at the Taranto Theological Seminary and was able to recognize that this was the typical first dynasty architectural style, but the high walls lacked the protruding parts for shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a Coman city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river in the moat is not unexpectedly deep Black, no matter how you look, is full of curses and dangers. The black and green walls are covered with moss, and the yellow-green acid slime squats on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no city gate, and the place that should have been the gate is only empty. The suspension bridge is still there, but it is not made of wood. It is carved from a piece of black slate. It is smooth and clean, and it is in sharp contrast with the dirty and harsh environment around it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked in along the path without the guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buildings inside the walls are extremely scarce, and all buildings that are not built with solid rock no longer exist. Often on a whole street, only three or four scattered old houses stand still, and the rest are cracked land and unpopular wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is unlikely to be a great wasteland, and Ionette Hartman is so judged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revival elf empire on the Great Wasteland could not have the city of the first dynasty, and he never heard of any city of this size falling into the undead The hands of the Legion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But where is this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal is gone, go, finally, the road underfoot gradually disappears, and the buildings around it are getting scarcer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the city is a city in the first dynasty of the city of Koman, he feels that he should have entered the castle boundary of the aristocratic family, which should have been beautiful. A garden full of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this seemingly cursed wilderness, the building stands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female voice said the third sentence without feelings . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette looked up and observed the castle that was barely visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, this is hard to describe as a castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a building without color, no windows, or even a structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the first dynasty style, not the dark age style, not the recovery period style, not the contemporary style, and certainly not the elf empire style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s Bonnie Sefer, she would probably describe this stone-like office building with no windows as a “postmodern style” "But for Ionite, the word has not yet been born." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excuse me, what is the place here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette Hartmann Finally I couldn't help but ask for an exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This city has such a ruin as Koman, I believe it must be inextricably linked to the Empire. I must have heard this name. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
