			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xvii<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two white beam signals crossed the sky of the first night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick horseshoes stepped over the shadow cast by the grove, bypassing the flank of the second guard, and the people immediately did not know that they had been The observation post was found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About twenty of the company's cavalry are pointing to the side of our army! The defender is facing the enemy in the direction of the bayonet, the two wings continue to attack! Do not let them detect us Already ready!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ega; Eugen Shensheng will only inform the commanders of each company by the code that the staff members can understand, causing a while Little commotion. The total attack on the frontal enemy in the booking was immediately suspended, and the four companies were transferred to the back to prepare for the defense against the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides have patiently dispatched troops to adapt to the ever-changing situation. In the past exercises, the French and the Stilburg Defence Forces were the two teams with the highest winning percentages. The record was far more brilliant than the Lennie defending army that he is now commanding; but tonight is not an exercise, and it is not filled with paint. Empty bombs. Lieutenant Colonel Eugen chewed the gums irritably, confidently waiting for the enemy's attack in anticipation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge cavalry team reached the assault line 150 meters away from the enemy at the same time, staying in the shadows, seems to be looking at this side situation. In the dim moonlight, the slamming guns rang, and the fire of the muzzle flashed out, which seemed to indicate that the battle of the fortress guards trying to retake the fourth guard was in full swing. Therefore, these competent cavalry did not hesitate for a long time and immediately launched a surprise attack. Each assault queue consists of two consecutive connections, each of which forms a square array of thirty-four-width widths. A total of six frontal assault queues are spread over the front side of nearly eight hundred meters. Instead of hiding their whereabouts, they shouted the slogan of the earthquake, accompanied by the light of prayer, and straight behind the enemy array! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always keep an eye on the guards behind the company’s commanders who have not missed this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guard line raises the spear!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lin’s bayonet and spear are hundreds of meters The length of the line of defense rises at the same time, reflecting a faint cold awn in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shouting sound immediately turned into a scream. I haven't waited for the charge to react in the front row of green cavalry, and the bayon forest in the dark has already poked them off. There are five layers of deep guard lines that are enough to block the Empire's reloaded knights, not to mention the light cavalry of the Muse. After all, there is no invincible iron cavalry in reality, and the well-equipped infantry can actually deal with the cavalry's frontal assault without any tricks. The fact that a small number of cavalry assaults a thick array of infantry can only exist in fictional novels. Seeing that the next Fagas army was also suffering fatal losses...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left end of the left wing suddenly jumped out and crossed the entire incredible speed The front line. The rider in the shiny Mithril chest lowered his figure, and the glare of red light danced on the scepter in his hand, turning into a red arc across the battlefield, crossing the forefront of the entire camp. The shooting line passed by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the line of death that only a madman will pass, but this person has rushed over! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All guerrilla cavalry revolves!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every cavalry immediately grabs Ma Wei, hundreds of sabers inserted back into the waist, replaced by the pistol just pulled out. Appropriate is still rushing to the bayonet array of horses neatly stopped, rows of rows accurately circling to the right, leaving only the bullets that the rider immediately fired at the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their movements are as accurate as real dragon knights, just as small steps are neat and beautiful - there isn’t a horse crossing the cross shot The red line of the line! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who can make this tactical action are like stars in the sky, but there are not many cavalry teams that can make this tactical action - as for the immediate change from impact to " The cavalry of the Dragon Cavalry Dance is no more than three in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While seeing this movement and that ride, Lieutenant Colonel Eugen knew who the opposite was. He spit out the gum in his mouth and meditated on the prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me use my sword."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White light whirls to the single ride across the front of the line, straight to the enemy commander across the battlefield! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Robert; Ayr, this is a gift for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On horseback When the human voice heard the sound, he immediately released his left-footed horse, and his body slanted on the side of the horse, revealing a wonderful riding. Then, he slammed the scabbard and let his sabre pop out. The hilt touched the white light in the air - the direction of the revolving sword was turned, and it was flying over the horse's head! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, are you a bribe? Eugen? The rules do not allow it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The commander with the position of the middle school on the shoulder replied loudly, and immediately followed the shooting cavalry team to the outside of the rifle range, so that the sniper team that Eugen urgently transferred was emptied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commanders of both sides are full of heroic co-ordination, so that the two armies are full of joy and thunder - but in fact no one is cheap. The undead guerrilla cavalry marched back and forth along Eugen's line of defense, trying to find the other's flaws; Eugen showed his talent as the "Commander of the Free Army Special Forces" and blocked the other party with a small number of reserve teams. Destroy all possibilities of the offensive plan and return all the troops that are left out to the central position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like the first ten hands on the board that know each other’s chess players. You don't have to do any long exams to read the other's intentions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The commander on the other side should be the 'legula of the French army', Lieutenant Colonel Ayr? You can see the shape of the guerrilla cavalry here. It feels like going back to home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the wall of the fortress two kilometers away from the south, the envoys from the empire sighed uninhabited. The female captain officer who was in charge of monitoring him heard a slight smile: "You have a lot of affection for Faith, Lord of the Viscount?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, just for guerrilla cavalry It’s very emotional. I’ve been fighting with their harassment forces since I was a teenager. In the Principality of Figota, both the guerrilla cavalry and their commander’s name can make the crying baby close his mouth.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rasta’s joke is not funny, and Isis didn’t know how to react, but she just laughed and shifted the topic: “What do you think of the current situation? We want to Listen to the opinions of the Lord who is familiar with the French army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few moments of indulgence, Count Rasta looked at the torches moving below: According to the current situation, our army should have a slight advantage. The other side is a firearms cavalry, but the surprise attack has completely failed. In the face of a well-equipped opponent with a bayonet and a musket, the killing power is obviously not feasible, and the remaining choices are only Let the opponents shake the air or find the flaws of the other party. If you are facing the emperor, you still have the opportunity to find flaws; but in the face of the well-known friends, all their actions have been sealed. Plus, Eugen has just swelled me beautifully. The morale of the army, even if it is a guerrilla cavalry, there should be no chance to win a big victory now. After all, it is not the time when the knight can swept the infantry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From him The last sentence can hear some loneliness. After all, he is also the person who is referring to this outdated "Knight" title. However, his thoughts are not as old as his title. The analysis of these sentences is quite thorough, reflecting the basic qualities of being a commander, and several surrounding staff members are somewhat surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would it be too optimistic? The defenders of the Fourth Fort and the infantry whose wings were just repulsed are nearby, if they are all brought together Clipping, there is still a chance to smash our army." Itis directly raised the rebuttal, it seems that she has been pushing the battle. On the side of the door, the face of the door was red and red: he was attracted by the wonderful scenes of the cavalry assault and the main officer's duel, and did not consider the changes in the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From here, our army is indeed surrounded by the situation. But the encirclement is not so easy to attack. The following three The movement of the enemy forces is obviously chaotic, and it is obviously not a genital relationship. This level of coordination cannot in any way incite our military positions. Even if we attack with the consciousness of sacrificing one wing, we can only force our army to break back into the city. After the fourth guard is indeed retaken, the enemy will begin to retreat... Unfortunately, this opportunity is really good. If there are another two thousand troops, I can let the enemy except the guerrillas The army has no return."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount's tone is indifferent, but it contains a firm self-confidence - the confidence that a veteran with rich experience has. He said that if he can do it, he can do it. This confidence has infected everyone around you. If there are really two extra troops, the surrounding staff may reach a consensus, and let him be rescued by the emperor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"The Robert should be the person who controls the Faust army staff? This kind of apparently victorious hopeless war of resistance, why did he fight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heard The problem is that the surrounding staff officers are laughing. Itis sighed and reluctantly explained: "I just can't just graduate from the new Ding. No matter how the failed battle plan, if you withdraw it without any loss, you can only prove that the officer is incompetent, and the final report is also I can't write. Even if I know that I will fail, I have to work hard to the last moment, in order to give my superiors the impression that they have worked hard - this is in the army, no, this is the iron that survives in this world. You work hard again. Well, if others don't know that you are working hard, it makes no sense. Even in the emperor, it is the same, Mr. Rasta?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... You have to please the superiors, we have to please the emperor, one thing. In this world, you can't rise to the top without doing so." Rasta said with a disgusting expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, should Robert be an exceptionally cherished person? I don’t think he should continue to fight indefinitely in order to express himself..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if you cherish the sorrow, you still have to give way to your future. Even if I am facing this situation, I will probably work hard until the last moment. After all, it is a surprise plan that risks you. If you can't take a foothold before the big troops arrive, you have to take responsibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a moment, I still insist on my own point of view: "But it is a commander who always stands at the forefront of the team and would rather expose himself to stop the troops from attacking. Can the average person not do that? He is really just to perfuse the superiors. Do you stick to it? There are certainly other reasons..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It may also be waiting for reinforcements, but this possibility is not high." Rasta Looking at the distant battle, "Look, their flank infantry started again. A failed counterattack. This is obviously only a routine attemptless attempt. The cavalry can't use the infantry... If they still have reinforcements, they have already entered the front line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of their discussion, the Cousin Less Correction marked the latest two military positions on the command map. Eugen’s reinforcements succeeded in assembling and almost conquered the third garrison; the gray-faced Fas squadrons were crowded on the south and east sides of the third frigate, trying to prepare for the next offensive. The position they held was also stated: they had no other reserve teams other than the guerrilla cavalry that had already attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the door; Soledon still feels faint uneasiness. He always felt that there were still factors that were considered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harassment and anti-harassment. Assaults and counterattacks. Block shooting and sniping. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers wearing the same uniforms were killed in the inside and outside of the Fortress, which was only a few hundred meters square, built solely for the artillery base. Finally, after the seventh assault company reinforces the wall, the weak French Marquis began to retreat to the northwest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near ten o'clock in the evening, cheers finally came. Ega; Eugen stopped on the wall that had been deformed and looked at the enemy on the east and south sides. Robert's people were divided into several harassment groups, and they were constantly attacking the guards he stayed there. They did not make a decisive assault, but such cumulative losses were unbearable for several companies that served as guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the guards withdraw and enter the shelter of the artillery range of the Fort. The rest of the troops are here to replenish the ammunition and gunpowder. One hour later The fourth defender launched an attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commanders of the various units reported the loss status. Except for a few of the companies facing the guerrilla cavalry and more than a quarter of the attacking forces, the remaining troops were only slightly damaged from one-twentieth. The fighting in these few hours is not intense. Upon hearing such a result, Eugen finally breathed a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if they have reinforcements, they will probably wait until the afternoon to arrive... It should be possible to end the battle before dawn."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the previous battle, the city's artillery was probably destroyed by half, but the rest also provided enough deterrent. The guerrilla cavalry finally tested it and, as everyone estimated, withdrew the gun's range. However, they did not completely withdraw to the fourth defender on the east side to strengthen the defense, but began to construct the fortification in the middle of the plain south of the Third Fort, the range of the Fortress artillery and the main stuffing artillery. The guerrilla cavalry abandoned the horse and guarded it at the temporary line of the magic engineering team, just as it would prevent the fortress guard from reinforceing Eugen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is too strange... Are they holding the idea of ​​destroying us here? How is this possible? Why are they retreating to the northwest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert can bring up to 5,000 people, and Eugen is so judged; but now it is shaking and faintly biting his confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lieutenant colonel walked north along the top of the seven-turned wall, looking out over the avenues and forests that stretched north. The night and thick fog completely obscured his sight. Even the fourth guard was only looming in the telescope. The paradox was more distant to the avenue of the capital of France. It seems that you can see the fire swaying in the light, but it seems to be just the illusion of the eyes, or the alien creatures that act in the dark. The earth after ten o'clock in the middle of the night, there is no light, no real, only the fog of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, or not? Will there be enemy reinforcements coming in? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers are all resting, but Lieutenant Colonel Eugen is difficult to decide. Robert is also a member of the Special Warfare Department, and now a quarter of the Freedom Force's magic users are in his Pharisees. Although it is theoretically impossible for him to empty the entire northeast front line, but...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Send two reconnaissances with a mage to connect to the forests of the north, others People pay close attention to time supply. Regardless of their actions in the South."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is determined to take cautious action. If there are enemies, they can only come from the north. At that time, it is only necessary to defeat the enemy's reinforcements, and the remaining lonely troops will not be defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the officers are already jubilant on the head of Fort Fupe, where they cannot see the boreal forest. The results of the siege war proved that the number of opposing forces was as small as estimated. In the opinion of the staff, the other party’s adventure has failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Collected! Faster than expected!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe we should consider The defense of the South Bank Fortress. If there is a plan for cooperation between them, the troops there should be almost moved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no need for this. After all, it is God Festival, until now, it is very difficult to mobilize the soldiers. I guess, maybe the guys of Lopez are not there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry to retreat Well, I have dug what trenches. It’s useless for those who have been recalcitrant for more than a thousand people. How can they not escape after the artillery is mobilized tomorrow morning?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The staff members praised the accuracy of Lieutenant Colonel Eugen, and the crowd was filled with optimism. Even the second staff officer Peter; Cousin began to develop further pursuit plans. But the envoy from the empire is still frowning, talking to himself, considering the other's actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the 'legula of the French army', Robert. When faced with him, we never dare to celebrate the victory too early. He is notorious The magic engineering team has brought it, how could it be so defeated? What kind of troops are compiled, which shows the tactical intentions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well. If it is an engineering team, it proves that he is determined to be here." This is not the young voice that is not confident of the door, nor the frivolous female voice of Itis, but a deep bass. Rasta turned his head and saw a strange gray-haired elder with a huge golden four-pointed star on his shoulder. He never thought that he would meet this person at this time, and he was busy with his spirits and took a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following the will of His Majesty Gustav, liberation of the Knight Frasor; Rasta Rasta sees the Grand Marshal."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rasta respectfully and cautiously looked at the famous "Italian intelligence system" known as the "Stilburg miracle" code. For a long time, the imaginary enemy is now the target of persuasion, and the world is so volatile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the national book that my emperor entrusted me to transfer..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal did not pick up After passing his national book, he turned his back and pointed his finger to the dark battlefield below. He asked: "According to your opinion, what should be the next strategy, Viscount?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is testing me? Rasta thought, his mouth proudly raised, and he took the national book back to the waist and strode forward to Govar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gowar nodded and continued: "Where do you see, where will the enemy come from?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ambush from the north, lurking in our army The inside should use the road opened by magic, or fly..." Rasta slammed, not revealing the military secrets of the empire, "should be these three."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The marshal smiled incomprehensibly: "Are you the same as Eugen's judgment? But in my opinion, you have missed a very likely road, but the sea..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the sea, they use the merchant ship that they rented.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small self-talking voice coming from afar, almost It was opened at the same time as Marshal Govar. This did not escape the ears of the two, they were surprised to look at the young lieutenant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it your own judgment?" Rasta's doubts blurted out. Does this big boy have a unique talent for tactics? However, as an informant of the Imperial Security Department, such an action is too unscrupulous...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not my judgment. I am just for Itis. The captain observed the enemy's situation and observed an unknown fleet..." Yanmen smiled and shook his telescope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really coming, it’s too fast. How many?” Margaret Gowar asked aloud, attracting the attention of the entire staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reporting Chief, you can see three large armed merchant ships, the water line is very deep!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Only three merchant ships?" Seeing everyone is shocked, Rasta, who is unfamiliar with the water war, whispered to Itis, who is around. "Can this probably sell hundreds of people?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female captain recalled: "If the infantry is transported, it will probably be less than one thousand; if the cavalry is up to three hundred, this number is not enough to affect the battle..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There must be artillery." Gowar strode past them and said in an unquestionable tone, "God down, be sure to stop them from landing! Let these guns land, we will bother "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff immediately became busy, mobilized the man to the coast for defense, and urgently ordered the fleet to be dispatched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the other party seems to have only two merchant ships, no more fleets approaching. The warning turrets instigated several shells and forced the two merchant ships out of the good port area where they could land. Just as they breathed a sigh of relief, the other party made an unexpected move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Finally found out. Abandon the ship!" The chief of the French army, Robert; A. Lieutenant Colonel (robert el) stood in the fourth guard On the battlements, the giant fortress in the south was ordered to make an order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three armed merchant ships turned to the rudder and slammed into the shoal near the Fourth Fort by unfortunately by the southeast wind. The hull collided with the reef, swayed, and caused huge noise, and the residue of the good wood splashed. When the seawater poured into the bottom cabin, the hull immediately slanted to one side. I haven't waited for the ship's side to touch the sand, and the engineering team that has long been waiting for the deformation and construction of magic on the shoal has been shot. The reefs changed shape under the influence of their magic, connected and paved into a path leading to a stranded vessel. The soldiers immediately stepped forward and filled the gaps in the stone with sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just a few minutes, several man-made landing platforms paved the rocky beaches and connected directly to the ship's side that was seeping! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the watchful eye of the fortress guards, the horses that the cavalry gave up were taken to these stone roads, and one by one light and heavy artillery Dragged it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five. Ten doors. Twenty. Thirty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first ship was a 800-pound gun and a 1,500-pound eagle. The second ship is a 2,500-pound cannon and a 10,000-pound heavy-duty gun for siege. The third ship is about enough ammunition for one night, from ordinary solid bullets to precious new acid-filled magic bombs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of everyone on the wall of Fort Fati has finally changed. They finally understood each other's bold plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
