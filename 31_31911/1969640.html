			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xiv<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has just got the latest batch of skewers and tunneling, assault Received an order to enter the battle preparation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All put on military uniforms, bring those little things with you! Next, you may have to face street fighting, so everyone must wear a chain armor to prevent possible The approaching battle. The shield syrup is three times per person, and the bayonet is also good! All the sergeants bring their own scepter. From now on you are the caster, responsible for providing support and deterrence! Packing up things, gathering after fifteen minutes, Each row of platoons arrives in advance of the entire team. If the meeting is not over yet, then rest on the spot. Disband!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the pain to convey the order, and the doorkeeper handed over the logistics department Annie, she rushed to the staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I add, bring the tower shield. If you don't have a tower shield, you can take the time to go to the armaments. You will definitely use it! People with insufficient arm strength come to me. Here is the power potion!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne is behind him with instructions about the new equipment – ​​among the soldiers he knows, she is the most superstitious. Resist the door and not think much about the use of the tower shield in the street fighting, because this call is very urgent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire station is in a mess, and all other companies are still gathering, and from time to time can see the officers and soldiers who are running around looking for troops. When he rushed to the conference room of the staff, more than half of the company's company officers did not arrive. Only Master Benson was nervously talking to the messenger from the city of Kangle. The height map around Kengele on the wall gave way to the city's street map, with a few signs that didn't know what to signal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many people are still missing?" A moment later, Benson looked up from his nervous conversation with the messenger, with dissatisfaction in his tone. Are they so slow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are probably more than a dozen companies still in the collection. Otherwise, we should stop using these connections, let me know directly?" The chief staff officer of the side reported and made his own suggestion. "After all, we are not going to fight this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not use? Such an urgent moment, How can we not use all the forces? You know, there are 3,000 elite emperors in the north of the city ready to interfere with the situation here! Isn’t it necessary to invest as much as possible?!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the words of the former member of the parliament, the chief staff member first glimpsed, and then forced to laugh and remind the master of the teacher: "Hello, you should leave three points in combat operations." One of the living forces is a reserve team. Otherwise, in the event of a change, we will lose control of the situation. The company that can't get up for such a long time... there is no difference if you don't invest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This professional military officer from the military school did not leave him a face. ! Benson yelled, coughed twice, and said: "Let the messenger first introduce the situation of riots in the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The situation is In this way, the results of the election were first released, and then all the radical autonomous members at the door froze. I don’t know who initiated the initiative. They concentrated and shouted 're-election' and wrapped many observers to the Federal Party. The headquarters... It should be almost now.” The messenger who came to report the letter, after drinking a cup of tea, continued to describe the dangerous situation. He was trembling all over the body because of the tension, and the glasses slipped off the bridge from time to time. "The subsequent three-party statement made the situation worse. Brighton did not ask the supporters to calm down, but instead said that the election results would never be acknowledged. Federal Party Chairman Phil and Vice-President Luther asked for cloth. Leiden accepted the public opinion and acknowledged the failure. The wall grass Machiavelli was irresponsible, but said that it would decide to unite the cabinet according to the public opinion... I fled from the election headquarters. Please hurry to maintain order, and wait until the bloodshed is late. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking. What is the reaction of the empire?" The chief staff interrupted him impatiently. "How much time do we have?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The empire has not responded so far. Their observation team was blocked in the city with us. But if they also get news..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger’s words were interrupted again, this time it was Benson himself. "Which company can complete the preparation as quickly as possible? Go ahead with the fastest speed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow, sir." The chief staff member from the small box filled with markers Inside, I grabbed a lot of pieces and inserted them one by one on the big map. I immediately sketched out a plan. "The assault company and the reconnaissance of the regiments, departing within fifteen minutes, went to the various election headquarters. The guerrillas even set off within 40 minutes to maintain the order in the city. The rest of the infantry, departing within an hour. Cavalry and artillery as the general reserve team. There will be no written orders this time, and each company will act according to its own judgment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lieutenant Soledon, your troops will definitely arrive at the scene as soon as possible, and you will bring our position to Mr. Govar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stand? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will defend the Constitution by all means... The results of democracy must be respected. As long as the Republic is found to be in danger, you have the right to take any Action. I will take all responsibility for this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning behind this sentence is only half a minute to understand. "What do you mean by saying... We want to endorse the Union of the Federal Party and the Liberal Party by force?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is for the well-being of all citizens." Benson Waving, "Go ahead. This gentleman will lead you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing this sentence, the face of the messenger instantly turned into cyan. "General Court, sir! I am also a politician secretary, I don't have to..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But now only you know the most recent way to run for the headquarters. Rest assured Well, even if your boss wants you to sin for him in the future, I will find ways to discourage him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Benson's demeanor decided. Naimen suddenly found that this super boss had some strange sense of humor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the things are very logical. Although the "Warrior" is a force that is difficult to describe with elites, Sorelton's assault company is still above average. Thirty minutes later, he and Anne arrived in Kengal again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city is completely different from the morning. In the morning, Kengler was busy and noisy, but everything was still under control; in the afternoon, Kengler had completely become the boundary of chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radicals have ignited the city. Kengler is like a crowd full of bloody youth, with slogans, slogans and waving fists everywhere. Young citizens crowded into every street and declared their political ideals. I don't know who it was, first discovered the military emblem of the assault and even shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Central Army is coming! Block those who trample on democracy!" "The four-color cross flag will never fall!" "Unbreakable alliance!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They shouted, surrounded by soldiers holding shields, heading for the beleaguered federal party campaign headquarters. The only thing to be gratified is that these young people did not carry any deadly weapons, no one died or bleed, and the marches were basically carried out in peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All members of the shield, squeezing through the gaps of the parade! Put away the weapons!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The door is holding the tower shield, rushing to the front of the whole company, commanding the troops to squeeze through the supporters of these Federalists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his oblique front, Anne was wearing a chain armor and helmet that could cover the sex, waving a tower shield attached to a weak repulsive field, in the crowd. Take a road. It's hard to imagine that her slender body has enough power to swing this tower shield. Looking at her heroic back, Nana couldn't help but start to fantasize about her wearing a enchanted armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the Age of Elves, the three-pointed armor known as the Bikini has been found to be the most enchanting armor style for women, offering the most materials with the least amount of material. The defensive magic effect is enough to compare with the body armor. More than one hundred years later, the great magician Jung, who has made great achievements in the basic laws of psychology, called this a "collective subconscious": "Because people like bikini armor, this armor has gained strength." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be good to see..." I realized that my thoughts were not healthy, and Lieutenant shook his head and changed his mind in his mind. Looking at the crowd, I remembered the street fighting and disaster that I had seen more than once. "Speaking, I am the first time I have seen so many people gather peacefully... No more accidents happen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?! What did you say, Lieutenant?” Annie turned her head and asked aloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, nothing. I want to ask, do you want to help?" Nanimen hurriedly put away the unlucky and unspeakable thoughts. Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her unintentional speech just happened to be at the biggest weakness of the door. The teenager helped the helmet and replied: "Routing... Repelling the force field? This is a three-stage, wrong, four-stage magic? I, I am afraid I can't... sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde girl’s face passed the disappointment. "Sorry, I forgot..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was a bitter smile, no answer. This kind of thing is not the first time it happened. Since Anne; Sefer has become his adjutant, this young girl with a big nerve always assumes that he will be all magic, a versatile magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, Nana will also explain that the "all magician" on his file is not the meaning of "all magic", but does not specialize in a certain The meaning of the system spell; later he simply did not explain this, directly admitted that he did not receive the magic education of the class, not the magic that she said. Whenever this happens, Nana will feel that he has done something wrong and hates his ability. However, according to the regulations, ordinary officers must have at least two years of practical qualifications and above evaluations to be able to take the formal magic course of the Higher Army College. He is still 20 months old, or a man who can convince his boss to improve his poor resume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to make a big contribution... If you maintain order, it will be a big deal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is talking to himself, and the crowd in front of him suddenly disappears. Suddenly the dazzling sunlight hit the once-injured left eyelid, and the lacrimal gland was stimulated to shed tears along the contact lens. He narrowed his eyes and looked for light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the reflection of the opposite tower shield, more reflective than they are. The neat tower shield, the bright face, the familiar coat of arms, separated the masses of the parade. Compared with the unit that is in front of them, his proud assault is only a squad with no rules and no discipline. Their number is not even one, but it is obviously a regular military company that is much more sophisticated than them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The troops there, please stop moving! Explain your number and mission!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey," there was only one gun, and at least thirty guns were being aimed at them. Lieutenant hurriedly ordered everyone to stop moving forward, but it took the troops two or three minutes to get out of the crowd and return to the cross. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it doesn't matter, because the door listened to the familiar voice across. He has long known that these people are in the city from the routine notice of the General Staff, but the previous non-interference agreement allowed him to see these former comrades and partners until now. He took two steps ahead and respected the commander of the unit for a standard military ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nate Gate; Lieutenant Soledon, ordered to go to the Fifth National Division to help maintain order. But it seems that we may be more trouble... There is nothing wrong with you, right? Itis, Major General Eugen. Congratulations to the promotion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eagan spit in the mouth, In a satirical tone: "Oh? It's you, I haven't seen it for two or three months. It's a pity that even if you falsely report the record, you haven't risen to the official. Thank you for your blessing, our old comrades are still not dead. Light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis in the winter coat; Major Magnum was slightly wrinkled, hurriedly stepped forward, taking the rank of temporary Major General Eugen pulled back. "Sorry, his mood is a bit unstable recently. It is a common thing to miscalculate the record on the battlefield. Who haven't met us? Don't ask too much for such a young officer."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is very reluctant to refute them, but can't speak. He has no evidence. After all, Govar is still alive and leads the army...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He didn't make a false report, nor did he make a mistake. He did kill Radz; Govar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is Anne who refutes them. The blonde girl took off her helmet and held her delicate chin. She carried the tower shield on the right and took the first two steps, standing next to him and looking directly at Isis and Eugen. Faced with the most outstanding officers of the Free Army and their judgment based on common sense, she did not hesitate and retreat in her posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She believes in him. Nana did not understand where her inexplicable trust came from, but she felt a little happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing her words, the opposite of Eugen grinned disdainfully. "Dead? It turns out that we are fighting under the command of the undead. It is not easy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie! It's not the time to conflict with them!" Renaissance found that Eugen's anger had reached its apex and hurriedly pulled her back. "Now our most important task is to maintain order here!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh. Benson’s ghoul actually knows to maintain order, I don’t believe he has this awareness. Or is this your young politician’s idea?” Eugen, who always chews gum, squints coldly. "Look at it! If you are a soldier, don't bring your people here to make trouble! All politicians are in front of their citizens." Trembling, but what really persuaded them here is --"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Enough, Major General, this is what we should do. We should not interfere in politics, What we should do is to defend the people and stop the war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistance to the door, he saw the former boss, the commander-in-chief of the government army, it should have Dead Radz; Marshal Govar stood at the door of the Federal Party’s campaign headquarters. Govar, who just noticed the situation here, saw him, his face flashed a trace of surprise, and directly shouted his name and rank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorlayton?!...Lieutenant? Long time no see. Sorry for not being able to say hello to you, we are now busy advocating these passionate young citizens." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door looked at the Govar warm and even a gentle smile, and stunned. In his impression, Govar was always the elder who sat on the fort in the late night at Fort Vatican. It should be a lonely, lonely and desperate person, but in front of this Govar seems to have regained the courage and hope of survival. "Follow, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door turned and saw that his adjutant was staring at the Govar, and he was stunned with something. He frowned and patted her on the shoulder: "Annie, don't be in a hurry, it's time to perform the task. Let us persuade the soldiers of the Federalist Party to persuade them to be effective. Are you listening?" , "Less?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny woke up from her thoughts and hurriedly replied: "Sorry, I was thinking about something. I think we should be under siege. Are the Federal Party politicians escorting together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, you are right. Your cousin is still inside? This matter is handed over to you. Let me now advise everyone not to move on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand, sir!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Annie should sneak a sneak to the opposite camp and find Itis directly to discuss. The female major argued with her for a moment and finally could not resist her enthusiasm. She surrendered and let her take a few people to pass the defense of the Sixth Division soldiers. Naimen himself began toughly persuade the young people who are similar to their age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door did not notice that "Raditz; Govar" always looked at him and Anne with the corner of his eye. Until Anne left him, "Gowar" re-entered the work of persuasion with a subtle mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Party members of all autonomous parties, enthusiastic supporters! I understand that you want the feelings of Jules Autonomy, and understand your doubts about election fraud, but This kind of mood should not disturb the fair process of voting... Please believe us! Please believe that you voted for yourself! Only the most choices will become the will of the country!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long persuasion has been going on for a long time and it looks like it will last a long time. It is more difficult to use these words to convince these blood-stricken young people to be more difficult than imagined. His voice was a little dumb, but he continued to work hard to speak out loud. Of all the people around, only one person - perhaps two people - knows the true identity of this "Gowar". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis; Magnum looks sympathetically at the back of the old marshal. Only she knows that under this seemingly majestic body, only a weak girl is working hard beyond her limits. She is not playing the role of Govar, but is crying from the bottom of her heart to avoid crises and wars. "Fog Eagle" Istis's original responsibility is to monitor her actions, but now...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even if she knows that her behavior is not in the interests of the empire, she also Can't stop to stop Monica; Wei Lun. She can't do this kind of thing, so the effort to destroy others is too cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is the end of the matter, perhaps nothing is bad, at most it is just a loss of money."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
