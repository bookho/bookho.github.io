The Taiping Road army in the north seems to have been hit hard by the surprise attack of the cavalry, and no attempt has been made to launch a second attack. It only caused the scouts to launch several exploratory harassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the noise outside the city did not stop throughout the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole night, the sound of the drums and the marching forces of the troops are constantly heard, which means that the enemy has been mobilizing forces within the reach of the naked eye. The passwords that are shouted with foreign accents and the sound of military vehicles are mixed together, and they are adjusted with the horses, as if they were foreign operas, playing the prelude for the biggest duel of the former duel expert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he woke up the next morning, he was surprised to find that the enemy had formed a dense ocean in front of the entire manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Schlopp Cliff, with his red eyes, pulled out his high-volume binoculars and looked at the direction of the loud noise last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The telescope on the supply list is a pure gold system. I really thought it was made of gold."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this telescope, it is difficult to reach the end of the camp and the square, extending from the river to the woods, and extending out of the woods, disappearing at the end of the telescope's field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the woods, there seems to be a large number of yellow scarves in action, although they dare not approach the mango garden, but occasionally send sporadic shells in this direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can see a variety of Warcraft-specific Warcraft in the back of the enemy's military array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Cliff is familiar with natural history, he may be able to point out that in the air are Golden Eagle, Dapeng and Wing Tiger, and on the ground are war elephants. Snow hoofed dog and the magic mountain horse from the edge of the mountain range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the former duel expert may be aware of every weakness in the human body, but does not recognize these World of Warcraft, which is not common in the Coman area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either the Free Army or the Emperor, the long-lost wild Warcraft has not been used, and the Air Force is almost standardized horses and feet. The dragon is even a magician who masters the magic of delay. Not every kind of Warcraft is suitable for domestication. Many Warcraft can defeat the owner as long as the control magic fails for one minute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, these Warcraft are not recognized and do not affect his order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy has an air force! Let the magical warfare troops prepare to meet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those have never seen The flight of Warcraft makes Cliff feel a little thorn in the back. He thought about it and added a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, there are magicians in the Taoist army?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One from the Hengqu The adviser of the military adviser confirmed: "Are you a monk and a Taoist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, their magical warfare. They should be familiar with these Warcraft. Ask them to come and study together. I don't want to see those guys raiding our forts and logistics warehouses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander quickly leaves, Cliff is here Waiting for the Taoist priests of the Taiping Road to revise the defensive plan according to the latest enemy deployment. One company after another was inserted into the line of defense, and more troops were in the reserve team's position, always ready to cope with the overwhelming attack. Part of the cross-channel cavalry was reserved for the secret hand of the decisive battle, and the other part was used to fill the gap in the battle line. There are not many reliable infantry on hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander of the Yellow Turban Army in the West Bank, the deputy commander of this huge army, Ma Zhenglu, is also standing on the podium, looking at Cliff's position, the little mango garden. The commander of Ma’s deputy is set up in the open air, up to a few feet, with a cover of magical cloth, located on the avenue about one kilometer away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tool he used to peep at the enemy is a military monocular that is almost the same as Cliff’s, and is also made by the Pure Gold Group’s workshop. . This telescope is really made of pure gold. It is much more luxurious than the one held in Cliff. In the corner, the name of the product that was originally designated by Anne Sefer was written in Coyman. Telescope +2". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Senhu woman, on the wall of the wall, must be the red thief who broke my right army last night?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the inquiry from Ma’s deputy, Jiawen Alvarez, who came to the wind last night, said: Lei Jiawen took out a pair of glasses and put it on, and gently adjusted the right hand. Magnification of the magic glasses. Saint-Sen has the world's oldest ocean-going navy. Their telescope technology is more cost-effective but better than human monoculars. Even the export-oriented telescope designed by the Pure Gold Group for the Eastern princes and princes is not as good as Jiawen's glasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the rank of 'Colonel', about the equivalent of the deputy of your army. His commander's strength is about the equivalent of the three battalions of your army. For the Man, he should be the master of the place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the enemy commander, the elf female guardian helped the glasses, and the vision After adjusting back to the original, I replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her Oriental language also carries the bluntness of translating magic, which allows her to pretend that she can't understand the contempt in the tone of the country's commander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that she has no guilty about this. On the magic net, Jiawen Alvarez left such a record on the Battle of Puzhou: "The commander's commander in the West Bank is a general with barbaric origin, but it is a true East. In the life of his life, the victory of the goddess of war is often accompanied by his favor. This kind of luck makes him develop a very common character in the East: if the war is smooth, it must be because of himself. The ability to transcend peers; if the situation is not smooth, it must be because of bad luck, the Lord will be chaotic or subordinates incompetent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The commander of the commander of the three battalion It seems worthy of a fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma’s law spit in the dust, which he raised while fighting the nomads and undead in the desert on the northwest border. The habit of becoming. When fighting there, sand is a more dangerous opponent than the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand and gestured to the monk in his pro-team. The monk with a yellow headscarf immediately took two steps forward, half a squat in front of the West Coast Guardian deputy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The end will be dressed in armor, not full ceremony, please command the commander."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;马Anxiously waved his hand and ordered, "Let them fear!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This weird command made Jia Wen feel a little confused. She saw the monk decisively returning to the ceremony, stood up, and then took a yellow sign from his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monk’s finger glimpsed, the oriental text on this sign shines, the road itself burns fiercely, the color of the burning smoke is golden, and it rises to the gloomy In the sky. This golden smoke exudes a faint yellow glow, shining above the dark clouds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, another light rises in the neighboring camp. Then there are two, three, ten, twenty... until more than forty, fifty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly, sixty-two. Jia Wen did not know how to count, because her intelligence personnel told her that there were a total of 67 battalions from five provinces in the West Bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, actually only sixty... no, fifty-eight... fifty-seven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The female guardian’s line of sight stayed in the south and stayed behind the enemy’s position. On the avenue between Mango Park and Puzhou City, there are also several pale yellow rays of wolf smoke. The five wolves were raised one by one, accompanied by the screaming of the whistle and arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her scout scouts did not find this unit. The battalion cavalry that tried to surprise the attack last night did not seem to have caused too much damage to the morale of the Guardian Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the time, when the cavalry is still at war, the five camps of three or four thousand horses have already been sent out."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiawen calculates the distance between the wolves and each other. Whether it is a pre-estimation of the failure of the cavalry, or just to completely cut off the connection between the enemy with a great force, Ma’s discouragement surprised her. The Sanctuary Corps has no such combat habit of putting almost one entire legion into danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a commander and commander of the mercenary artillery, Jia Wen took the initiative to raise his own question: "This will use this squad, no problem, Marshal? It should be able to play a bigger role."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I often fight against barbarians, barbarians use our saying to be called 'fears and not De', this is also my favorite strategy.” Ma deputy looks good. “This sentence is a very cultural ancient text, can you understand, Hu female?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he heard such rude inquiries, Jia Wen did not show any dissatisfaction. She glanced at the translation magic in the corner of the field of vision, which read the words "fear of force but contempt for morality." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I am not very proficient in Orientalism. Can you ask the coach to teach me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Jia Wen blinked and looked at the horse with a gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the commander of the West Bank of the River of Waters smiled, he did not rush to answer. Several ministers and commanders ran to the command post and asked him for instructions. Ma Junlu also gave instructions one by one. After the end of the military affairs, he continued to explain to the elf consultants around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The meaning of this sentence is that to show the greatest combat power, you can shock these barbarians. The cross-channel is not the rabble, the red thief army is their backbone. How can such a good opportunity be missed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this is only a peripheral force. The South Coman people are very tough, they will send more Many troops, forcible attackers and blocked forces will lose a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jiawen cautiously reminded. She still remembers the battle at Jiawen Fegna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our army is so huge, some losses are nothing, what is important is how to completely eliminate this part of the enemy. Our army lost a camp, just like mosquitoes Bite bite; if the enemy loses a battalion, it will be an arm! As long as it can completely destroy the enemy's striker here, this news will instantly pass through the network they brought, spread throughout the enemy's army and the entire country!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse eagerly raised his head and waved his hand in the air, seemingly disregarding his own loss. "I have 80,000 troops, even if I lose two." The 30th Battalion is also enough to razed this little manor to the ground!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his movements, Jia Wen seems to understand something. She looked up and looked at the monks who circled in the low air and the flying Warcraft around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the history of the entire right path, I am afraid I have never concentrated on so many monks and Taoists who have reached the level of comprehension." Ma said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no coincidence that the dozens of Taoist users who hovered in the air, such as the eagle, rushed down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, in the mango garden, the officers of the Free Army did not find the threat of the air. They were also drowned in the previous horror and failed to respond correctly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello! I am afraid that our retreat has been cut off!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy has been confirmed A military line of thousands of people is between the manor and the city of Puzhou, and is building a position!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the young staff who panicked The veterans of the Battle of Lenny are more calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are afraid of harassing while secretly arranging a team of thousands of people to wading in behind them. Don't panic, if we panic, we are in the middle. The enemy’s arms are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you see--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young staff member standing behind Colonel Cliff is still asking, the colonel has moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clive’s figure flashed forward, his left hand slammed on the cheek of the first adjutant and flew him out for several meters. The colonel, who had been against the enemy, turned sharply and shouted at the officer's group around him: "Don't be dazed! Air strike! Flash off!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he Jumped off the podium and escaped the little black spots in the air that could hardly be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two flying swords came after him, tied in the position occupied by Cliff and his adjutant just a few seconds ago. More yellow mist hit the back of the fence and blasted into a yellow poisonous mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beginning." Seeing the yellow fog, the first time I saw the Taoist team used the air force's Jiawen Xiaodi to be surprised," This is very similar to the tactics of the Sanctuary Zero Corps. Does your air force also use poison fog magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course. Qi is a void, can be windy Flying is a part of the right path.” Ma Jilu laughed. “It turns out that you have an air force in Xihu? I can hire some next time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With more than two thousand years of air force history, the sanctuary and the Senate appointed by the Senate, who once had many real dragons, Jiawen Alvarez smiled and nodded: "If you can be a horse Shuai and Zhang Yushi's service."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she secretly pouted in her heart. Looking at the attitude of the general of the Yellow Turban, he must have thought that as long as he used the Air Force, he could easily kill all the generals of the Free Army and concentrate on the force to make a breakthrough; Jia Wen knows that this is not the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are almost no air forces in the free nations, and their enemies are the emperors and saints who have powerful magician units and flying units. Under such a disadvantage, the free nations not only do not perish, but grow stronger, that can only mean...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shield"!<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Energy protection!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the entire front of the Freedom Army, magical warriors and sorcerers of magical items let's move. They are not familiar with the operations of the Yellow Dora Air Force, but this does not affect their actions in accordance with the air combat regulations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About one-third of the Air Force - such as a magician - will use long-range magic and weapons to strike, this time the latter is needed to weaken the rays and fireballs The facial damage caused by magic; more air forces - such as various air knights and flying beasts - will take a dive attack, trying to decapitate the enemy's commander and artillery positions. Therefore, when the Free Army faced a flight force that did not know the tactics, it required the officers and soldiers at the key positions to simultaneously defend the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are many monks in the red thief!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Continue to attack, Daoyou ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yellow priests who flew in the air stopped, the wind formed a cyclone around them, and the flying Warcraft hesitated to look for possible attacks. aims. In the small mango garden, more than three hundred magical reactions occurred in a minute or two, which made them wonder where to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the flying sword that has been issued cannot be withdrawn. Two Taoists who led the air raid camp exchanged a look and decided to continue the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, more obstacles appear in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clean Air!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dark Art!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yellow poisonous mist in the air was dispelled before it came into effect, and in that little mango garden, almost all the key positions were covered with darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most frightening part of the air force is that they can attack enemies across obstacles and fronts. What they are most afraid of is that they cannot see the situation on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one who dares to propose a retreat. The Guardian Army is like a mountain. If a religious judge who is known as a "rape" and a superintendent named "Ghosts" are used to deal with the routing forces, then one in at least three people will be beheaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Offensive!" Seeing that the other party has sacrificed the dark sorcerer and prevented the Daoist Air Force from further attacking. The leading jurist has to bite his teeth and "dispatch the enemy." The military evil law, swearing its chieftain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang Wen, who was watching from a distance, saw the black masking magic in the Freedom Army and frowned. I opened my mouth and wanted to say something to the employer around me, but I still didn't say anything at the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma’s law took two steps forward, standing on the edge of the podium, holding the copper body of the telescope tightly with a hand that was slightly shivering: “Let Fuxi Zuojun sent five battalions to fight! The air raid battalion is about to kill the enemy generals, to seize the opportunity to break the enemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several pieces of darkness were dispelled . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the gloomy sky, the golden mans of the yellow towel technique tore the artificial dark spots. The winged tiger rushed to the soldiers of the Freedom Army, but was hit into the skull by a lead blaster. The whistling sound of the flying sword crashed into the purple light of the cracking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this chaotic battle between the Air Force and the Army, only the colonel of the Free Army is the most conspicuous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The physical strength of the middle-aged man has passed the peak period, and his skill is no longer as flexible as he is a dueling agent, but his experience is in the right place. The peak state in a lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Finger rabies" Colonel Cliff is able to get from a volunteer soldier all the way to the division of the Longgun National Division, precisely because he is brave, Brave to the extent of madness. As an officer, his subordinates often pay more than half of the casualties, but they can also achieve unparalleled success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a battle takes place within the reach of Colonel Cliff, relying on the acceleration boots, he is almost invincible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the roar of the light and heavy guns, Cliff's right hand's arm edge shuttles between darkness and darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiawen looked at the enemy's figure and couldn't help but raise the magnification of the telescopic glasses by one level. Although she expected the defeat of the Yellow Turban Air Force, she did not expect the enemy to be such a crazy melee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can his right arm blade fly out? This is also a custom made magic item."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three sharp edges of Cliff's right hand flew out from time to time, accurately puncture the neck of a flying World of Warcraft, and then pulled back by the invisible magic line. This kind of weapon is far less flexible than the flying sword, but it is also a weapon for the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw this, Jia Wen felt that she had no need to continue watching. The shouts of Ma’s law have gradually become irritable, and the number of soldiers has been more and more. She sighed, opened her mouth to the coach, returned to her camp, and began to arrange for the heavy artillery to be transported and installed from the transport ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The failure of the air raid camp was only the beginning of the day. On this day, as many as 20,000 battalions of nearly 20,000 troops took turns to attack the small mango garden, but the thin fences and trenches were insurmountable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, Jia Wen’s scouts reported to her that Ma’s law had sent three secret letters to the Zhangfu Tujia University Base Camp on the east coast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the middle of the night, another message didn’t even need her scouts to report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guardian army camp between Puzhou City and Mango Garden burned, and the burning red light reflected the entire Ruoshui River, being the east bank and the west bank. Everyone in the water camp can see clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day’s fierce battle and the fire of the night tell the commanders of the Guardian Army that they are not facing the border barbarians, but have rich experience and strong fighting power. Another civilized army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such an army can not be defeated by showing off the air force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving the warrant of the Chinese army camp, and let the Taoist who supervised the army check the waistband of the person, Jia Wen Alvarez left for his elf mercenary camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky today is a strange dark reddish yellow, the red clay on the field is rolled up by the wind, mixed in the overlapping rain clouds, see It looks like there is blood. The heavy gunners in the camp are busy setting up artillery positions, but the artillery positions are more than two kilometers from the enemy line, which is not enough to bombard the enemies in the mango garden. If the artillery position is advanced to the point where it can bombard the enemy's position, it means that the elf camp will also be bombarded by enemy artillery. This is what Jia Wen does not bother to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the shooting angle fixed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although knowing this, Jia Wen is still serious The land is asking about the preparations of the artillery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s all according to what you said, protect the people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an emergency, contact me through the private communication of Magic Net."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaving this sentence, Jia Wen was rushed to the Chinese army camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning of the third day of the battle, Ma’s handsome account had already withdrawn from the area and retreated to 1.5 kilometers. Yesterday’s podium had been burned down, and the troops that were close to the mango garden and the police in the forest also fell back to safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are only 30,000 coalition forces in the Free Army and the Hengqu, the arrogance of the arrogance is not weaker than the army of more than 100,000 people here. Centered on the hunting grounds of the Mango Park, the reinforcements built longer fences, trenches and defensive positions, and built a wall for obscuring the enemy reconnaissance and the Air Force’s line of sight, posing a battle to fight. . The front line between the Rushui River and the savannah is not wide. The front of the mango garden can only accommodate less than ten battalions to fight, but it is not so narrow that the generals of the Guardian Army feel that it cannot break through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jia Wen stopped in front of the new big camp and handed in his own waist card. After the monk of the monk who ruled the guards examined the spell above, she released her. At the same time, the voice of the battle came in the direction of the front line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked up and looked at the newly built commanding platform, and the ministry and the commanding soldiers who kept running and seemingly busy. A colonial gold coin was placed in the hands of the gatekeeper and asked: "Now the strikers are still attacking?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, there should be no attack. The side should be the enemy and the camp." The officer in charge of the alert answered the gold coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems like the enemy's attack is very frequent today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the morning I changed my post to Now, four attacks have been launched, one at a time. It is more frequent than our attack.” The officer bite the gold coin and sat down into the pocket. “Please ask the school to hurry up, already second. After the drums, most of the camp officers have arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the gathering is not going to be a drum, then according to the military laws of the Dao, you will be beheaded. After the female guardian officer nodded slightly and thanked him, he handed the horse to the auxiliary soldier on the side and rushed to the command post. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the podium, the lower-ranking battalion stands in a square, their commanders stand farther to defend the crowd, and some monks stand nearby The tower is guarded against the sky and the ground. The higher status of the school, the aides and the ministry are standing on the podium and on both sides of the cloth. Ma Jun’s face was gloomy, holding a long-haired squat with a silvery glow, sitting in the middle of the podium. Jia Wen quickly stepped onto the podium along the wooden steps and stood at the end of the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quarter of an hour, the third gathering will ring the drum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sir, there are still four camp officers not yet!" After the number of people has been counted, the department responsible for the point will report the return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’m rushing to go, everyone!” Ma’s law stood up and squeezed a few words out of his teeth. “Sen Hu’s General Lei Notify you that the heavy artillery is on standby, if those few attempts to bomb or change, they will plow their camps with heavy artillery, and don't have to pay any attention!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She went out of her hand and bowed down to answer the "receipt", and then quickly returned to the queue before she was angry because she had not squatted. As a high-ranking Guardian of Sansen, she does not want to bow here; she estimates that the current Ma Jun law will not be angered by her problems during the crisis. Wen speculates that this horse deputy is not really as self-contained as he performed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Ma’s deputy just looked at her coldly and then refocused her attention on the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy's reinforcements are the Hengjing Guards, and the 14th Freedom Division 'Zhuhai', the chief thief of the Emirates, claiming to be a Major General, The commander's strength is about the same as a candid commander, and the subordinates are the five battalions. Just like the five battalions in the district, are you scared to attack?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one dares to answer. This morning, the Weapons of the Guardian Army was weaker than yesterday, and several battalions were pulled up and collapsed. On the contrary, the Liberal Army, which was reinforced by the Force, was extraordinarily active. The farthest counterattack broke through the three battalions. With the assistance of the newly arrived engineering mages and monks, it almost smashed the camp that Ma’s law was stationed yesterday. If it wasn’t for Ma’s deputy, he would withdraw from the camp last night, and now all the troops in the West Bank who are loyal to Zhang Futu are afraid to collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts have proven that in the face of a determined enemy, the use of cannon fodders can not receive any effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know what you are thinking. If this line of defense does not involve the Guardian of the Master, then this situation cannot be defeated." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people were surprised to see their top sergeant. Ma Ji’s law has never been known for his understanding of the subordinates. This passage reminds them of Zhang Fu’s master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Ma’s law continued: “I was eager to send a letter to the Master and all the adults last night and I got their approval. I I won't force you to die before the enemy's defense. Thanks to the righteous and the teacher's care!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, he looked to the east, and repeatedly Worship. See the deputy coach made such a move, everyone immediately followed the bow. Even Jia Wen had to follow her body, but she just held her hand on the floor of the podium and insisted on not letting her knees touch the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just a practice of doing muscle and flexibility." The female elf thought in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people didn’t get up until Ma’s law stood up. The camp officers standing on the school floor are all red earth, but no one dares to bounce off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this does not mean that the enemy is invincible! The strength of the Red thief is still only a fraction of ours, and they are relying on it, but There are three things: strong firearms, strong defense, and well-trained discipline. I want to ask everyone present, if the enemy does not have strong firearms, leave their walls, trenches and fences, and lose their neatness. The formation and discipline, will you be afraid of them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone in the audience shouted out "Never fear!", then the officers of the weekdays are also Shouted up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now is this opportunity! Master Yan has arranged the practice of praying for rain on the east coast. When the Red Army is attacking again, it will let It rains down the entire area! At that time, the enemies who leave their positions will lose all their advantages!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone shouted "Day Long live the sergeant!" The officers shouted and bowed to the East in a chaotic manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If in this case, there are people who are going backwards, the law of the army is ruthless!" Ma Junyi grabbed an order arrow and distributed the orders one by one. The kings fought!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the military service was halfway allocated, the sound of artillery roaring came from the direction of the southern enemy. Later, the artillery of the Guardian Army roared. The two commanders came to the camp from different directions, and their mounts ran wildly and gasped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The handsome! The four battalions are against, aiming to attack the enemy! The enemy has led the team to go out and meet them!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are here, don't go!" Ma Jundu shouted. "The former army camps attacked, the Chinese army and the rear army camps! Lei Ke will, the gun camp will ask you. !!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jia Wen took over the arrow, and as Meng Dawei generally took the road and fled. She didn't want to encounter another scene where everyone screamed at the name of the sergeant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the benefit of the Sansen people and the Senate, it is really not easy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The horses left the camp of Ma Jun, and the women guards said to themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, more troops have begun to array, and the road behind her has already been shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander-in-chief of the Freedom Army is the newly recruited Major General Dubble Gao. In the traditional tactics of the Free Army, the National Army, which is poorly equipped and trained, is used as a shield, and the elite and well-equipped regular Free Army is used as a spear. The enemy's attack front hit the National Army, consuming a sharp gas, and then destroying the enemy's main force in the counterattack with a regular army that is recharged and prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since someone takes the initiative to take the initiative, it must be protected. Although these troops are difficult to defend their positions alone, if others see these examples, There will be more people coming to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Cliff’s fears, the veteran Gao Huo laughed: "That is of course. You too Have been fighting with them many times, even if they are victorious, can they still leave us so many troops outside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray-haired Major General has a whip, With the guardian cavalry to catch up with the infantry brigade. Behind him, the six-pound gun that supported the fire also left the position, and the cross-channel Guards cavalry who made great efforts the night before masked the wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four battalions of the rebellion were already in chaos, one of the camp officers had already died, and another one was seriously injured. However, the arrival of the main force of the Free Army has revived the four provincial battalions from the provinces of the province. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General adults, do not have to retreat! Now most of the camp officers are in the horse thief's camp, ready to meet Zhang Fu... Zhang will cross the river! Come to me In front of the Heavenly Soldiers, only the three battalions of the old battalion in the old camp were able to fight for one battle! As long as the cross-river army marched forward, today it will be able to produce a thief, and break the Zhang Wei against the guard and the river beach!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining two camp officers provided almost the same information after the meeting with Gao Huo. Since the military heart is so, Gao Hu sent a dispatching commander and a communications mage to inform Cliff, and he led the main force to go straight to the old camp of Ma Ji’s law yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are already several Guards in the front of the camp to defend the array, but it is not worth it in front of the sea divisions with sufficient magical forces, and the army and six pounds of light cannons. One mention. It took only two quarters of an hour, and the enemies on the front fell apart and fled back. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Guardian Army in the camp almost ran away, Dubri Gohau commanded troops to station in this larger camp for a temporary rest. He can already see the Dao Guoshuai flag that is five or six meters (one foot and eight feet) half a kilometer away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After a moment of rest, the artillery freely shoots behind organized enemies..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A drop of rain On the tip of the nose of Major General. He looked up and looked at the clouds over his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, it’s raining."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not surprised. In this season, known as the beginning of the dry season, there will still be sudden rainstorms in the central and southern parts of Murrayman. In the deep rainy season, it rained almost every day; even if it has entered the initial dry season, cumulonimbus clouds will still appear frequently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, in the Yellow Turban military camp on the east coast, the Taoists responsible for praying for rain have begun to practice. The entire history of the Eastern Empire was composed of water conservancy and praying rain, which is also the two main tasks of their central government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gao Huo does not know that this rain is summoned by the other magic user. However, the actions of the enemy made him realize that the generals of the Guardian Army thought the rain was a good opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain is getting bigger and bigger, turning from light rain to moderate rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the Eight Camps Yellow Scarf Army was arrayed in the rain, and the behind-the-scenes soldiers who had been repulsed to the woods on both sides also came back. Trying to block the connection between the two sea divisions and the dragon gunners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do they think that if it rains, we can't fire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The peace of the country is not known, our gunpowder is generally equipped with tarpaulin, musket And the artillery also has a rain cover?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't laugh! The enemy's offensive is likely to be more than that, so that all the magic officers are vigilant, the opposite is likely to have Magic with water, acid, poison, ice, etc. as the core element, ready to meet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gao Huo activated his body while drinking All detected magic and defensive magic. As an officer who has long been employed at the headquarters and is known for his cautiousness in combat, he also has a level of magical warfare above the average line. He is especially good at defensive magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the Freedom Army has tarpaulin cloaks and umbrellas, and all the magicians have entered the position and are waiting. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pioneer of the Guardian Army was rubbing against the opposite side of the rain screen. After a slap in the camp, the Pioneers camp shouted and rushed to the enemy. Ma Junji stood on the podium in the rain, without an umbrella, nor with rain, watching the battle on two fronts nervously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of intensive assaults, the unique sound of heavy muskets sounded and smashed into one piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha, dying! This is probably the last batch of dry gunpowder for the Reds!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that the enemy has become a shackle in the middle of the squad, the ministry of the horse is not so serious. These two days of fighting have caused them to lose many of their colleagues, and they have not seen such laughter for a long time in the military camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the light gun followed the focus of the gun, and the sound of the six-pound gun was also caught in the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The dying struggle can still have such discipline, it is really a strong army. Lose such a strong army, still afraid that the cross thief will not die?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ministry of the Guardian Army is still laughing, but the laughing people seem to be a little less than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy firearms, light firearms, artillery, light firearms, heavy firearms, artillery...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laugh The number of people is getting less and less, and less and less, until everyone is ashamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh. Hehe. Notify the East Coast, increase the rainfall!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;马急律Twisted and smirked, and the power of the right way, he ran his hands in a straightforward manner, and twisted the "refined enchanted telescope +2" into a spiral shape, resembling a traditional snack called the twist of the Eastern Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Supervisor Team! Retired from the latter's self-employed officials, all of them are stunned! If you can't beat this red singer today, no one wants to go back and see him. Master--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a bigger explosion. It was the sound of heavy artillery, siege guns and artillery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many cannons do the enemy have!" Ma’s deputy handsomely threw the telescope down the high platform. "All the officers of the scout team are eating?" Dispose of!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General, and slow! That's our shelling!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;马急律The news was shocked, and the hand grabbed the ordinary telescope of the general and looked at the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the positions of Zhuhai Division, the huge craters and the mud of the explosion are in sight, and more shells landed in the middle of the red thief’s artillery and infantry queues. . A variety of models, heavy guns with a gap of more than a hundred years before and after the time are all around the camp. It can be seen that the troops that launched the shelling have been prepared for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a Senhu mercenary?! They were aiming at our old camp from the beginning?!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A trace of anger over the hearts of the generals of the country, but then replaced by ecstasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The guns are suppressed, see what you do! Drums... No, pass the thunder drums with the Tao! !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Major General Dubble Gaohu shines with a faint silver brilliance, walks in the muddy rain that the shells provoke, stops in front of each position, and pushes the silver spikes into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One after another heavy artillery shells burst open in the fifteen-second interval, but were stunned by these silver spikes and his defensive magic The resonance has offset most of the power. Losing all the artillery and a quarter of the troops did not give the young general the confidence to lose victory. Those who were lying in the mud and dying of the Taoist friends would not destroy his confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he is an expert in offensive and defensive magic, Dubble Gaoho. He knows that defensive magic, if used properly, will be the most powerful in the offensive game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put the bayonet! These magics can withstand eight minutes. The opponent's heavy artillery cannot be adjusted quickly to become a firepower!" He is still alive for all. Under the order, "Use five minutes to prepare for the battle. This time, the charge will take down the enemy's camp!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain curtain is getting bigger, the Free Army The tarpaulin was finally unable to withstand the amount of rain that seemed like the gods pouring water down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the enemy’s heavy artillery has gradually become dumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five minutes are so long. At the end of it, all the remaining seafarers on the entire position became clay figurines, only the occasional shining protective magic silver. Light can also prove that they are the most outstanding elite troops of the Free Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the troops charge! Come with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are muddy and lose their muskets The Freedom Army soldiers stood up from the trenches, mud pits and ruins. Their figures are like rows of mud monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have proven that they can fight if it rains. Prove that you can fight whether you attack or defend. Now, they have to prove that even if they suffer such a large loss, they can fight if they lose their organization and discipline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the elite soldier who had been tempered by the empire in the battlefield of freedom and war, even if faced with such a disadvantage, he was not discouraged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A peace soldier who has never seen a religious warlord for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozen or so battalions that attacked before the Ma’s law camp were almost all smashed by the sea divisions; such a big rain made the camper It is difficult to reorganize the formation, and even the supervised team can't stop the defeated soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like cutting a knife and cutting a cheese, like a kitchen knife cut through the meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiawen Alvarez in the Elf Mercenary Camp changed his face. Her artillery can hardly be fired, but the enemy is so prestige, it seems that the West Coast Camp can be leveled at any time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't pack up the artillery! All Sansen citizens are ready to evacuate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the West Coast Guards Army camp, looking at all these horses, and finally picked up their own long shackles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have battled hundreds of battles in my life, winning more and less, and I have never encountered such a rival!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shakes the tip of the gun in the rain and points out a few fine mans. See the Lord will be armored, and the surrounding will also be covered with armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But even if I lose to the end, I have this long shackle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lost The last sentence is given to his own commander: "Let the priests send the traitors to the adults to quickly clean up the mess, otherwise the West Bank will not be able to clean up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No, you tried your best, Ma Qing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice suddenly sounded in the ears of him and the public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s my fault, I’m too young to look at these barbarians. The enemy really can’t be underestimated, so let’s hand it over to the seat.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice is very familiar to very few people on the podium, and they immediately collapsed. The rest of the people looked at the person who seemed to suddenly appear, and saw his uncle's colleague, and was shocked and stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by this time, everyone knows who he is and vaguely knows what the big man is going to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗣师大人!" "上上宗宗宗下!" "You must pay attention to the body!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Futu turned a deaf ear, just staring at the cumulonimbus clouds with his bloodshot eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My right way! Right way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shouted exhaustedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ray!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hand made a handprint in the air - that is, the gesture of oriental magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the end of everyone’s line of sight, thunderclouds began to flash in the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thunder did not immediately slam to the ground, but between the clouds and the clouds. Every time a thunder jumps over a cloud, it is brighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless thunders coming together from the clouds at the end of the distant horizon, and finally staying in this cloud over the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloud is so bright, like the midday sun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a sacred five-right method! No, it’s above that...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It's Thunder! It's the real Huangtianshen Lei! Only the top monks can use the thunder!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slim and gloomy middle-aged Flying in the air, flying over the Rushui River, the whole body shines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"落!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That thunder curtain, no, it should be said that the light curtain is in the middle of the two armies, and the arrow that the sea divisions suddenly broke into two halves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people exclaimed, almost flashed by this thunder. Many people have spent more than a dozen seconds to restore their vision again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Dubri Gaohao was almost directly hit by the Thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All his protective magic is directly penetrated by this thunder that has more than nine magic limits. He didn't even think about the "to die". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are almost all the people around the world who have been directly hit by the thunder, and die without death - regardless of the enemy and me, even the wounded are gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spelled the last breath, thought of the last order, passed through the magic net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order is "Organize retreat immediately!". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the torrential rain, this order was faithfully executed, and it also proved that Dubri Gohau’s seamasters were innocent of their freelancers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If my teacher is under such adversity, 80% can't do such a calm retreat."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander of the Gunners, Cliff, silently looked at the troops that had been withdrawn from the muddy and bloody battlefield, listening to the shouts of the horror of the Yellow Scarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sky is dead! Heaven is dead! Huang Tian is standing! Huang Tian is standing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Guardian! Guardian! Guardian! Guardian!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shout almost caused the whole river to vibrate and eventually gathered into such a sentence - <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Master of the Master has already passed through Ruoshuihe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tian Lei brought The torrential rain lasted for an hour and a half, and all the forces of the United Army and the Yellow Turban Army stopped their operations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
