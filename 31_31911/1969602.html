			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp edge of the snow. The muzzle of the black hole. Sharp spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young lieutenant officer is empty-handed. By his side, there were soldiers in their hands holding these deadly weapons; each of them was nervous and his face was full of alertness. Looking at such a tight protection around, the second lieutenant feels like a big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, big men and prisoners are often only one line apart. Unfortunately, he knows that he is the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd of hundreds of prisoners is also crowded around him, and at first glance there is an illusion of not seeing the end. Whether it is the caretaker or the captive, everyone wears the same blue military uniform. This evening, people wearing the same military uniforms were divided into two different camps, loyal to their commanders, and loyal to their government. Under the call of virtue called "loyalty", everyone has invested in the fierce Shura field that kills each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This very special coup night will be remembered in the annals of history by the entire city, not the whole world. Not only because of this fiercely turbulent historical event, but also because of the strange and incredible sky of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At midnight this evening, people saw a huge yellow fireball hanging in the middle of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evening, the sky is changing, the light is reappearing, and the faint white snow turns into a raindrop under the fiery sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even after the sun has passed away, he still feels like a dream. All his previous life was not as thrilling as this night...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, sporadic gunshots came from afar. The queue also stopped, and the soldiers of the government army dispersed to investigate, leaving only a small number of people to guard here. He frowned and knew that there was a sporadic exchange of fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The door is low."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company commander responsible for guarding all the captives is on his side Shouted. The young officer thought for a moment and remembered that this was his own pseudonym. He squeezed out the crowd and smiled and responded to the amiable captain: "Is there anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing, just want to ask you a question. I I want to register your troops and belongings," the company commander replied friendlyly. "I will help you prove your character and loyalty. Your military officers with a true sense of honor should not be convicted with the rebels." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit number? His mouth twitched slightly. Where does he have this kind of thing? He is a full-time officer. If it is not for the rescue of the friend of the childhood, Nika, he will not wear the military uniform that has been smashed from the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it’s a lot of military officers like me. It’s good to let me accept the ruling of your highest sergeant. There is no need to excuse me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest commander of the government army, Klad; Lopez, the father of the girl he went to save, is also his magician. As long as he is in front of him, everything can be solved naturally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A lot and a lot?" The captain’s mouth dismissed disdainfully. "I am not attacking your troops, but your colleagues are really bad. Do you know?" You are the only officer we have captured. The only one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone is killed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "No, they all took off their military uniforms and fled into the civilians. We didn't capture a few officers, but we captured a lot of uniforms."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of the captain caused a sneer in the surrounding soldiers. The false younger brother smiled a bit and told him that he was not actually a real officer. The officers of the coup army have been disguised as civilians, and the only captive officer is a real civilian... This is a living irony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell me your number. Is there any inconvenience?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He hesitated for a moment, and put it in the ear of the captain, whispered: "Oh... it is a little inconvenient. I am in Dico... Hey, Dico; the general staff of Major Limda is... oh, That is the one that cannot be announced, do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, after hearing his whisper, the face of the captain showed a surprised expression: "Is the headquarters directly under the army?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put the term in his heart While following his guess, he revealed an inscrutable smile: "Maybe. But remember, I haven't said anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Unexpectedly, he will soon see this "headquarters direct force" and become a member of it. It was thirty minutes later, when the company was attacked by the coup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just one moment, the entire line of defense collapsed in front of the assault of the tenth division. That is not because of how powerful the capital defense forces that are pampered on weekdays, but because of the elbows. Just as all the government soldiers were fighting against the enemy's offensive in front and calling for reinforcements, the prisoners suddenly had a commotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up and looking at the direction of the riot. The captives are armed with weapons and are bravely fighting the soldiers of the government who are guarding them. The two men who do not know where to come from are magically taking out piles of weapons from their hands and throwing them in the crowd. among. Before the caretakers and prisoners of war were talking and laughing, but when both sides held weapons, the situation re-emerged into a life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir! Chief!" The soldiers who had surrendered with him rushed in the direction of the Lieutenant. He hesitated, didn't know if he should fight. The countless eyes that looked forward to him seemed to be talking about his expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get rid of him!" A guard around him shouted and pointed at him with his weapon. In desperation, he had to start preparing to use the magic counterattack - although he did not want to fight with the soldiers who suppressed the coup, he was even more reluctant to die here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While his magical bullet hit the soldier’s wrist, a shining beam pierced the soldier’s throat. He was taken aback and looked into the direction of the ray. Under the faint kerosene streetlight, he could vaguely see that it was a female officer with two more stars on his shoulder than his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The little envy, be careful behind!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice is clear and decisive, the magic in her hands The idea is free to sway. The ensigns can identify some of these magic: that is mostly the ray magic used for remote screening. The battle of the government forces has been completely chaotic, and the two officers who have just fired weapons have also begun to enter the battle group. The head of the company commander who was still talking and laughing with him was rolling on the ground, and a magician hidden in the shadow was destroying the ninth company's command organization there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is coming to an end. The female captain jumped lightly from a height, reaching out and pointing to the south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone heads south and breaks out from the direction of the southern river! This is the command of the staff headquarters!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lesser feels difficulty breathing and stands on the battlefield. He was astonished by the change of fate. He didn't know what would happen in the future. He could only squeeze out a question: "Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are directly affiliated with the Staff Headquarters Force. I am Itis; Captain Magnum (edith, your affiliation and position?)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I am...I am Dico; General Limeda’s staff officer, Naomi; Sorretton, Lieutenant.” He had to recreate a lie—fortunately, the person who could expose the lie was probably dead.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are also a magician? It is very good to be respected by soldiers. It is rare." Captain Itis looked at the soldiers surrounded by him and sighed, "Do you want to break through?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton swallowed and nodded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- That was a week ago In this way, he became a lieutenant officer of the coup, and with the remnants, he retreated to Fort Worth at the mouth of the Metebeisi River.<br /><br />&n Bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he saved the childhood sweetheart, Nika; Wei Lun is working with her new partners in the town not far south of Kengal, they have been blocked here for three days The eighth division, "Glory", stationed near Kengal, blocked Kengal and the road leading to the north, and everyone could not pass it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this is a secondary issue. The main problem is that there is no money." Jett, who is in charge of financial management; Uncle Nyton reminded, "The daily cost of the team is too big. It is best to live in the best hotel. The food, rent the best carriage... Also buy new equipment often... Not to mention that a young lady often wears clothes several times and no longer wears them. They can only sell them at low prices. If they continue to do so, We can only stay here for another two or three days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone will look to the beautiful rich lady. Lei Fu; Namlock was a little panicked, and uneasily pulled the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, the source of funding to support your gentlemen's adventures, isn't it my company?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Jet touched the beard: "There is really nothing on weekdays, but now there is really no money, I am afraid there is no place to borrow. If you can go to the north, you can naturally get sponsorship from your home, but now... For example, Miss your jewelry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, Leifu bounced off the seat like a cat stepping on the tail: "Mr., the idea of ​​playing ladies jewelry, but there is no demeanor. If you find that you have no money, you should find a way to earn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All immediately Retreat to the house and start discussing other means of making a living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is only going to find a job?" Xiu Lan suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This small town of thousands of people, 80% are some local gang disputes like dog biting dog work." Jeter shook his head, "This It’s hard to work, but you can still try it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Or look for underground intelligence organizations, thieves’ guilds, etc. Recent situation Tension, there may be work in this place." Xiu Lan also suggested, "If you can't do it, go to the army and try it out. But now the situation is really on the verge. Joining the army is a matter of life. If there is an escort caravan The work of the class is the best..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonica, who has been listening silently, couldn’t help it anymore: "This, I have a problem. Doesn't the adventurer have any decent work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Decent work? For example?" Jette smiled a bit, "grabbing the guilty, Save the princess, destroy monsters?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nika nodded hard. "Like this, the kind of heroic work that is often seen in the general story, don't you do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several people looked at each other and reached a consensus. Finally, they were opened by Xiu Lan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not that you don’t do it, but this type of work is basically not in a civilized region like the Republic of Turk. It’s hard for even adventurers like us to pass. Levels, let alone all nights. As for the elimination of monsters or thieves... monsters, many more than a hundred years ago, but now only in places far from the southwest, southeast, sanctuary or great wilderness of civilization Appears. More powerful monsters, the well-equipped Musketeers and Masters will only be destroyed. Not to mention that it is on the eve of the war, I am afraid there will be only comparison... that... the filthy task can be done. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is another two days, the level will open, but you can still find some caravan guards and other jobs; now I am afraid it will not work." Uncle added "In this era of war, the so-called adventurer is actually about the same as a dog. It is a black-worker for all kinds of different forces. The ordinary people are impressed by the free mercenaries and adventurers. In fact, there is nothing worse than a robber thief. Moreover, adventurers are also very easy to enemies, and may be intercepted by peers or others on the road. Female adventurers are even more..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡I was completely stunned, and I couldn’t speak for a while. Leifu stood up, and some of the rings that were annoyed with a hand, put a silent magic on the heads of Shulan and Jeter; the two men’s tongues were numb, and they could not say any more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the two of you talking about common sense, or is it to scare new people? You are obviously relying on me... Hey, my company’s company sponsors it. It’s not a good idea to have an adventurous old-fashioned life. In fact, the adventurer’s life is still very free and very interesting. It’s not as exaggerated as these people say.”听到 < br 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到 听到<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not completely different. In short, most of the time, Miss Weilun, you don't have to worry. Waiting for DeLand, my family's adventure company can sign a good contract with you, and you can also attach the Imperial National Insurance. The company's insurance..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paladin hastily made all sorts of gestures, sometimes crossing the "x", sometimes crossing into "o" word. Leifu frowned, and pointed a finger to unlock the silence of several people: "The Viscount, what are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think, we Still hurry to vote on the results, let the lady say it, and it will be even more frightening." Xiu Lan answered seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Victoria?" Renee whispered to Uncle Jett. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His nickname is Viscount. Xiulan; the name Dimartel sounds too formal, so we generally call him Viscount." Jeter Explain, "As for voting, you can vote for each proposal, and our team will act according to the results of the highest number of votes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rive Slightly annoyed, I took a look at Xiu Lan and said, "Let's vote. I agree to find the index finger for the gang's work, agree to find the middle finger of the intelligence dealer, agree to find the army's ring finger, and agree to work separately. The little finger is erected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results came out very quickly. Two index fingers, four middle fingers, one ring finger, and two small fingers. Seeing this result, Parker; Tap did not say a word to go out to find a job, the rest of the people began to discuss what to eat for dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I started my own trip, I always feel more confused. Is the adventurer like this?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- On the night of the night, Jenny wrote such a line on the letterhead as the beginning of the diary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large wooden table full of intricate decorations placed in the middle of the room, with a huge map reflecting the entire Western civilization. The night has fallen, and the southern capital, Lenny, is immersed in the dark blue of the dragonfly. Light blue light emerged from the crystal in the corner of the room, illuminating most of the dark corners of this chamber. The girl with short brown hair stood in front of the large map placed horizontally, and looked at the pieces of the dog's teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twelve divisions, four militia divisions... no, five. Add the newly recruited militia division."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie; Sefer took a white "Bing" from the chess box on the desk next to it, placed it next to the point where "Lenni" was written, and then retired Two steps, continue to look at the board. The dark light of the magic crystal shines on the skin of the girl's white net, such as oriental porcelain, reflecting the cool luster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes swept across the southern part of the map, sweeping across the vast territory south of the blood-red border. Seven black pieces, six placed north of Lenny, one in the southwestern part of the empire, in the port of the Emerald Bay. Ten white pieces, three in the southwest, five in the northeast, and two in the archipelago in the southeast. According to the combat power of each division, there are bishops, knights, tax officials, and soldiers in the pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are already six, six, six, eight, seven, ten, a total of six regular military divisions announced that they do not support the interim parliament... plus the shackled Four militia divisions. Six plus one, six plus four. Was the previous peace cabinet already so unpopular?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really tricky The situation, she thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost the entire Jules are under the eye-catching black pieces. Now they have a partial strength advantage, cutting the army loyal to the government into two paragraphs; they are still in the interior position, and can travel to the government forces divided into two areas at a faster rate. They also have more elite troops, experience in the front of the Fort Stilt and the terrible Emperor Guards. The difference in combat power is reflected in the pieces: in the six northern black pieces, there are two knights, two bishops and two soldiers. In contrast, there are six in the white pieces, which are soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these elite, powerful and loyal "freedom forces" have turned their backs on the elected government they should guard. They defeated the defeated army of Fort Vatican, the former staff chairman Radz; Margaret Govard expressed support and denied the legitimacy of the interim parliament and the government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She not only knows, but also knows very well. Because she is from a later generation, she can see another history of later generations - in those history books, writing a possibility that has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s true that the coup has been going on for a week, things have changed a lot, and they are very different from what she knows; but the preconditions are not with history. The change has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gustav; Hugh; Cole’s Royal Legion still exists, they have sharpened their fangs and claws. The Royal Legion was built by the Emperor's uncle Dirstein and followed Loebren; Feng; the system and tactics set by the Duke of Fegota, and after the reorganization of the young emperor, had the power to cross the times. The vast majority of historians believe that this army is the most powerful army in the Age of Enlightenment, and may also be a number of elite soldiers in the history of the entire civilized world - although their final outcome is extremely fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, this coup will fail, and the Lord and the Party will regain control of the regime. The most powerful force in the history of the Coleman Empire will attack Fort Stilt in the spring of the following year, and destroy the entire Free Army Northern Military Region in the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic, and enter the Lenny in the fall of 66. Under the city. Independent field artillery, concentrated magician units, and tactics for brigade as a mobile unit...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About, the military in the Northern Military Region has This kind of future has a hunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought, picking up the newspaper on the side. It was a "Delland Times" three days ago, with a large section titled "The Emperor's Majesty expressed serious concern about the situation in the South". The content is "The Emperor's Majesty hopes that the southern insurgents will be able to abandon the dark and declare chaos." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that the Eastern military law says, "The best military strategists use strategy." Because of the expansion of civil strife, at least in the spring of next year, no, before the fall, the emperor will not go south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a ridiculous causal relationship. Just a signal of a coup can let the emperor go south; and there is a thought of "strategic victory," but Let them stop south. The strategy of history is never the best solution..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And herself? In this change, can she find the best solution to history? Now she is not a bystander, nor a recorder, but an authority. The action plan is ready, leaving only two choices of “doing” or “don't do it”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do it, or not?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl pulled out a gold coin and gently bounced it In the upper half. The gold coins flew in a beautiful arc, rotated, and finally fell on the map, knocked down a "Knight" piece and stopped. She saw the side of the slanted cross and looked up and laughed. Fifty percent is not the optimal solution, but it is not the worst solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie uses the index and middle fingers to pick up gold coins. At the moment when the gold coins were removed from the map, she suddenly noticed that the location of the gold coins was exactly the kingrad of the Republic of the Ruhr. A shudder ran across her spine, as if the plan had been smashed by fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, she said to herself. The current situation has proved that fate does not exist. In this world, there is no fate, everything is just a chance. Faith determines power, contingency determines necessity, and probability determines the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snoring of the magic spell came from outside the darkroom, the door gently slid open, her sister Reese; Saphir came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are here again, Bonnie. Haven't made a decision yet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it has already been made." Sister smiled. "Although certainly not the best solution, it is not the worst."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really "Would you like to go to Fort Fort or DeLan?" Reese asked with interest. "Or do we go alone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need. Sister, you. Stayed at Lennie, and I went to Kengal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riss walked to the map and picked up the knight in Kengal After reviewing it for a while, it was replayed. "Kengler? Why? In what capacity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
