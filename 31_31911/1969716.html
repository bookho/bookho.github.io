If it is in DeLand, Lenny and even the Port of Continence, this season should be named "Winter"; and in the depths of the Yellow Turban Taiping Road, which is much lower than their latitude, this season only means that the rain will be better than in the middle of the year. Most of the time, the climate is still very warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The port where they are parked, called Gawinfigna, has been rented for about 130 years. It has an unusually tacky nickname: "The Pearl of the Elf Queen's Crown", one of the three colonial home ports of the offshore fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before renting the city in Sanson, it has a history of nearly a thousand years called "Guizhou" and a more distant, unrecognizable prehistoric history. . Later generations of religious historians will test a lot of lost ancient religious history records here, but now there are only the elves of the sun god priests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spokesperson of the Sun God, like the yellow priests who occupied it here, happily requisitioned the remains of ancient religions as their temples. But they are all worried, not knowing how long the port can stand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three months have elapsed since the Free Navy and the Sunshine Navy tore the face and began to smash the enemy merchant ships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The naval generals who have been lucky have earned a lot of money, and the unlucky merchants have lost their cliffs and jumped into the sea - this is a private plunder. It is like a stock market: someone makes money, someone loses money, but there is always a general direction, either up or down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Sunshine Elf Navy is the one that draws the falling arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eruption of the fleet-level warfare can not be said to suffer, but it can not be said to be cheap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it seems to have such an advantage in the exchange ratio of ships, the overall number of disadvantages remain unchanged. It is necessary to rely on this advantage to consume the Red Fleet. I am afraid it will take several years or even ten years. At the same time, the former Imperial Fleet had no idea where to go, and the strongholds along the coast of Interlake were also removed one by one by the Free Land and Navy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not the worst. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the overseas colony is the hand and foot of Sansen, then the big merchant fleet is the blood of Sansen. This blood has been inflicted here for three months... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women's guards of the Sansen Joint Fleet looked at the huge fleet and lamented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all the elf women who are still in adolescence, she has a cool and beautiful appearance, a smooth skin that can be broken, and a mysterious temperament that human women can't match. . However, she was almost in adolescence from the time when the Lenny had broken the South Governor’s Office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young female escort officer, gawinalva<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ez) This year is less than a hundred years old, and even did not witness the beginning of the first free war. In the elf society is an unquestioned young man. Her hair is not shaped like a female elf of centenary or even a hundred years old. It is simply braided into several long ponytails, sandwiched between long hair and shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if you sink a few ships, or kill hundreds of sailors, you can't change this trend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To become a two-sea fleet with such a young age One of the three escorts, in the elf regime that is accustomed to seniority, Jiawen is already a miracle. The reason for this status is that she is a great elf explorer, the granddaughter of Pedro Alvarez, and the daughter of the distinguished elf strategist, Calicut Alvarez. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hundred and seventy years ago, it was Pedro Alvarez who discovered the colony of Nanxinzhou; one hundred and thirty years ago, it was the card. Likat Alvarez captured and rented the city for the saints on the edge of the Yellow Turban, and named him his wife's name, "Jiawen." More than thirty years later, Calicut’s wife died of dystocia, and the daughter she gave birth inherited this glorious name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, the so-called "Jiawen Fegner" means the port of Jiawen Alvarez. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can it be changed if all the chips are bet on a desperate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She Looking to the huge fleet. At the farthest end of her sight, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jia Wen finally couldn’t help but stepped on the anchor pile in the port and used his right hand to throw the hand. The order book of the Senate made of silver was thrown away from the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether the ages are still in the hands of the Senate, this is a set! Even the cruel emperor of mankind knows that he wants to give power to his general! This kind of arbitrariness The order will really ruin the entire two-sea fleet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the mouth is so stunned, Jia Wen still strokes a gesture with his left hand , activated the magic on the left hand ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She figured like a petrel in the middle of the sky, caught up with it when she ordered the silver tube to fall into the sea, and regained it in her hand. . Although there are many dissatisfaction, she is still a high-ranking escort officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailors who are busy preparing to sail on the boat have raised their heads and looked at her light figure across the mast of the merchant fleet. Envy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the pure blood elf, and the magic can be used casually..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, you don’t know if it’s a pseudo-semi-elf, a fake half-elf, or a wild-semi-elf fellow. But the family’s pure blood is the same as yours?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, this whole fleet has thousands of ships, and I don’t know if there are thousands of pure blood..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s really enviable to say that there are dozens of laps around the world. If we want to wrap around dozens of laps, do we have to live so long?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Jia Wen will certainly not hear the gossip of the sailors. What she is going to rush is the current flagship of the Sansang two-sea fleet, "The Sun God, Joseph." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is flexible in walking between the forest-like masts, but it seems to return to the illusion of the hometown of Sansen. Soon, the largest and tallest tree in the forest appeared in front of her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Joseph" is the largest and strongest of the two seas, and perhaps the largest and strongest ship in the entire civilized world. There may be one or two giant ships in the inner sea fleet of the Coleman emperor, but they did not follow the Imperial Expeditionary Fleet to the southern waters, probably still parked in the harbor of DeLand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very easy to identify the giant ship named after the only main god, the sun god, because its mast is alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five main masts are not ordinary oak, but magical creatures shaped like oak; even their sails are mixed with green Giant sails made of vines and branches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trees are strong, strong, and even able to sail off the wind, and never succumb to normal chain bullets or magical attacks. Thanks to the help of these trees, this giant ship is almost impossible to lose mobility - unless there is no wind at all, or the opponent can destroy all the elves that can use the wind magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"保保~民~官~大~人~来~啦~"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree tree of the Lord greeted her with a slow voice. Jia Wen nodded, grabbed a vine, and leaped from the top of the "mast" to avoid the busy crowd on the deck, relying on the powerful reflex nerves of the elves to land on the top of the command cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks around and grabs a purely half-elf that looks the purest of the elves: "Lord Dreane is here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, protect the officials. The Sansen people and the Senate are forever!" The elf of more than three-quarters of the elves had a tribute to the ceremony, "Intreau There is a singer in it. There is also ... Hedus Cotuz (he<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dosco<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;tus) The adults have arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the name, Jia Wen frowned slightly and his mouth flicked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My colleagues in Xinzhou..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current fleet has three people Officials, in addition to the permanent Offshore Fleet security officer and the Inner Sea Fleet security officer, there is also one of the new Zhou Baomin official Hodus Kotuz. He came to Jiawen Fegner with this year's Global Fleet and was trapped here like the two sea fleets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, his other name is more well known - "The Great Conqueror" Kotuz. With only three hundred people, I dared to go deep into the hinterland of the wild elves, defeated the powerful empire of the local wild elves and snakes, and created the great man of today's Sassen colonial empire. Don't say she or Intreus, even if Admiral Chiujilas, who has been in control of the two seas fleets seventy years ago, is hard to say in front of this person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiawen walked past several sailors and garrisoned seamen, and those people seemed to be a little shivering. The security officer immediately knew the reason for their squad--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I firmly oppose the fleet taking the North Road. The Xiankedi route is absolutely impossible, we will It was blocked by Pis Wayne!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kotuz’s snoring echoed in the cabin, it seems that she is not alone in opposing this action. plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you lose the two seas, for our elves, there is no peace under the sun!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the command of Admiral Churchill, or the Command of the Two Seas Fleet. And I agree with this order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;德Admiral Ray Wayne Mandrill "Intres" also stood in front of the chart and defended with a slightly weak voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Intreus. Once there is no fleet, our entire colonial empire will fall apart. The fleet must exist. No, the fleet cannot be absent! This year's treasure The fleet is no problem, and the two sea fleets are bet on the decisive battle. I absolutely can't accept it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conqueror's tone is not radical, but it is hidden The indescribable determination: Everyone will believe that this person will not give up if he does not achieve his goal. Jia Wen couldn't help but think that he had violated the Governor's order to enter the Wild Elf Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The order has been decided. The big fleet is going to sail today." Admiral Shen Shen said, "You know what our fleet is now..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jia Wen seized the opportunity, tapped the door gently, and pushed it away at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alvarez Guardian Officer?" Admiral turned his head and said hello in a calm tone. Even Jia Wen can feel that the Admiral is worried that she also raised objections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry to disturb, but my source of information just received the news." Jia Wen licked his left eye and put away the one that had just come from the magic net. Telecommunications, "The three submarines of the Red Fleet in Phase Harbor and West Lorraine have already sailed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kutuz snorted coldly: "Unexpectedly. We can't afford to sail on such a large fleet. Even the indigenous countries of Nanxinzhou know to take the initiative, don't say that we have been fighting with us for so many years."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then they will return to Hong Kong again. That is Wei Taiping, Wei Zhenping of the East China Sea. Whether it is a sub-fleet or two sub-fleet, he will bite it."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreveen’s fingers slid over the chart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have a trapped fleet of more than 300 merchant ships in the various ports of the neutral country, I think, the rest of the Coman expedition The fleet should be there too. We must join them in the north, then break the blockade of Wei Taiping, and transport the profits of the Eastern Company and the wealth of the entire Xinzhou colony back to the country. Look at a fleet that is so large. Being eliminated is politically totally unacceptable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's not necessarily." Kotuz corrected, "There is still a possibility. If I No mistake, every time Wei Taiping sailed, he took the army troops; they used this method to gradually break the strongholds of us and our allies around the Intra Sea. With this scale, they are likely to choose. Conquer the kingdom of the Sinketi."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conqueror’s finger draws an arc in the south of the chart: "So we can attack the sinky At the time, it protects the big merchant fleet through the South China Sea and bypasses the remote back of Imeia. San Sen. This is much better than gambling everything on the fleet battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we can't be sure of this. Every time the Free Army launches combat Every time we send a sub-fleet to carry out a harassing attack, we are always alert to the opposite side, ready to meet our main fleet. Is your spy able to confirm the distribution of the Free Army, Ms. Alvarez?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiawen shook his head: "I can only be sure that there is always an army on board. The main purpose of my spy is to get theirs at the center of MagicNet technology." Research."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My spy can't do the same. The flags of the Governor of the Port, the Seamasters, and the Dragon Gunner are still in the port, but I am not sure. How many of them have boarded the transport ship." Admiral used the knuckles to measure the voyage on the chart. "With Jiawen Fegner as the base, it is too far away. Everything that is far away from us will be Detected. They even have time to go back and unload the army to come back and They battle "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Jiawen took a deep breath. In her impression, the Admiral is rarely so determined, but she still wants to try again: "But I feel that if we delay sailing, we still have the opportunity to minimize the loss."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, if not, Ms. Alvarez? The fleet has missed four times - < =""="">-. You also know that the entire Sansen economy has been Bundled in the colonial empire, if this merchant fleet can't go back on time, not only me and Ms. Alvarez, but the owner of this fleet – perhaps not in addition to the Kutuz guardian – can't stand it. The pressure of the Senate. Perhaps even Admiral Churchill will personally command the fleet..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no time, the fleet is already -< =""="">-!" The Kutuz Guardian’s fist is heavily squatted on the chart, which is rare for a fame and educated elf like him. "Put up your Honglyastasi-style politician, Mandrill! You just want the fleet to fight, right, Interreu ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. You can't convince me that the fleet must sail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Navy It will finally tear off the gentle appearance and slap the hand on the table without showing weakness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can't wait here forever! If a fleet cannot defend its shipping, it will not exist! I know that you care about your colonial empire, But I care about my fleet! If there are so many armed merchant ships, I can't beat Wei Taiping, then we can't win in the future! The entire Sansen trade will completely collapse!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They can't wait forever! Then at least, return my New Zhou Fleet to me! If the situation is not good, then I must have at least one force that can defend my colony, better than those two. The power of the Xinzhou Free Fleet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the two alternated in the air, almost to wipe out Mars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You think that your wild elves and night elves are more important than this fateful decisive battle?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel that the fate of the entire Sansen cannot be placed on this gamble. You may not like the wild elves and night elves, but I think that they can accept them into the Senate and The elf society will determine our future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, then I will send your New Zealand sub-fleet as a defender. I hope you understand what is our greatest interest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Admiral Mandrill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And Ms. Jiawen Alvarez, I also considered your opinion. The offshore fleet must sail, but they I need a safe rear. I hope that the lady can stay in Jiawen Fegner. The official order will be given to the two later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence Let Jia Wen realize the great determination of Admiral Intreus. He has decided to drive all the opposition out of the fleet -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, she didn’t feel much dissatisfaction, but suddenly she started to attack the enemies she had never met. A little curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of naval general is Wei Taiping in order to push the most outstanding two army and naval commanders in Sanctuary to this point? What kind of sinister and deceitful enemy she faced with the two seas fleet? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the sun shine forever in our forests. I accept this arrangement, the Sansen people and the Senate will last forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiawen turned and walked away from the cabin. When she left, she did not arrange a dinghy, but continued to return to Jiawen Fegner with flying magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood on the terrace of the Governor’s House and watched the huge fleet slowly, one after another -< ="="="">- It was not until the sunset sun went down. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She imagined that this huge merchant ship and battle fleet connected into a long chain on the chart, sailing to the north of the city of Intres, to meet the unknown. fate. There, there are the most dangerous and fierce opponents of the Elf Seas Fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know how many of these ships can be parked again in the port of Jiawen Fegner..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The female sergeant said this unlucky prophecy with a voice that no one can hear. She doesn't want to use her own prophetic magic to confirm the answer to this prophecy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What she didn't think was that she only knew the answer to this question after only 13 days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard Calendar January 167 Twenty-fourth deep rainy season<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack started At the time, the harbor of Jiawen Fegner was not empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the big fleet has been -< =""="">-, there will always be some merchant ships and frigates out of the plan. There are always some ships that will fall behind for a variety of reasons, and some ships will reluctantly rely on the port for a long time away from the nautical plan. In the half-month period, a fleet of not too small was accumulated in Jiawen Feg, and there were always dozens of armed merchant ships and warships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchant ship that came that morning was slightly more than usual, but it did not cause the colonial port authority to be alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lazy afternoon, after a sudden shower, the lookout found that a frigate belonging to the inner sea fleet suddenly began to catch fire, and it seemed that someone was nearby. Lost control when practicing new magic. The head of the Asian Elf of the Port Authority decided to send a few free warships to solve the problem and sent a commander to the Governor's Office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor’s House is a typical Sanson-style building built around a giant tree transplanted from Sanson. A large number of rooms have been dug in the center of the giant wood, and a spiral multi-storey building has been built around it. Each floor has a terrace that can be exposed to sunlight and fresh air. Most pure-blood elves choose this place as their place to stay, and only a handful of wealthy elves who have settled in this colony have independent houses - most of them will also transplant similar Sassen giant wood as the center of the mansion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor is an elder elder female elder who was sent for this because he lost a few games in the political game of Honinari. Like every real elf, she doesn't care much about human politics, and the worldview basically stays between the siege and conquest of Sanitti Fegna. The female governor had wanted to laugh at such a routine report, but the Jiawen Alvarez guardian who was enjoying the afternoon tea with her was worried about such a report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she saw the shelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first to start the action is the camouflage merchant fleet. The warships that were originally scattered inside and outside the port were concentrated together, and they were not the combat formations, they became the best targets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need for explanation at all. The Free Army did bring the Army to attack, and they were indeed waiting for the opportunity - but not the opportunity to wait for Sinti. They have to take Jiawen Nasiti directly to ensure that the two ships of the two seas are nowhere to be avoided! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible? The Coman people are so bold and crossed Thousands of nautical miles to attack here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the anger of the female governor, the young Jiawen had to correct: "No, they are not Coman. They are The reunion of the phase port is also the Coman Rebel. But even so, they have indeed crossed thousands of nautical miles to attack here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘉雯The eyes stay at the end of the sea-sky line. With the help of the elf's eyesight, she can see it without a telescope. There, a little red sail is gathering, flying down the wind, and it seems that it will enter Hong Kong within an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go to the local corps detachment now. Alvarez, you order all the turrets to be ready!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jia Wen hesitated for a moment, and put away the idea of ​​following the female governor to the Governor's Guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jiawen Fegner's colonial corps detachment has only regular troops of less than 1,200 people. How do the invading enemies see more than this number... People are worried."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After ordering the gunners of the battery to be in place, Jia Wen called his descendants and maids and began to force the gathering of Jiawen Fegner. All the idle elves, half-elves, mercenaries who are willing to fight for money, and the merchant's guards, and the colony's arsenal and weapons merchants were recruited to arm these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her orders did not suffer too much: because the Free Army has begun to land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although after half a month of sea bounce, the Free Army looks like the military is still tight. Some people are vain, some are retching at the beach, the fire of the port and the fire of the General Guard have occasionally overturned the entire boat, but they still firmly hold the flag and rushed to the port of Jiawen Fegner and beach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the phase of the Hong Kong Army that has continuously captured the port occupied by us and the Empire on the coast of the Interlaken Sea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the construction of the position in the Governor’s Office, Jia Wen found his own information staff and asked him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The blue and white horizontal lines alternately represent the 14th Freedom Division "Zhuhai". The silver front with a red-brown background represents the Ninth National The guards are "dragon guns." I think you guessed it. This is the free army of the phase port. It is crazy to go so far into such a desperate situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the flag of the red star scattered on the blue background? The troops carrying the flags seem to be trying to assault our fort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As a human intelligence officer, he raised the telescope: "Oh, that should be the flag of the independent military police brigade of the phase port. In the intelligence system of the elves, this flag is commonly known as 'Red Star' and is the Governor of the Port of Hong Kong. The personal banner of Men Soledon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Governor of Phase Port? Is there a banner for Wei Taiping?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There should be no banner of Wei Taiping, but the number of all important army units of the Intrepid Army has arrived. The flag should be Shi Pu Cliff, um, and the coat of arms of Dubble Gaoho... The flag of the Navy should be Kazan Fischer, and there is a fleet commander flag that has not been seen. It seems to be... Come on? But I know the third naval flag, is the original fifth fleet of Daro Salami?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for these fleeting The name, Jiawen Alvarez did not care too much. The only thing that caught her attention was Wei Taiping = Pis Wayne, who had been on the sea for decades. Even if it was for the elves, it was a name that was repeated enough to leave a deep memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. There are only two flags of the sub-fleet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The battleship will not exceed one hundred. Sure enough, the enemy’s main force is to chase our big The fleet... As long as we drag them here, these ships will not be able to go back to the battle line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think it should be, the guardian Adult." A half-elf officer next to him opened the road and said, "Just rely on our fort--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His words are half-hearted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jia Wen and everyone on the Governor’s Mansion giant wood, staring at the red front line in the port, volley, charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auxiliary detachment responsible for covering the artillery base - of course, consisting mainly of locals who have no pedigrees of the elves - barely smashed four rounds of guns, but still After the total charge of the three companies, they smashed down and fled into the depths of the colonial port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These enemies are not as well trained as the Sansen Army, and there are only a few of them with the army, but their tactics are really effective. In the stage of shooting, each row used magic items with the army mage or officer, and created a bunker on the land of the port; in the charge stage, the main company's company concentrated dozens of accelerations, and several battles alternated into the battle. It took only a few minutes for the flank of the Elf Army to be completely broken up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are even more familiar with the use of low-level magic than the opposite Sansen Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you said that this is a colonial army? Or is it a gendarmerie?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the elf female guards opened their mouths again, they were not as casual as they were. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the doorman of the gendarmerie, Soleton, although nominally the Governor, is not the same as our colonial governor. I heard that he is free. The Marshal Marshal had a high-caliber elite and was responsible for the supervision of the entire military at Interry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jia Wen remembered where he had seen the name. It is on the signature column of several basic articles about the operation of Magic Net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really an opponent. Can you hold on to this charge if you change?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jia Wen glanced coldly at the surrounding people. Except for a few pure blood and quasi-pure blood elves that seem to have gone through bloody battles, everyone else has turned their attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, we must give up the field. Those who think they are qualified to be real elves come with me. We have to get the rest of the Governor's strength." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She secretly counted the number of elf veterans who had been beaten. Not very satisfactory, but it should be enough to impress the enemy commander. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the liberating Free Army landing force had just wiped out the auxiliary army, blew up two artillery bases, and turned around to point the troops at the port. The Sanctuary Colony of the Sanctuary of the Central District was organized by the Jiawen Fegna detachment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Those guys should have been new recruits who have never seen the real Elf army. Everyone, activate your gear."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the night enters, Jiawen Alvarez protects the officer from standing again Under the giant tree transplanted from St. Moritz, silently staring at the burning port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many boats left in the port burning, and the night sky is red with the burning turret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy’s main force is in the process of clearing. In the hinterland of the peace roads far from the Intra Sea. The red Free Army uniforms filled the streets, and the Sangsen giant trees, which were more than a hundred years old, also burned one by one - that means that the detachment and the private guards of the local aristocracy were removed one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Free Army even captured the local slave market and armed these people as cannon fodder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- That's because they have given up on plans to use their own people to conquer the Governor's House today. The counterattacks of the Jiawen organization left a deep and indelible impression on the Freedom Army: the elf soldiers with decades of experience are more dangerous opponents than the self-styled royalists around Interry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alvarez protects the officer. I now agree with your plan: this may be our last chance to evacuate... cough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiawen Feige The female governor of the country has been holding the giant wood of the Governor’s Office with her hands and coughing up from time to time. Every time she coughs, this giant wood will drop some yellow or red leaves, as if returning to the autumn of Sanson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the warm and humid Taiping countries, there should be no autumn. Every breath of the veteran is through the power of natural magic, which consumes the life of this giant tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiawen Alvarez is silent. She knows the Governor's injury. As a natural magic user of the Sansen veteran and the high section, when the army was in a disadvantage, the Governor tried to use his power rate to sharply attack the enemy commanders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she failed to rush. Jia Wen did not know the specific battle process, but under the robes of the colonial governor, there were several fatal gun wounds and a sword wound that could not be cured. Jia Wen has heard that the young commander of the Free Army seems to have seized a magic sword that was once owned by the imperial emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sorry to be the Governor who lost the city. You leave with the rest of the people and come back to our big fleet and come back. This is My Governor's Scepter, I can't let it be seized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like most elves, Jiawen Alvarez is not good at expressing feelings. Even in such a situation, she can barely squeeze a little bit of tears in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I led the army to break through."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women’s custodian just answered this, Pass the scepter, don't lean around, turn and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gathered the remaining colonial troops in the square of the Governor’s Office and broke out to the east. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Free Army certainly couldn’t stop them – or they didn’t want to stop, and didn’t want to pursue. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf army did not march far away, and laid a camp on a hill with water in the east to review the loss of the day. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colonial corps of the more than a thousand regular troops and the same number of local auxiliary detachments, the Jiawen Fegner detachment, have been damaged more than half, and the auxiliary detachment has been wiped out. The other half of the "army" in Jiawen’s hands only lost all the rabble in the raids of the Free Army. Perhaps it is not as good as the average level of the opposing Free Army, let alone compared with the saints’ army known for its rich experience and few elites. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we should also cause at least the same size loss to the opposite side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The supervised government giants, which was burned by Jiawen Feige, Jiawen convened the officers who were most trustworthy and purest in their bloodlines, and issued the next order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We need to find the Taiping officials in this place and then tell him that we intend to provide reinforcements and return the city to them."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd is noisy. Want to give up this huge colony that has been built for more than 100 years? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that you have a lot of opinions. But it is better to return this land to the peace road than to let the enemy build it into its own port." The Red Fleet will never get here, even if it will be burned to white!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiawen Alvarez looks at the place with her cold eyes The name of the city, which took out the name of the previous visit to officials this week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if she gives the city to the people of Taiping, she is not willing to admit defeat. She, Jiawen Alvarez, would rather be the destroyer of Jiawen Fegner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The peace officials in this place sounded quite high, the great guardian of the end of the land... I hope he has enough troops to move." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the stab, using the official body of the pavilion to write "Guizhou Taishou" (g<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;eatgua<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
