			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time goes back to the early morning of December 8. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been an hour since the beginning of the attack. Almost all the houses on the left and right sides of the central street have become ruins; debris and dirt bags piled up on the road, becoming a natural fortress for soldiers to avoid each other's guns and hand-throwing. Soldiers who were replaced by short weapons were smashed in the streets and obstacles that were difficult to distinguish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The defense of Seventh Avenue was broken and retreated to Fifth Avenue!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is here At the distance, there was no time for the rifle gunmen to load the bombs. They picked up the swords and spears left by their comrades and enemies and invested in melee. The lead pellets of the six-pound barrage could not penetrate the wreckage of the building; the self-propelled guns that the Klad Army was proud of also became the only means of moving and conducting fire protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Go ahead, heroic warriors! God is praying for you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "...all aiming at shooting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intense gunshots interrupted the prayers of the pastor forever. As the defender's coach, Clade; Lopez led a special formation of the hunting team, looking for the other support mage and pastor. This is not a friendly negotiation or a fight between the magicians, but a genuine war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you supporting the caster? Where did the attacker go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carat General De, leaning against the bunker, picked up the telescope and observed the other side's offensive. Countless battle groups braved the guns and penetrated the defense of the Lopez army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Another new serial number, this is the twelfth. The other party has invested in a reserve team."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hull; Tedwood kneels down next to the body and checks the logo of the deceased. Twelve companies mean that the other side has not had much strength... but they are the same here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Invest in the last company." Clad screamed, "Let the first three companies continue to reorganize."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, the remaining strengths of the three companies, together, I am afraid that even one company... No, one row is inconsistent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resistance of the 900-person squadron is less than two hundred people... Although Govar has lost about 2,000 people in the street fighting, he still has a much larger reserve. To add insult to injury, because the Lopez army's defense line is constantly retreating, their wounded can not be rescued. The current situation is no longer that 900 people block 2,500 people, but 200 people block 1,000 people. When Govar was put into the 14th company, their defense would undoubtedly collapse...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, the opponent’s offensive suddenly stopped. It is. The entire battlefield was unusually quiet, and even the invading soldiers of the coup army slammed back and listened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not far from the north, there was a rumbling sound of guns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gun sounds like it’s from hell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s finally here." Clad stood up and the blue light flashed away, killing a mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s finally here." Hull; Tedwood wiped the cold sweat on his head and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the self-propelled guns roared and the encirclement was finally completed. From that moment on, the two sides returned to the same starting line: they no longer have a reserve team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In retrospect, Clade felt that it was the time when he was closest to victory. Unfortunately, he did not expect the other party to break out so resolutely...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crad? Lopez?...Sorry, please take a moment, I Go in and report."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman politely repeated the name twice and retired to the guardhouse next to the gate, using a copper sound tube Please ask inside. Taking advantage of this time, middle-aged soldiers in casual clothes began to look at the house and the courtyard around it. As it is located north of the ring, it is fortunate to escape the flames that burned almost white on the north side of the central street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dipping through... His eyes suddenly condensed, looking at a dark earth that seemed to have been soaked with blood. On the piece of soil, there are thousands of tiny pits scattered by stars, tiny pits made by fast-impact objects. If it weren't for Clade's eyesight, maybe it wouldn't be seen at all. Each pit is almost the same: narrow, deep, with all the same scratches on the edge of the pit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three thousand... No, four thousand shadow swords."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clade Quick Step Approaching, kneeling down, carefully looking at the dense pit. He recognized the scratches at a glance: it was quite familiar to him. He does not need to count, he knows the exact number of small swords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One sword illusion, two illusion four elephants, four elephant illusion gossip, gossip complex into sixty-four hexagrams, sixty-four hexagrams self-born four thousand Zero-sixty-sixth heavy sword, one of the ten swords in the world, 'empty'... Have you come to this distant place, Yunhai brother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The memories of the past on the true Xiuling Mountain overlap with the sword marks in front of them. The clearest memory is before the white man with the track number "Cloud Sea" travels to the East China Sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The original world is round? We call it the East China Sea province. Is it actually in your west? If I have a chance in my lifetime, I really want to go there and have a look. You came to us to see the world, Ruide?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there is a chance, let us In the East China Sea province...or my hometown meets. My country is called the 'Republic of the Union'. If there is an opportunity, we can see you again. All the way, Yunhai brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clade gently picked up the little sword at the waist and brought it up. The blue light flashed without it - no resonance occurred. He could not feel the resonance between Feijian and Feijian, and he could not feel the information of the owner of the sword. The sword is in the people, and the sword is dead. If he does not feel the existence of the sword, there are only two possibilities - the master of the sword has died, or he has left the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is Klad; Lieutenant General Lopez. Please ask me what is it for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magnetic sound is smooth and gentle, and there is a hidden edge; at that moment, the general even felt that it was like the voice of the hollow master. He stood up and turned his head. In front of it is a handsome face that is faintly impressed, and a pair of ears that are not sharp. At that moment, he immediately knew that he was the person he was looking for: the person in front of him seemed to be the embodiment of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the battle last night, with the help of Mr. Stewarhaus, we were able to retain the next half of the river fleet. I mentioned that I wanted to hire him. The inland river fleet, but he refused - he recommended you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sea dragon with a gentle smile, and the first of the cold and solemn Lu Zhiying Formally met. Seven years after a certain history, the dragon and the eagle would have played a gorgeous town soul song on the edge of DeLand together with the behemoth named "Holy Empire". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go back to the previous night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The direction of the ninth company was broken by... the main force of the enemy has been following the sixth street assault to the south."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrival of this news is like a blue sky. Clade’s face still looks cold as usual – he just dropped his pistol into the ground without saying a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Radetz; Govar really is worthy of being a warrior, and he found the only way out so quickly. He is putting all the attacking magic. Is the division a general reserve team? The concentration of divisions and even all the magicians at the headquarters can indeed tear a path in front of us.” Major Hull nervously calculated the current situation, “If you are back from the side, then ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the cavalry even inform all the company, collectively turn south and annihilate all the enemies seen. We must race against them." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go south! Every soldier of the two armies received this order. No matter who you are, you can win if you get back to your opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Central Square, South 1st District, South 2nd District, Government Building, South 3rd District...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;A fierce gun shot, violently stopped the pace of the Lopez army. A cannonball hit the self-propelled cannon and made a deafening noise. When people reacted, they realized that the gun had been hit by a giant hole in the 24-pound shell. This is the third gun lost by the Lopez Army tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fleet shelling!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers stopped and hurriedly fell down. In front, there were thousands of coups who were crowded. Their morale had collapsed and they were rushing to the transport ship. Even in the middle of the race, Gowar has actually gathered almost all the defeated soldiers and prisoners, and has a huge team of about 5,000 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation has become extraordinarily severe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, this is not the case, we must withdraw the scope of the guns!" Hull shouted in the roar of the guns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can we just watch them reorganize their troops with water?" The eagle Krad on the ground clenched his fist. "Who knows what to do?" Dealing with ships?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I think it’s about to destroy their sails first, weaken their power, and then occupy the fort on the shore...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you will go to occupy the fort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the order, Krad tightened the "broken dream". Only use dangerous tricks, he thought. He turned into a blue light across the sky, and the flying sword in his hand broke every sling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, an inconspicuous dinghy leaned on the battleship, and the silver-colored samurai sword was unsheathed. Katzmi had a sly smile on his face and wanted to get a few boats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the smile on the face of Margaret Margaret, who still dominates, freezes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sail, as the blue light flies, one side after another, and soon makes the majority; the ship, under the bombardment of a rebellious ship The sinking of one ship after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the inland river fleet that had not been in combat for 20 years was quickly in a state of collapse like the passengers on it. Radz; Govar looked at him and thought that the important troops had been withdrawn, and ordered the ship to flee. He only took away five transport ships, two thousand elite troops who barely managed to maintain morale, and abandoned the rest of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Awful! Let them run the main!" Kazmi sighed and released the steering wheel. In the brief exchange of fire just now, he has already dropped four, sank two, and controlled two boats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you also a river fleet? You can hold on to being a true soldier of the Free Army. You are very good." The middle-aged voice is awe-inspiring from him. The back sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry... I am just a pirate." Katzmi turned and said, "I seem to have seen you there... Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crad; Lopez, the commander-in-chief of the repressive army. Pirates? That's okay. Do you want to be the commander of the river fleet?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Katzmi replied without hesitation. "I am fed up with the life of listening to people. If you want to give me a prize, give me a good boat." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I appreciate the ability of you and your ship to sail. No matter what means, I will find a way to leave you...if I don't Guess wrong, you should still be on the wanted order, Hull?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Hull frowned and thought: “The Japanese knife...you are Kay Zimi; Stehaus? Your reward is ranked 11th in the open sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Has it fallen to the eleventh?" Katz Rice spread his hands, "I can't help you." But I can recommend a person to you...that is a naval battle genius that is not known."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out to be..." Half-elf Kikawi sighed Tone, "Sea war genius? That may be acclaimed... I have never independently directed a ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fleet...! The half-elf's eyes lit up, but then dimmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To say that it is a fleet, in fact, only one-third of the fleet, several 'fluyt' and several 'blazers' ( "Exploiter" class of boats. The other two-thirds have fallen into the hands of the coup. This thing may be difficult for some strong people..." Clad said seriously, "but the pirate told me if it was you You can do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is you, you can do it... Kakawi painfully pressed his forehead. The serious expression and serious words of this middle-aged man in front of him made him hard to resist. However, he did not want to give up the leisure life here...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I promised you to replace you, General Lopez. But you have to make sure that he gave him the completeness of the river fleet. Command. Can you swear by your reputation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when, Leisha; Helmont also appeared on the grassy side of the pit . The half elf turned his head in surprise and looked at the woman he admired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reza...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think, I can't monopolize your life. To complete your dreams, I will wait for you." The blond alchemist pretended to slap the hair and twisted her head. She felt a tingling tinge in her heart and hurriedly put a smile on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard; Kakawis snorted, patted her on the shoulder, looked at her softly, did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young is so good..." A little bitter smile came out from the corners of middle-aged people who had been completely insulated from their feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I swear by my reputation and identity that I will hand over the command of the river fleet to Mr. Kaikawi at any cost. Now, you can accept Is my request?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was just expelled from the Elf Navy and hired by the Free Army Navy, is that okay?" Kakawi was not at ease Ask, "I am a half-elf..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In our republic, citizens of all races are born equal. If you don't accept it, I will still Come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, I accept. I don't have to swear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing casual wear Lieutenant General raised his right hand: "For freedom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For freedom." The half-elves also raised his right hand and sweared down the voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you appoint a book, you will arrive within a few days, and some procedures will be completed. All the battleship captains involved in the coup will be tried. And the punishment for demotion; you can arbitrarily appoint your person as the captain. And... I want to ask a very personal question." Clad looked at the 4,096 pits under his feet and said, "You guys. Have you ever seen an oriental foreigner in white clothes? These pits on the ground are his flying... No, traces of magical weapons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When she heard this question, Reza’s eyelids jerked. Wearing white clothes...foreign people? Magic weapon, is it...? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oriental? What kind of?" Kakawi recalled. "I didn't have much impression last night. What kind of magic weapon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cradd hesitated and took out his "broken dream" from his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The little sword like this is just red. If it's nearby, I should be able to detect it with magic."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kikawi a clap: "That, it seems to have been seen..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, there was a yesterday The white man passed through here and helped when we were in a hard fight." Leisha suddenly came in. "He stood on the roof, and then licked the sword, he sent out countless phantom swords. With an alchemy From the perspective of the warlock, it is probably a magical item similar to an energy storage type. It must be stored in a lot of magic to send out once..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, that's a soul-linked magic item. Its power comes from the user's soul. Does he say where he is going next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh... no, he just passed. I can ask, who is that person?" Reza, while coping, considered the new information she had just received. Soul link... Was this technology? No wonder that the person used to be so powerful. Is it possible to use the magic loop and the energy storage system to make up for this magic difference? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is studying with me... Hey, a friend of Oriental Magic. We have promised to meet in this distant sea if there is an opportunity. "Cradd looked at the distant sky, plain and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza took a sip of cold, shed two drops of cold sweat, and forced to calm down: "...I wish you find him soon."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." After thanking you, the hero who saved the freedom went out alone; his back was very lonely in the cold wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, the two sisters, Reese and Bonnie, are enjoying this historic scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the South get a good naval general so early, it seems a bit difficult to calculate..." Bonnie frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There should be no problem, I think. Anyway, history is chaotic, and it doesn't matter if it is messy." Reese faintly said, "Even if the world has changed, The character of the person will still not change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...呃, but I feel that you are not qualified to say this because the world changes and follows the changing sister. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this ridiculous Reese immediately retorted: "So, Melina, do you think you are now qualified to say the word 'calculation'?" What caused you such a big shift in history?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least, the scope of the victim is small, and the number of casualties is also small?" Sister argued strongly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The number of soldiers injured may not be smaller than in history. As for the casualties of innocent citizens, it is only smaller than in history when the civil war did not break out. It’s good or bad, it’s hard to say now...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie suddenly interrupted: “So let’s stop this happening in history. The civil war is good. If you have lost your goal, this will be a good goal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, Resie stunned and stopped Arguing. "Let's go...stop the civil war?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Since we are destined to be unable to maintain history, why not let history evolve in a better direction? We You can create a better world than the actual history!” The brown-haired girl clenched her fists. “There will be no 30-year war, no foreign invasion, no unnecessary war, no more. There is a civil war! There will be no religious cleansing, no massacres, we can let modernity come ahead! In this era of historical change, we can do it. We have the knowledge of two hundred and fifty years ahead. , technology and magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this her true thought? For a moment, Reese actually felt that her sister became a stranger. What appeared in front of her eyes was an astonishing ambition, and even more amazing ambition than the so-called "savior" or "great man." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She actually wants to reshape the entire era! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible? You can't get around the inevitable cost of all times!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, we can't get rid of all the costs, but we can at least alleviate the vast majority of them. We are not trying to reduce the dark age of 30,000 years to a thousand years, we only need to reduce half of the losses. Okay. Think about how many historical sites we can save and how many lives can be saved!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Can you give me some time to think about it? Li? After all, we still have time." Reese reported that it was a sneer or a smile that was a bitter smile, and turned and walked outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are you going, sister?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
