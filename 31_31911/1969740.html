Due to the fragility of the Second Empire itself, the Magna Carta that was originally signed is still the weakness of Coleman, which gives the Coman nobles too much autonomy. In a sense, it is precisely because of the aristocratic politics that it led to the occurrence of civil strife in the South. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Centralization (central:4(feudal)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred empire’s centralization can be said to be Very poor. The five largest principalities have limited responsibilities to the emperor. But one thing to note: the emperor has strong control over his own territory. Especially after the war of elves, the emperor’s collar has continued to expand. The Principality and the Houguo have all become tense. In addition, most of the following assessment criteria refer to the Emperor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Openness vative): 5 (Thought Control)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred empire’s ideological control is strict, especially for the control of magical technology, it can be said that the suppression is quite powerful. All magicians must register with the Arbitration Association, and the expelled or foreign mages will be pursued. Civilians have little access to education. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade: 9 (Merchantism)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade of the Empire is solely for strengthening The treasury exists, the tariffs are heavy, the blockade is very strict, there are quotas for all imports and exports, and there are a large number of public goods. With the support of the imperial economist Hugh; Baptiste, mercantilism reached its peak in the mid-17th century. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;degree of freedom:5 (urban-rural isolation)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The identity of the empire is divided into serfs, Farmers and citizens. The citizens are free people, while the peasants and serfs are not. This kind of system has provided the Empire with considerable stability, and it has received considerable praise among the citizens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aggression: 7 (active expansion)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion of the empire is quite To be obvious -- or to say that expansion may not be appropriate, because the only target of the empire is the South. The elf has signed a deliberation agreement, and there will be no fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of power (naval/land power): 9 (continental rights)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Imperial Emperor for the Navy I don't pay much attention to it, and I don't know much about sea power. All he cares about is his army. But this does not mean that he does not have a strong fleet, but the quality of the fleet is not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military establishment: 8 (mercenary and aristocratic, a few elite)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared with the population of the empire, the emperor's troops are not many, but the quality is quite good, and it is a few elites. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holy Coman Empire (North): gray and green areas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dorlan: DeLand, the capital. The first major port on the shore of Luxin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dil: The royal family directly accepts Diramon, which is equivalent to the status of Kinki. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;talantos: The royal family is directly under the jurisdiction of Taranto, the seat of the famous Catholic Conference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;newburg: A new large-scale bastion built in 1652, currently home to the Commander of the Southern Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;napo: Napo, the fourth largest port on the coast of the mainland. Now the home of the emperor of the dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parlunia: Palenia, the main route passed by the mainland railway in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goldharbor&mihr:Golden Port and Mill, the center of northeast trade, the second and fifth largest ports. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;santifigna: Sanitifegna, the famous capital of the Upper East Side Road, was conquered in 1453. The pressure has increased in recent years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ste: Invist, meaning "desert outpost." A city that stands in the middle of the big wasteland in the north, a paradise for adventurers. In the future, the main road passed by the mainland railway was renamed "Jinjing" after the control of the Far East. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Kingdom of the Holy Sepulchre: Green Area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;duchy f: The Principality of Figeta. The main cities are Figota (f, gloria and xenoland).<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;duchy soma: Soma Principality. Major cities have Soma (formerly the capital of the Near East Road, Somanasti, Soma) and Dagunya (dr.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;duchy noir: the Principality of Noor. Major cities have Noir, Tihr and the third largest port of Luxin in the northern twin islands (d.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;duchy sotaland: the Principality of Sotalan. The main cities are Sotaland, Tialun and Northend.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;duchyburg: Canny Principality. Former Canni Civilization The birthplace of the main cities are Fort Cannburg (burg) and Malto.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal Republic (overall)<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provinces<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;political composition: 9 (golden political bias)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Because of the inherent cost of democracy In the federal republics that pursue indirect democratic politics, all political acts are inseparable from the existence of money. This is a very obvious gold power politics, with no room for birth or bureaucracy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;centralization (central:6 (confederation)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is ironic that the Republic is more centralized than the Empire. The obligations of the republic to the central government are far more than the obligations of the Principality to the imperial emperor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;openness vative): 10 (innovative thinking)<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lonnie, the capital of the Federal Republic of the Congo, is the freest city in the world, and there is absolutely no doubt about it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;trade: 2 (free trade)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Republic does not interfere with any trade except for a small amount of tariffs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;degree of freedom:6 (free flow)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All citizens of the Republic have the same Rights and obligations - but there are still a large number of slaves, even comparable to the North. If you are not a citizen, there is no freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aggression: 5 (colonial expansion)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion of the province is mainly reflected On the New World, there was a fierce conflict of interest between the provinces and the elves and the north. On the Old World, the province is on a defensive posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of power (naval/land power): 5 (sea and sea balance)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is complete The sea power country Intre, so the land and sea rights of the province are basically balanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military establishment: 6 (volunteer military service plus mercenary)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Republic of the Union (South): Yellow toned area. The red line on the deployment map is the border before the fourth free war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entlave: Republic of Intre. The capital of Southpolis (southpolis). Important cities include Watergate, Redorlan, and Levilot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fatius: Republic of France. The capital of Pailo.

Including the capital Lonni (Loni) and the estuary fortress Fort Fortiburg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanson "The Elven Republic"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;holywood ”elven republic”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;political composition (politics): 3 (aristocratic bureaucratic political bias)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shengsen originally tried to distinguish the elves from the non-elf Implement a strict apartheid policy. This policy collapsed after the exploration of the era, followed by the "bloodline screening theory", only the "pure elves" can be reused, the "quasi-elf" (the smaller ancestry) is responsible for the middle-level position, and the "semi-elf" is the bottom layer. Jobs, not elves, cannot get high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Centralization (central:7(Federal)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanson’s centralized power is no longer comparable to that of the year Compared to the Elves of the Age of Elves, they still have strong central power. There are no modern architectures in the independent families of Sansen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Openness vative):7( Open)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shengsen was very occluded, but in 1453 Sanitti Fegna was opened a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trade: 5 (import and export quota plus trade embargo)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mercantilism It is very popular among the elves, and their unique platinum standard has added to this. The common saying goes, "Platinum goes west, there is no return." For the three main precious metals, it is basically a situation in which platinum goes west and silver goes east (because the Eastern Dynasty is the silver standard). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;degree of freedom:7 (free flow)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even non-elf, in Sanssen The interior can also enjoy complete freedom, independent of slaves or non-citizens. Because the system of class segregation is in name only, Shengsen can basically be regarded as a modern country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aggression:5 (colonial expansion)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint-Sen and Elves The entire South Xinjiang continent and the majority of the islands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of power (naval/land power): 3 (sea power)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanson on the road The strength is limited and the main force is at sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
