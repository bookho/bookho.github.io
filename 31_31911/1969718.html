			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Pre-announcement)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yellow Turban Taiping Road originated in the early days of the Eastern Empire, when Coman Shan Be part of the Elf Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This religion was strongly suppressed in its homeland, but one of its partial divisions broke the official magic user of the empire by virtue of its core personnel’s superiority in Taoism. - The encirclement network of the Confucianists set foot on the expedition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fall of the eight years of the Taiping calendar, the Imperial calendar of the Elven Empire (later standard calendar) 192 years, the first three years of the Eastern Empire, from the Eastern Empire After three years and more than a thousand miles of expeditions and battles, the Yellow Dome Army finally entered Gmesh, the later Qingniupolis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For them, this is tantamount to getting the center of the world, and getting the source of the peaches that the four great masters gave them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Western Passage of Taiping Road brought a new, unified religious ideology to the divided, historic Muleiman area. The concept that all things in the world are born out of an abstract, all-round omnipotence is undoubtedly a highly acceptable concept. It not only explains the suffering of the world, but also points out the direction of the world. All of the exclusive monotheistic religions we know today are affected by the peace of mind in one form or another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next two decades, those who were once enemies of each other were united under the flag of the Yellow-Taiwan taiji fish in Taiping. This emerging force will conquer half of the world with its army and completely change the other half with their minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-"New History of the Ancient World of DeLand", Dean University's Ancient History Compilation Committee, Volume IV, Chapter 7 "The Birth and Rise of Taiping Road" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend, Professor Boyer is an ectopic cultural scientist who has invested nearly 20 years since the fall of the Great Wall. The study of the plane culture. In a cocktail party in Xinjing, he talked with some scholars with status about his own research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In some planes, people believe that a mother is a virgin, and that a person without a biological father is a god. He died three days after he died. Forty days later, this man without a father came to the top of the mountain and ascended into the sky. Those outsiders believed that this was God's greatest miracle. His ability was to hear the thoughts of everyone in the world and to see everyone. Doing good or bad things and giving them rewards or punishments is still very effective after they die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the guests, a very famous The Taoist scholar at the Beijing University of the Far East heard an example of this alien religion commenting: “The reason why Wenhua is so interesting and so difficult is this. You have to explain why there are intelligent creatures who believe in such absurdity. The gibberish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Professor Boyer answered, the Taoist has changed to the next topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming the Taoist is a legitimate Taiping believer, he will believe the following series of statements:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right way created the universe, but until an Eastern uprising peasant leader preached it, it had no real power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To borrow the power of the right way, believers need to wear yellow textiles on their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right way cannot be expressed in words, but it can express its opinions through the warlords of the commanding army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right way wants the world to become an ideal world, but such a world is illiterate, but lives the life of primitive people and wears animal skins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a cultural scholar from another plane first came into contact with this belief system in Xinjing, I was curious as to what kind of evaluation he would make. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-"The illusion of Taiping - why theism is unnecessary", Professor of the University of the Congo, R.
