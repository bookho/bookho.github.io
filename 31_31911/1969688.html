Whether it is a direct attack or not, as long as you hear the never-ending hoof, even a brave soldier can't help but think of the horrible magical shelling. The rest of the sea of ​​stars followed behind Anne Sefer, shooting from time to time, dispelling all those who dared to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse walked through the blood and rushed out of the East Third District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two men rushed out from the shadow of the third city gate, the sky in the east had already appeared white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the door? Solerton's upper jaw clamped the horse's abdomen, hooked the toe with his toes, and pressed his hand on his gun. He looked up and glanced at the dawn that had just appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the reserve team, cut."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is heard by the woman of the horse The rider whispered, then he heard the gunshots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Block! For the Emperor's kneel, block!" The emperor was shouting hysterically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door pulls out the pistol, hooks the harness with the toes, and shoots sideways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time there are obstacles in front of them, there is probably a row. The enemies in the fourth zone are not so unorganized. Like the Freedom Army, the elite Emperor who invaded Lenny also tried to reorganize the army from the rout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is armed with a pair of guns, and when you smash all six bullets at the fastest speed, you begin to prepare your own magic. He didn't have the confidence to use aiming magic on horseback, or he chose automatic-guided magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He handed the gun to his left hand, his right hand draws the effect line in the air, whispering the curse: "Magic missile preparation... ah?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing happens, there is no feedback from magic. It's like being in the anti-magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is not reconciled, and sang a spell again, the result is still. He noticed that the enemy's magical officer was also anxiously squatting, seemingly wanting to use any magic, but could not use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't bother," the female knight smiled at the officer. "Your magic is useless."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is laying? I don't have to ask this question. Only one person can do this: Anne Sefer, the Lieutenant of the Freedom Army, defeated the backbone of the corps by one person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence is that dozens of magic arrows are emerging from the void around her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor’s official appearance changed dramatically, and the sword was pulled out in a panic, shaking the horse pointing to him and her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie even has no new spells, just hooked his fingers. The blue flash popped up from her arm, which was the ember of the sea of ​​stars. The strongest magician's wrist swayed and called out some hexagonal green floating magic shields to block the bullets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no suspense in the outcome of the battle. Her magic can defeat all the emperors on the main road, and there is nothing in this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is the most powerful magician he knows. She is the most powerful magician he has ever heard. She is the most powerful magician he can imagine. That overwhelming power and beauty can almost rule the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he still couldn't help but speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also want to use magic, Anne. What is the principle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie Ile The reins, stopped the horseshoe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire of the empire did not die, but while she stopped the horseshoe, they all fled, not only the body of the comrades They also dropped those injured companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, this is the magic net. How do you say this... It’s a bit complicated to say. Do you want to use magic now?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not now, think of the door. If he was the rational Liberal Army staff member last night, he should not ask this question. Now he should hurry every second, use Anne's powerful magic, seize the emperor, kill him, and then join her to become a hero to save the free country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the door still nodded lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. I want to know now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s now, seize this opportunity There is a voice saying to himself. Being controlled by the spirit of the person is enough, and he no longer wants to be controlled by others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only adaptability, experience and ambition are not enough. It is not enough that only the honors imposed on him by others. Far from enough. It was the Emperor of the Empire who told him that he was standing on a beach built by false luck and cleverness. The beach would collapse at any time, engulf him, and he would never die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annies turned her head and showed a light smile on her face, just as she had been waiting for this question for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me think about where I should start. For you, this should not be difficult to understand..." Her voice gradually decreased and almost became Whisper, "... Anyway, this was originally the idea of ​​the DeLand imperial school."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deland imperial school?" Namenton had a meal, nervously I searched for this name in my mind. "I have read the Journal of Imperial Olympics. They have classical schools, spiritual schools, and Dongyi schools. It seems that there is no..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, nothing, don't care. In the simplest terms, this is because I changed the rules of magic." Anne's tone is easy and freehand. "In the scope of the Lenny temporary magic net, the rules of using magic have been It’s not the same.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the door is big, and it won’t fit for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed the rules of magic! Can this kind of thing be done? Is this really human power? He simply wants to be impulsive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That...what is this rule?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as you learn the rules, everyone Can use the magic net." Annie replied, "This rule is very simple, we call it a 'handshake.' The magic net theory begins with a sentence: as long as three handshaking, we can change the whole world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three-way handshake?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The handshake is...what should I start from? Anyway, it is not What is too complicated technology, let me summarize it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I heard the words of Anne, there was an ominous premonition. A similar statement is usually found at the beginning of every paper that everyone can't understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first thing to say is the object of the 'handshake.' The so-called magic is the technique of changing reality with faith. The scholars of the Age of Elves think the power of this technology. The source is human beings, and modern experiments have negated this theory. The change of reality is a serious disobedience to the law, and the food you eat can produce far less power than magic can produce. According to DeLand The theory of the imperial school, the moment we use magic, actually abstracts the reality into two, one is the static reality of 'reality should be so', and the other is the dynamic reality of 'the target I want to change'. Dynamic reality interference The process of static reality is magic, and everyone's understanding of magic constitutes dynamic reality. The new world school, which advocates idealist philosophy, calls these two 'objective reality' and 'subjective reality', but in fact it is only some philosophy. The differences in the level, the specific experimental results have not changed much. The difference between dynamic reality and static reality is that the former is our magician The world's understanding, the latter is the world itself. The 'dynamic reality' theory was verified in Thomas's intervention experiment, and then the temporary magic net technology was completed under the auspices of the imperial school, which was used extensively in war. After the end of the war, the New World School completed the integration of the Magic Net, and the current Lenny Temporary Magic Net was built on the theory of the Magic Net. Modeling, renormalizing and modeling static and dynamic reality To create a magic net that is above the rough original dynamic reality. This magic net is the sum of the world views of all the intelligent creatures around. The magic net accommodates all thoughts, it is completely fictional, but only recognizes the facts. If you put everything in this world into this magic net, you can integrate objective reality with human knowledge, and integrate all the magic around you to reconstruct all the laws of casting. In order to establish this reality, the magic net will show you Make a request, you have to give it a response, and he will reward you with the knowledge and strength you expect, according to certain rules. Is the 'three-way handshake' understand me "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;.? & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"I don't understand. I don't understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie reached out and shook in front of his eyes: "You can see the magic net for the first time." Shake it. Respond to it, put forward your thoughts, it is the second handshake. Then it will return you, you can use magic. If you concentrate on meditation, can you see the blue lines that I control?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is raised, squinting, watching if there is If there is no blue silk thread. These lines float in the air, and if they are, they connect almost all the objects around them. These blue lines are very thin and thin like a spider's silk. You can't see it with a little relaxation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie went on to say: "Imagine accepting its request and using it to use your magic. If you are skilled, you don't need to make any gestures or spells. It's okay to use your own customary method of casting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try to grab the nearest blue thread, pose as usual, and read the spell: "Magic Missile!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing happens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie comforted: "That... try it with the experiential method? Re-think the feeling of your first use of magic. Concentrate and feel the changes around you. Feel the net and give yourself to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door gives up gestures and spells. He closed his eyes and began to think about his feelings when using the first magic. He concentrated and wanted to regain trust in his power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still no response. No matter how he concentrated, the blue giant net did not produce a trace of jitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it still not?" Anne, who has never taught someone else's magic, is holding her hair in an annoyance. "There is definitely no place for you to understand. The world is not just matter, It is the sum of the spirits. Everything you see is the sum of human understanding. Is it hard to understand? Ah, these definitions also need the support of the premise theory. Should we start from the epistemology... forget it, I Detach the steps of the magic net to demonstrate it once."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie reached out and grabbed a blue thread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first handshake. This network connects all the things that Lenny has magic, not even magic."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clenched her fists and the wires trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second handshake. What I want is to reproduce the sea of ​​stars. It knows how this magic should work, I just need to tell it again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blu-rays are beginning to emerge. That was the same process as last night, but now the door is more clearly seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light blue magic flows along the blue network and condenses into dew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dew condenses into water droplets, and the water droplets turn into smog. The smog gradually brightens like a star in the sky. The light and the afterglow of the Venus starred together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third handshake. The magic net will reward your efforts and efforts. The magic that magicians can call, and their own magic, and their The contribution made by Magic Net is directly related. Some people who don't contribute enough can pass the magic power of Magic Net, and even worse than his own magic potential. But this temporary magic net is built by me, its world is mine. The world, so all the magic above it can be controlled by me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue stars are gathered into a cluster of stars, and the stars gather in the moon, staying in Anne's break On the arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The name is 'the sea of ​​stars'. How can you understand it? With your talent for magic theory, you should understand it very quickly. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at Anne's confident eyes, Nanimen had to pretend to understand the nod. "Should... let me try." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The talent of magic theory? Who is she talking about? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First handshake... ah?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue silk thread leaked through his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. Give yourself to the magic net and admit his power. The first handshake...has it."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try again, the fingertips feel the general touch of the magic net electric shock. He felt it. That is the flow of magic. Is the key not a gesture or a spell? Just like the technique of silent hair? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is busy shaking his head, expelling this purely illusory touch from his mind, in case it is bad to develop bad habits. He reached out and tried to apply to the Magic Net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second handshake... magic arrow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fist clenched, but that blue The colored silk slid down from his palm. No magic flowed out. The door was getting more and more nervous. He took a deep breath and wanted to try it for the third time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, she and he both heard the tearing of the shells breaking through the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other and knew that it was not time to delay here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this magical action too big?" Annie turned her head and grabbed the reins. "Don't mention this problem first, we have to avoid it. Hold tight I, the door!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!" The door arm shook and slammed openly. "This...hold...hold..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female lieutenant in the red dress trembled, and the spurs on the right foot kicked heavily on the horse's flank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hold! The enemy artillery can detect my magic, they may also master the way the magic net works, we have to assault! Surface gravity (surface<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gravitation)!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...Newton's Magic?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of the door are drowned in the explosion of the magic-guided shells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Sea of ​​Stars" is a magic that is too eye-catching, not to mention that it is now the only large magic in the city at work. All the artillery that the empire can control is aimed at this street, ready to destroy the greatest threat with absolute brute force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door only hesitated, and hugged Annie’s waist tightly—because the horse had begun to step on the wall. Although the direction of gravity has changed, the huge acceleration caused by the moment of change is still likely to pull people out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised him was that the place where the finger touched was not the soft scent of soft jasmine, but the hard, cool glass-like crystal. Through the military uniform and the soft leather armor, he can also feel the hard hand and the flow of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is aware of this magic. Substituting organs, that is the magic that continues to be developed by the top mages of the dark ages. For top mages, extending life is an eternal problem. From the alternative prosthetic limbs, the replacement of organs to the backup of the body, a variety of magic techniques to prevent death have been completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magic of surrogate organs? You should go find a pastor, Anne!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horses Cross the vertical wall and climb the roof. The shells roared in houses and streets, making a deafening sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not a time!" Annie yelled and replied, "Where there is such a high pastor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Nothing we can find! How long can your magic maintain so many organs and prostheses!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need!" Anne was purely The left hand of magical energy flutters like a whip in the air, intercepting two other magical shells with tracking magic. "For the senior wizard, the body is just a consumable item!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He concentrated and stared at the surroundings. The blue lines quickly gathered and quickly separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of Anne’s body is also boiling, and these boiling magic affects the surrounding magic net, producing a beautiful abstract picture. The blue filaments are gathered into pigments and different grid shapes. From these grids, a wave of air masses are generated, some on the flight path of the shells, and some on the roof and roof. Between them constitutes the way forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie uses magic and does not need ritualized spells and gestures. She only needs to act, and the magic net follows her to get started. This scene is very beautiful in the eyes of the magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magic of her own and the magic of the magic net are ... resonating with the same rhythm? But how is this different from my approach?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes subconsciously, clinging to Anne's waist, feeling her magic, imagining the logic of these magical work. The surrogate organ itself is maintained by magic. It is connected with Anne's body by magic, and his fingers are involuntarily following the magic lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the beautiful waist is a bit uncomfortable, twisting and twisting on the narrow saddle: "Hey, itchy."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sound of the guns is still long, and the smoke and the wind cover her subtle voice. The only arm is holding the stable, the other hand is busy with colorful magic, there is no time to deal with the passengers behind. She is now a little regretful: when the primary leather is too close to the body...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, anyway, he will stop at the place... ...hey, I also sensed my magic flow! This, this talent is down, is it really low?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie held back a burst of laughter I continued to speak to myself with a voice that no one could hear. I marched forward and jumped over one street after another, avoiding a wave of shelling, until all the shelling stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that they have reached the enemy's front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, stop, we are here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie slammed the reins, Stop Malay and look out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door finally reacted to what he was doing. He was flushed and he let go of his hand, jumped out of the horse, and looked forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole city is burning, the yellow light of the flames and the blue light of the temporary magic net are intertwined. The houses on both sides of the road were torn down, forming a temporary bunker of criss-crossing; among these bunkers, the last reserve queue of the empire became the densest triple array, blocking her and his front, at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that there are warriors in the empire." Anne exclaimed, "Five thousand people... no, maybe 10,000 or 10,000 Five thousand people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was frowned and nervously made a force estimate. "If you don't consider the reserve team, seven to eight thousand. The last reserve team of the empire is probably here. Even if you use your magical frontal bombardment, I am afraid that it will not be able to penetrate this density. One or two magic missiles cannot be made. A soldier lost his combat power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The array of emperors was almost crowded, side by side, with muzzles attached to the muzzle. The opponent’s position on this scale obviously does not intend to be refilled, and all the battles will be won in the only one shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also have some shooters try to shoot them. Anne stretched out and screamed out three sets of protective magic for the defensive stray bullets. Thousands of pieces of porcelain floated in front of her, him and her horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gustav the Great is really a wise and decisive commander."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At the end of the lineup that stretched half of the fourth district, the golden man standing on the tower. His armor is engraved with the royal coat of arms of the Holy Coman Empire, and the "power" in his hand is clearly visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Want to rely on people to distract injuries? Then you don't need the sea of ​​stars." Anne stared at her for a long while, her lips twitched. "Can use magic." Have you gotten the door?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry to disappoint you. I am not a genius. I can't master such a complicated theory...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but all the words only condensed into one word: "Sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not in a hurry." Annie shrugged and turned over. "Let's divide the work. I'm going to kill the emperor, Soledon, you are responsible for the horse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Look...Look at the horse?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is suspected that he is wrong. She said the tone of "killing the emperor", just like saying "I am cooking this evening, you wash the dishes" so indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This horse has a lot of magic, and it is very troublesome to strengthen it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Anne looked at the dawn of the East and took a step. Just a few steps away, she suddenly remembered what it was like, and added a sentence: "And, when you go back to the road, you should sit in front of you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***-***-***-***-***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;August 9th, 1666 (mday +130) Dawn East Fourth District Empire Position<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***-***-***-***-***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop the shelling! The troops are in place!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop the shelling!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The command echoes above the reserve team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shelling stopped, and everyone took a breath. The all-out artillery was also unsuccessful, leaving only a few high-ranking mage two battles - the huge magical group is still there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy's magic is still working!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goal is still moving forward!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Medical Knights are already in place!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Guards Knights are already in place! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The largest intensive formation! Even if you fill it with people, fill it down here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The concentration of exclamation points in the dialogue between the emperors and officials is obviously more than ten times that of the weekdays. Headquarters has not made any plans for this situation, because no one can think of the elite caster group that the Empire is proud of, and it will fall into a situation of lack of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Build an enchantment! Reject the other's magical absorption!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Duke of the Duke! Reserve The magical power is not enough! Two-thirds of our magical power is against Lopez on the Northern Line. The rest of the people lost a lot in the previous battles and cannot guarantee basic magic support!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are afraid to abandon all the lower-level wizards, but the magic items seem to work fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let the logistics side Don't count the seized, any magic items are sent immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire consists of a mage, a priest and a nobleman since the first free war Although not listening to the command, it is not very orderly, but in the magic warfare, it has been steadily regulating the free army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to counter the difference in magical power of more than ten times, the southern countries have successively established military academies, public libraries, and manufacturing contractor systems, but they are only reluctant to The gap is pulled down to one-on-three; that is to say, "the caster who concentrates on the entire free country can achieve a temporary suppression advantage for the emperor on a partial battlefield." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Lenny’s offensive and defensive war is clearly not included here. Even after a few splits, the main legion's casters have only one-third left, and they have consistently maintained their magical advantage over the defenders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Witch of the Freedom Army suppressed all of them. It is suppressed to the extent that there are only a few dozen senior mages left in the entire legion, and this number is decreasing every minute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t mention the wide-area shelling magic that is enough to subvert some magical theories, and the erosive magic she uses makes every caster stunned. The blue line, which represents erosion, has spread so quickly that the level of danger has never been seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the blue line that is overwhelming like the net!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Senior Master rebuilds the formation for the center! Don't surrender to the Blue Line!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Measure magic flow, give me traffic data!”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The blue zone controlled by the enemy is expanding at a rapid rate! The flow is... is it... more than 5,000 units?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the opponent's erosion magic automatic? What is this metamorphosis spell!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy relies on the power of the new super magic! No need to be nervous, super magic Not terrible! Concentrate on defense, we can win!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the enemy will not give them more time. Everyone saw that the woman in the red uniform had jumped off the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Shusheng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on." Many people are suppressing fear and subconsciously repeating, "It’s finally here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deadly empire people squinted at each other and began a volley. If even the scattered formation and concealment can not fight against the sea of ​​stars, then only flesh and blood will be used to confront. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the huge magical group did not collapse as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, there is only one person marching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not a magical attack! Be careful that she uses a continuous transmission to break through! Don't mess around!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Responsible for commanding the first line of defense is the court mage Peter Riley, one of the few who can still use their own beliefs to use magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After discovering that the opponent’s magical power was beyond imagination, the imperial command system was quickly handed over to the army magician and pastor in accordance with the order. The remaining less than twenty high-level mages are each responsible for a line of defense, concentrating all magical weapons and anti-magic guns behind the flesh-and-blood defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tactics like "High-level Master One-Man Breakthrough" were originally the exclusive tactics of the Emperor, and the defense system against this tactic is still the first time today. Put into actual combat. The high-ranking mages led the sniper squad, hidden in the corners of the houses and streets, and watched the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Anne Sefer did not use continuous transmission. She felt that there was no need to do this extra calculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shooting! Shooting! Shooting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purple flying, the soldiers of the emperor The bullets that were fired smashed on a piece of ceramic piece. Probably the sinister taste of the caster, all the tiles are blue and white, blue and white, the best oriental goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blond female officer raised her left hand, which was purely magical, and painted a fascinating sketch in the air. Riley believes that he should be able to rank among the top 100 mages in the world, but even he can't see the magic of the tricks and speed. Whether it is remote or melee, whether it is sniper magic or range magic, no attack can threaten her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the commander, Riley can see, only the line of defense that has collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horror of the scene is difficult to describe in words, and it is a hundred times more powerful than the previous attack by the "Star of the Sea" attack. Every wounded person is subjected to a completely different magic attack, and their misery is different, like hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of such a scene, he eventually did not let his sniper squad launch an attack. He did not dare to give the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No... our assumptions are all wrong. She is not the kind of magician who relies on large magic. Light uses the skill and efficiency of ordinary magic, she is better than all of us. She uses large magic just because... ...just because... lazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of it, Riley began to tremble involuntarily. If you use that kind of big magic, it's lazy... What would it be like not being lazy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he saw Annie stop before the fifth line of defense and reached out to the line of defense. She said, "Do you still need me to repeat the previous things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The language seems to be magical. No, it must have magic, but the court mages can't recognize this magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, the entire line of defense is separated from the center. The most elite to the Imperial soldiers, became the wall of the "Sefir Corridor." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heroic imperial soldiers, like their comrades-in-arms, lost their will to fight in the face of this power beyond humanity. They silently put down the gun, stood silently, and watched the terrible witch pass by among them. Fighting such an enemy without any magical support is tantamount to sending death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some nobles couldn’t help but shed tears. They know that they will never forget the failure here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyry, who is also a court painter, couldn’t help but pull out his own sketchbook and drew this shocking scene on the sketchbook. Next to the sketch, Peter Riley wrote: "Magic is like a part of her body, and Lenny is like her world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At the end of the road, on the outer wall of Lenny, the commander of the Emperor of the Golden Chamber, the Minister of Military Affairs, the Duke of Figota, is also looking at this scene. The corridor stretched from where Anne was to the gate at his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the staff retreat, the opponent's combat power is far beyond the estimate. However, it has not exceeded the scope we can cope with."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to use that, Lord Duke?" Asked the staff, "The sacrifice..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;von?Fergo The Duke of the Tower replied: "It will not be worse than the first defensive zone. She wants to interrupt the backbone of our emperor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Please allow us to see the last. We are also very confident in the defense of that area and will not lose to her..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear the requests of the staff The scepter named "Power" in the hands of the Duke slammed on the ground: "No, you must leave. Your war is not over. This is an order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The old duke’s hand is holding the “power”, and the commanding sword at the waist is the “benevolent” of the Earl of the Eagle Wing. This means that he currently has command of all subjects of the empire. The staff did not dare to defy, and they left the top of the city wall after the military ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And I will see the last moment, otherwise I am sorry for the weapons that the Majesty and the Foreign Ministers have entrusted to me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke spoke to himself, looking at the thirty-four twenty-four-pound heavy guns deployed behind the line of defense. These heavy artillery used to attack the city have been filled with broken magic bullets and double shots, which is his last line of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the terrible witch is walking into the shooting zone of the last line of defense. Looking at her pace, the Duke finally passed through the plan in his heart, nodded with satisfaction, and put down the helmet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can separate the battle by the height of the magic, humans don't need magic."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Anne walked out of the last set of barricades, all 30 heavy artillery screamed, and the entire Lenny was shaken. Even the free bell on the top of the First District Council building swayed with the shelling sound and kept ringing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the smoke, the girl whispered the spell: "superelectromagic field"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her left arm, which is completely composed of magic, suddenly began to change. The electric spark flashed from the vicinity of the magic arm, and the magic arm itself made countless filaments, and it meshed all the bullets and broken magic bullets that were shot in front. The magician knew from a long time that he could use the magnetic field to deal with the bombardment of the iron sand weapon. He also knew that the magic can be used to deal with the magic metal. But until Faraday, they had a shield against electromagnetic fields common to all metals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the blonde lieutenant rushed out from the front of the rain - with a left arm made up of purely hot metal pellets and electric sparks! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her speed is so fast that the gunners have not had time to make a second load. Her left arm is like a demon of death, easily slaughtering the best artillery units of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at this tragedy, the face of the Duke of Fegota has not changed, but his eyes are slightly moist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You made the toughest decision for me." He slammed out the commanding sword "kindness" and ordered the road to "ignite the artillery position!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last two senior mages cast a high-temperature javelin consisting of pure flames at the artillery position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Induction of this sudden magic, Anne looked down and found that behind the artillery position, it was a mountain of wooden barrels. She also immediately realized what was in these barrels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obviously gunpowder. The emperor actually gave up their entire heavy artillery unit to be a bait! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one time to use a magic. She can't protect herself and get out of danger at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne bit his teeth and made a decision in an instant-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the gunpowder barrel of the entire artillery position It exploded. The Imperial Reserve team moved the gunpowder reserves of the entire regiment, with tens of thousands of pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a big bang that was enough to blow up half a street. The black smoke rose in the air and looked like a huge black mushroom. Except for the slowly falling cloud of smoke, the entire battlefield was silent, and people only heard the sound of debris, masonry, and metal particles falling on the ground and rolling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they noticed that the huge, star-shaped magical group seemed to be getting smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Win?" The emperors began to whisper each other, and the voice grew louder and bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know who first shouted: "Don't kill the witch! Long live the emperor! Long live the Holy Empire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This is a cheering ten, ten pass, until all the living people are starting to cheer. The wounded soldiers cheered with a faint voice, and the seriously wounded swallowed their last breath in a gratifying smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only two people did not join the cheering chorus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the western side of the battlefield, the young Freedom Army’s legs were soft and squatting underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...Impossible.Anne...Annie...I...I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Resistance? Soledon repeatedly repeated meaningless proverbs, fingers rubbing against the brick seams on the ground. His nails went down and the flesh was blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the eastern side of the battlefield, the chief commander of the emperor could not laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he heard a moving female voice, he was happily repeating the slogan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live the Emperor's majesty~?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old duke of von? Figota slammed At first, Anne Sefir, who was seeing a gray face, was slowly falling from midair, her face was full of smiles, and her right hand was placed on the forehead with a very non-standard empire to simplify the military ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The scepter is a 'power'... It's nice to meet you, the Emperor of the Empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes are wide open. Even if this arrangement... can't beat this witch? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A very exciting arrangement, squat, but it is enough. Our world needs peace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She landed not far from the Duke. The duke noticed that her military uniform trousers had been broken, and the black enchanted leather armor was embedded with shrapnel and bullets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
