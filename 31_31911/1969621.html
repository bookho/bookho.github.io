			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xviii<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fastest fleet of the Three Rivers Clippers "Wittsland" Unbelievable speed down the river. The southeast wind is blowing in the face, but the ship's cross-sail is full of wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ten minutes have arrived, change one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; replaced with red English Reese of the Trey Women's Military Uniform took a new staff from the box around her and replaced the power source of the sailboat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a whole box of “wandsylph” with a market price of at least tens of thousands of pounds, which consumes one every ten minutes, and is extravagant. A stunned usage. Of course, this level of speed is not something that ordinary sailors can control. Now, at the helm of the ship, the commander of the fleet, Kikawi himself - if the experience is not enough, it will directly hit the river bank at this speed of more than 18 knots. Or a reef. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't expect the ship to actually increase to this speed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even if it is Old sailors who have been sailing for more than a decade have now had to do their best to control the sails. It is no wonder that the “dream speed” of sailing ships that reached the 18th festival in history has been in the era of the popularity of steamships. In the current era, ships with a speed of ten to twelve knots can be called “the Clippers”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, thinking of such consumption and speed is actually to grab credit, Reese feels a little funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Creating a better world" sounds good, but when you are really down-to-earth, you can only use such a slightly less than bright means. As far as her position is concerned, it is only possible to support Clade to be the head of the Free Army, not Wiener, who has nothing to do with her; Betsy. As a woman, she can't do anything in this era. She can only choose the right agent and then control the operation of history behind her. Being able to participate in the scene of historical events as it is now, it is already very satisfying that Rex, who likes to be lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only problem now is that this military uniform is not very suitable..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breast It was a bit loose before, and the trousers were a bit long - to be exact, it was very close to "Batsus; only" Miss. Thinking of this, she glanced at the person who found the military uniform not far away, and felt a little unreasonable. Tedwood's corrections were on the side of the ship, facing the beautiful scenery of the Matterby River, and all the foods that had been eaten at the previous dinner were vomited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The chief staff of the southwestern army, the hero of the Lenny defending war, is actually a seasickness. It’s really pitiful... In the future, he won’t be afraid to sit in the future. Did the ship not follow the Freedom Force's main force to evacuate Lenny? This is a very interesting interpretation of the wild..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She licked her lips, revealing a naughty smile I decided to go to the unfortunate Lieutenant Colonel. Although there is not enough symptomatic magic on hand, there is still one that is barely symptomatic. The true meaning of magic is to learn and use it. This is what the "person" taught her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Tedwood, are you seasick? I have a spell here, maybe I can ease it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hur raised his head like a life-saving straw. Reese read a few words that no one had heard, and added that magic to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This should be a little better. Speaking, you lend us the uniform of Miss Wei, is the size too special? It is very loose. Ah."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This, this..." Helter yawned and yawned, his face clearly accused "In fact, I didn't borrow at all." I am going to wear it for you, but I dare not say it clearly. "Because there is only one female officer in Lenny today, I ran and borrowed it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Really? I think the size of this dress is very familiar... I didn't expect you to have the talent of a tailor, Mr. Lieutenant Colonel." Reese smiled and ironically, "In fact, our only lady is I realized that the size of this military uniform was too fit, and decided to send me with these wind elements. In fact, you wanted to hide these military uniforms in your own wardrobe as a collectible, right?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hull stepped back two steps, his face: "Hey, what are you talking about? This size is purely coincidental. For distinguished Balu Si; Ms. Wei absolutely no unnatural "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"Really?!" Hearing this sentence, Hull suddenly cheered up and scared Reese. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...really." Anyway, this character will not be played by me anymore, so the blond girl who is thinking about it, "Yes, you Don't you feel tired? The magic that deals with seasickness should be a little sleepy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said this, it’s really a bit." Hull hit again. I yawned, "No, I have to take a break below."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, because the magic book is 'tiredness'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reese thought in her heart and asked the last question. "Right, Miss Just asked me to ask you if you can prepare for her several Free Army officers. Location? She may use it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hull’s head is immersed in the "hope" and "tiredness" effects, without hesitation Patted the chest: "No problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that he staggered and disappeared into the cabin, Reese sighed and picked up another Of Staff. "Make it. Men are really fools. Why can't you be honest? Speaking, this identity is really easy to use, and you have to tell Bonnie to go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Of course, if Bonnie knows what his sister has done with this identity in an unscrupulous manner, the face will turn into iron blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hours later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ega; Eugen stood at the top of the wreckage of the Second Fort, looking at the fire in the south, and igniting another cigar impatiently. Quitting smoking has obviously failed completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The difficulty of such a firebird contest is a bit more difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir Now is not the time to laugh! Your intestines are coming out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, it seems to be. Fortunately, I am a licensed pastor." The school looked down and saw the intestines back to the abdomen, and used a "medium treatment" to fill the wound. "It's a pity that this soft leather armor took a lot of effort to get it from the supply department." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a blessing to be swept by a stun gun. Is it a monster?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing him so calm, the surrounding soldiers were whispering in surprise, seemingly diluting some of the bleak atmosphere of three previous forced assaults. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eugen used this corner of his eye to get to this situation, with a little peace of mind, the wound in the abdomen seemed to be less painful. It’s not really painless, it’s not really nothing to do – but as a chief staff officer, he must behave like this. If the morale is now smashed, then everything is really over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artillery...they are erected on the edge of the southern line of defense, close at hand, but far like the horizon. Although the troops retreated from the third defender that had been destroyed to the second guard, the situation did not improve. This hexagonal bastion, which can be covered with more than a dozen artillery pieces, is too small for a force of nearly 5,000 people, including a large number of wounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of three assaults, all failed, but only a total of more than 400 bodies, including five support, were dropped in front of the artillery. The caster is inside. The last time, he personally pressed and directed two grenadiers to try to blast the other's artillery positions, and was also hit by the volley of guns and cannons. The rows of volleyed shells formed a dead line between two hundred and fifty meters to one hundred meters. In the case that both sides have enough magical support, the old warfare method that uses several magician leaders to forcibly break through is not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The siege was slamming, and two hundred pounds of lead were smashed at the top of the bastion, showing a huge pit. He shouted loudly and directed the remaining pastors to treat the wounded. The wounded are far more than the body, the healing potion is running out, and the magical scepter is also, the gems that store the magic are no longer shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you ignore casualties, you should still be able to break through. After all, the other infantry strength is less than ours..." Eugen gently pressed the waist with his hand The pistol, hesitating, "...but it is not necessary. Although I am not Robert; the extreme moralist like Ayr, but I used the front attack method, I will not lose to the Fagas?" They are not a way to blast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allow retreat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allow retreat?" The guards of the fortress and the attacking fortress simultaneously read the message, which is a glimpse. “How and where to retreat?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eugen and Robert started thinking about this issue almost simultaneously. Eugen had no cavalry on hand, and he couldn’t escape the pursuit of guerrilla cavalry. Nearly five kilometers to the forests in the north, the infantry of the marching speed has to walk for more than 40 minutes, during which time it can only be slaughtered by the guerrilla cavalry pistols and sabers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you only take the elite troops to retreat, it will be different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave the wounded, and the troops that are enough to guard the wounded! Place them in the depths of the bunker! The rest of the people, come with me!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This action was discovered almost immediately by Robert's reconnaissance force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rebels have withdrawn from the North Gate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Army A burst of horror, do not believe that the opponent actually made such a foolish. As the commander of the guerrilla cavalry, Pope Major, was passionately prepared to pursue, the cautious Robert stopped him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible. If you go south, the only way is to avoid the defensive range of the artillery position, detour the first guard, and quickly break through there, go The West Gate of Fort Worth. This must be the strategy of the East, and the other side will use the fortress guards to attack our artillery positions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After making such a judgment, Robert immediately ordered the main artillery position to move westward, allowing all his cavalry and half of the infantry to be launched. The sound of the gun that lasted for two hours gradually fell. Whether it is Weibao, the main plug or the siege, they are busy preparing their own actions. After a quarter of an hour, the decisive intelligence finally came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fortress garrison has really attacked from Simon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking into the distance Lieutenant Colonel Ayr turned to the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We must first defeat the enemy forces who dare to take the initiative to attack, and then defeat the enemy forces that they want to withdraw. Let their coordinated operations become a single blow." The farce... Justice is with us! We will end this war with minimal sacrifice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His orders are communicated through the various magicians Go on. The guerrilla cavalry began to run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artillery on Fort Vatican roared, and the continuous bombardment sounded far and near. Although the enemy has not yet been seen, the bombardment of the friendly forces is enough to allow the door; Sorelton knows the enemy and their relative position. Like the commanders of the other seven company, he ordered his assault company to keep the formation slowly retreating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This enemies have more than a thousand people, led by Major Constance. Gowar gave his order concisely: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the other party sends the main force to chase the troops of Lieutenant Colonel Eugen, you will put the other's artillery positions off. If the other party’s main force kills you, try to reduce the loss and then withdraw the fortress. Robert, Ayre’s excellent commander will take the initiative. Then we use the fortress’s artillery and buildings to destroy it in the fortress. Their main force."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the order is "destroying the enemy", but wanting to really "defect", it is also necessary to ensure that the life is withdrawn. . Everyone has such an idea, so they dare not ignore it when they are in the array. The array is like a giant monster moving slowly backwards against the tortuous walls, but the other party's arrival is much faster than their retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they are all infantry, the other side is a cavalry. On the battlefield, the infantry is weak and the cavalry is strong. The infantry had only one rifle and a short bayonet, and each of the dragon cavalry had four pistols and a shiny, saddle-reinforced sword. The weight of the cavalry with the horse is four and a half times that of the poorly employed infantry. Now, the pure force of light is calculated, and the French people are twice as much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The parallel array of troops, put the shield!" The gendarmerie captain did not hesitate to order, and decided to stop the other party's first assault. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many dozens of shields in accordance with the classical procedures of the hundreds of years ago, in the direction of the guerrilla cavalry in the direction of the next row of tower shield. Most of these old empire-era tower shields have a history of more than two hundred years. They are made of fine oak and are re-warmed with a layer of bullet-proof magic for the new era. Although it is not enough to resist the rifle, it is barely enough to withstand the dragon cavalry's pistol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lieutenant Soleilton, with your assault on the flanks ready to block!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; receiving this order, Namimen glanced at the enemy. Obviously, the other party saw the shield, stopped and re-adjusted the force. That was the decision that any commander like Robert would like to take. In other words, the other party can only return to the flank attack - it will become the front line soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the bayonet all right? Everyone? One step and a half, let the commando with magic equipment in the front row, the rifle with the bayonet In the first row, in the second and fourth rows without bayonets, the heavy-duty smoothing gunners are in the third row -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young lieutenant with a little reluctance Returning to his own army, try to release the front line like a real commander, but the calf is shaking slightly. This is the real battle, life and death hanging in the front line of the battle. Maybe with a knife or a shot, his life will end here. This is completely different from his previous paperwork. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These basic rules don't need you to say, Sorrenton sir! Just tell us which line should be armed?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A platoon leader smiled and prevented him from reciting the cumbersome rules. The veterans’ faces were casually smiling, and seemed to be unconcerned with the hard battles before them. Most of them came back from the Rusher army with Govar and survived the coup night, and they were already numb to the dangerous situation. The bitter smile caught the door, and he solved the heavy heavy-slung rifle from his back. He took two steps and stood in the queue, standing in the middle of the entire defensive position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He placed the cast iron bracket underground, and propped up the handle instead of a gun, rather than a large iron tube of the miniature gun, the voice of the order was also loud. stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The flank is forty-five degrees inclined to the shield, leaving room for retreat and strain! If the other party keeps the distance, use the cover of the bastion and fight back And..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused and looked at the commander of the secret silver armor. The scene before Robert crossed the entire shooting line seemed to reappear in front of the teenager. Always standing at the forefront of the team, cherishing the soldiers is like a commander who loves his own hands and feet. Even if it is an enemy, the command style of that person is really heartbreaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...maybe nonsense, but we are not specifically going to die. If you can't hold it, you can escape and live."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was trying to keep going, a heavy hand fell on his shoulder. The boy jerked back and saw Constance's expressionless face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is normal, your order will go to the military court, Lieutenant Soledon. But considering that we are carrying out the most dangerous enemies, I won't record it this time." The gendarmerie captain rarely squeezed a bitter smile. "I believe in your ability and do your best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, me Will try their best." Hearing this sentence, Nana felt a warmth. This friendly major, he saw it for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful, they have to rush over. Stare at your people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow the major Looking in the direction, he saw Robert; Ay pulled out the sword. It was a sword with no decoration, as the chief staff officer, too shabby ordinary steel sword - no, it is better to say iron bars. Even in the face of a thick lineup of bayonet seas and heavy guns that lie in front of the cliffs, the lieutenant colonel with iron bars did not hesitate to stand at the forefront of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A guy who was born in the wrong age. The charge is the last freak of the team, he is the last one."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen heard the cold voice of his gendarmerie captain. Constance and his men formed the main force of the fourth and fifth rows. He had two long pipeline pistols and two double-barreled pistols attached to his waist. He had an overweight musket with a mantra engraved in his hand. Robert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time he said this, the plain steel sword waved. Several masters with the six-star-struck symbol on their arms immediately took out some kind of magical props from their arms and began to recite the curse--the shallow red light shrouded the entire cavalry lineup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mounts of all the cavalry suddenly stopped moving, and they fell down on their high necks, seemingly no longer afraid of the shelling around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first row of cavalry rushed across the shooting line! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They want to rush! Shoot the guns!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is subconsciously shouting But the speed at which the flint and the turbine collide is much faster than the speed of sound that he commands to spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Freedom Army’s regulations, the shooting line for the slippery gun is eighty yards. For the running horse, this distance can only be reached in eight seconds. One pound of lead can be cast into twenty-five rounds of bullets, and the front of the first and second rows has a total of four hundred people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, in these eight seconds, two rows of soldiers serving as bayonet lines need to pour 16 pounds of lead in eight seconds, then squat down The bayonet was inserted into the barrel and gave the shooting line to the rear row of muskets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed a brave technical job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scattered black smoke swells up against the moonlight, the entire row of muzzles rises, and the sound of the blast hitting the cast iron barrel one slice. Seven or eight cavalrymen fell from the horse immediately, and more than 20 horses fell down; but the rest of the people just did not hesitate to take a reins and leaped from the end of the people, the speed of the overall charge did not change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slipper Shooting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One pound lead can be cast into twenty-five hairpins A bullet is fired, but it can only be cast into ten heavy-weight rifle bullets. The power of the third row of muskets to fire is far from the first two rows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first running horse touched the blade of the first row of bayonets, sixteen pounds of lead poured toward them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge lead shot that was almost zero-range shot, the riders fell to the ground with their horses. Among them, there is a special enchanted bullet that draws a yellow-green light in the air and directs to their coach! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...repulse shield!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert; Ayr seems to have Prepare to slam the reins, and the right hand draws a light blue horizontal line in the air, welcoming the yellow-green trajectory. The powerful magic of this guardian domain is stopped on the action line of the enchanted bomb; the light blue and yellow-green magic light bursts open when the first row of short soldiers meets, and the magic inside the enchanted bomb expands along the repulsion shield to the left and right. Made a dazzling white glare! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was staring at everything that happened in the eight seconds - at this point, he didn't even pull the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is now, grab your guns and retreat to the shield wall!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kang Stan shouted. I don't know when the shield team that was originally in the north returned to them. Like the other muskets, the door-to-door grabs the musket that has not yet been fired and rushes toward the back of the shield. At this moment, the cavalry who had been blinded by white light bumped blindly on the bayonet of the first two rows of soldiers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are countless voices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of bayonet and saber stabbing, the sound of sharp edges passing through armor, the sound of weapons landing, percussion-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Then there is a short scream, an angry scream, and a slap in the horseshoe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two rows were shot by lead shots, the third row was pierced by bayonet, the fourth row of bodies was stacked on them, and the fifth row was rolled on the ground. The sixth row hits the shield of the tower shield -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the opponent has only six consecutive cavalry, or the bayonet line is not only two rows, then it should Score the winner. However, the current situation is not the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth row of cavalry rushed past the line of defense. They all followed the red light from the chief's waist staff -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron bars that can’t see the magical light, can easily be cut off continuously The tower shield with magic on all sides, leading the cavalry without stopping -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- More quickly than the description. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As several soldiers fled, more and more people fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle was broken and broke through mercilessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people die every second, and blood flows along the front of the square. It is the same as the previous situation, but the difference in the number of rows determines the difference in results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first row of assaults to the front takes eight seconds -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- and the tenth row The sabre was only two minutes later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lineup of the soldiers was disordered, their will collapsed, and the people who wanted to survive fled to the fortress. They crowded the suspension bridges, trampled each other and fell into the water. Even by magic, by bayonet, by tower shield or by heavy rifle, all resistance is ridiculous in front of the crazy running horse and saber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of the cavalry with the squatting stopped the Malay and looked at the scene. The door of Fort Fort is wide open! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Break into the castle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert did not hesitate and gave orders. Even if there are 5,000 undefended enemies behind him, even if he realizes that it may be a trap in front of him, he does not hesitate. No matter how much risk he takes, he will not let go of the opportunity. This is related to whether the entire Faculty faction can master the Free Army. However, even so, he did not forget to shout loudly at the other soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can lay down your arms, or you can retreat! As long as you put down your weapons, I guarantee your safety!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The 1,800 cavalry who had not been wounded bypassed the shovel and the ditch, jumped over the suspension bridge, stepped on the body and the man who was about to become a corpse, and entered Fort Buddha in the splash of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last alarm bell rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a defeat at all, but a real defeat... forget it, so that Robert will not withdraw. If Constance is lucky Is there still about three hundred people left? He is a good gendarmerie captain, but unfortunately not suitable as a commander."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing such an ending Govard sighed and shook his head in shame. He has no choice. Since the advent of the artillery, the force is no longer the only consideration for the outcome of the battle - it is as if the muscle strength is no longer the only difference between the strength and the strength after the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Captain Itis, trouble you to signal to Eugen and Cousin. The content is 'all goes well, follow the plan'."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this indifferent command, Isis was stunned and asked, subconsciously, "I can say that everything is going well, sir? Constance’s troops are almost no Existed, the enemy also rushed into the fortress without any blockade..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gowar gently shook his head and asked: "You think the basics of war What is the principle, Captain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be a concentrated strength." The captain replied without hesitation, "One thousand people and one thousand people can only die together." However, there will be 1,500 people left after the troops of two thousand people have destroyed a thousand troops."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are the forces we are now focusing on?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the hands of Eugen and Cousin...but we give Constance and Soledon them..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marshal put his hand on his chest and lowered his head silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is no way. Commanders who are weakened to concentrate their forces must work hard to survive. In the war 20 years ago, Even the troops that carry out the escort mission are completely destroyed, let alone the troops that carry out such dangerous missions as the enemy... This is the price necessary for victory. Send a message, madam."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis also shook his head bitterly, sending two pale yellow beams to the northwestern wilderness and the northeastern sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
