The dragon's treasure is usually a huge accumulation of hundreds or even thousands of years. Medieval peasants and bards It is generally believed that the property of the dragon exceeds the richest prince. In the Eastern Empire, people used the term 'surgery of dragons' to refer to the use of power and force to capture the knowledge of the world, implying the assumption that 'the dragon's property can be compared with the whole world'. If you accept this number..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the magic net uses the voice of Anne Seifer to say a number with a wide range of fluctuations. Even the lowermost side is a number that is enough to hold your breath, enough to build two new freelancers from scratch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half a mile, Major of the Port of Hong Kong, Major General Nate Soleton, took a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy wheezing echoed through his own skull in his ear, as if he could hear the hooves of galloping in the blood vessels in his brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of nervousness, his throat is a little dry. The left eye enters the magical field of vision uncontrollably, and the cause of his tension is in the field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this vision, he can see the two beautiful ladies around him – and the great magical group that surrounds them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you look closely, the magic group is composed of countless magic net force field lines, these lines are intertwined, forming an illusory, as if the top The satin-like structure exudes a dazzling magical light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman standing opposite him with a silver-waisted silver hair and a proud figure, the real identity is a dragon with a silver wingspan, standing on the sacred Coman One of the guardians of the Shuanglong at the top of the sacred contract of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her skin is almost white, with silvery scales, and a breathtaking beauty that makes his vision almost impossible to remove from above. The silver dragon's daughter's fingers are slender, with some scary dark purple long nails. The door is known to be a certain deformation of the dragon's claw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door did not see the silver dragon girl at such a close distance. He once saw her silver dragon form on the battlefield of Jena Blenheim's double battle, which left him with unforgettable memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you invest millions of taxes, you can only suppress the "slayer dragon melody" made by almost all the high-level magic industry experts in the South. This silver dragon is just a daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no Protestant Archbishop Bonnie Sefer, who is the first of the Protestantism, she will be able to suppress all the heights of the audience. Segment caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You tell me directly. If I intend to invest in your small business, how much can I give back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong asked, looking straight at the young priestess who had stopped her with the two most powerful compound spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop Bonnie Sefer hesitated, slightly sideways and asked his neighbors with his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intuition makes the young majors cross Bonnie and stand up to face the daughter of Silver Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Archbishop of Sefer has asked these specific secular questions. If you want to invest, just look for me, we always welcome independent investment. People...hey, of course, welcome to invest in His Royal Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the situation has changed dramatically. The arrival of Bonnie and the formation of the reinforcements were all on the original schedule. The success or failure was the most important financial plan affecting the future of the Hong Kong military regime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the appearance of Silver Dragon makes this all very different. She holds so much wealth, can control such huge money and situation, whether she can smoothly pull her into the camp will determine the success or failure of the entire plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was originally a combat exercise to boost morale, but now it has suddenly become an important battle that can determine the outcome of a war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things he learned as a staff member in the Freedom Army was that the battle could not be avoided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A war can be avoided, a battle can be done, but only the battle can not. The reason why a battle broke out is because the two armies are there - and sooner or later, there will be a result, no matter what the victory or defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a sense, this Miss Silver Dragon can even count as an enemy. Obviously, she was invited by another guest who was barely a friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh. You are the one Sorenton? The full name is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong There was a crack in the noble and cold expression. She clearly recognizes the endurance of the door - in terms of the general attitude of the dragon to humans, this memory is already very unusual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Major Neremon Soleden. Is the publisher of this small business."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The door is trying to make your voice sound funny, but the words are very dry. In contrast, the opposite woman of the Silver Dragon has a face, but the words are not so serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can call me Mara. According to your human etiquette, you should shake hands now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Mara stretched out the innocent and slender right hand forward. Yinlong did not wear heavy armor, but only symbolically put a close-fitting tight-fitting silver scales, and the jade arms that were turned into human beings were all exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is reaching out and can’t help but think: I don’t know how much of this beautiful body and costume is real, and how much is magic. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite hand touches the touch of human skin, but it feels cold and almost does not feel body temperature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maralo lowered his gaze and looked at the young officers in front of him from head to toe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey. I thought it would be a beautiful young man in Yushu, or a domineering young hero. In the male humans I have seen, it seems to be slightly ordinary. A little bit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong smiled slightly, and the smile made people feel chilly. Her fingertips—or, the knuckles of the dragon's claws, glided across the palm of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the male humans I know, such as Arthur Coman, the standard may be a bit high."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was chilled. He suddenly remembered that the silver dragon lady in front of him was not only the reinforcement of the first princess of Olia Hugh Coleman, but also his friend of the childhood friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do she think of this matter? Nana is a little afraid to imagine the answer to this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, I am very glad to meet you. According to your etiquette, it should be this~~~~~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Silver Dragon said with ease, the right hand nails in the palm of the door, a little effort, the two sharp nails like a knife edge easily pierced his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indescribable pain rushed into the mind of the major, and the blood ran down from the fingers, and he regained his hand in a reflexive manner. Resist the door with his tongue against the upper jaw, avoiding your own voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the dragon does not need to shake hands as a "no weapons and hostility" etiquette is justified: the dragon claw itself is a deadly weapon of incomparably sharp. During this movement of his hand, Mara's slender nails passed through the back of his hand, leaving two scary scars of blood and flesh. If she squeezes a little bit hard, I am afraid that his palm has been cut in half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it seems to be very angry about this thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like...I know that when both sisters are deceived by the same person, the elder sister who is rushing to settle accounts? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teeth of the door knocked together and bit the sound tightly Screaming. If you don't let anyone notice the anomaly here, then there is still a chance, he thinks so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But someone has already noticed: a person who has been watching him all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the blood has not yet fallen to the ground, the archbishop Bonnie Sefer changed a little, taking a small step forward, the right hand A little glimpse of the action that people can't detect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highly concentrated therapeutic light ball is thrown along the throwing line of the right hand, accurately throwing the finger between the right hand of the door, instantly bridging the wound there - Although it does not heal the pain signal on the nerves, it can stop bleeding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mara’s look is dignified. She understood the horror of this reaction, observation, and combat power. The silver dragon quickly pulled back his hand and pressed a few hairs that had been slightly erected because of the warning. That should have been the position of the dragon crown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Investing in His Royal Highness, is your courtesy too intense?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where, I have always been famous in the dragon class with proficiency in human etiquette. Although it is a small circle, it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One person and one dragon is once again arrogant, as if it will be again Go to war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door slammed the right hand, still very painful, and hurriedly stopped between the two, deliberately raising the voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since... the cold has passed, then please invest in the Dragon Dragon, how much money do you plan to invest in this small business?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door intentionally sealed the route of both sides. Since the silver dragon lady in front of me was invited by Olivia... it should not be too hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used the corner of his eye to squat to the place where the imperial princess stood. Unsurprisingly, Olia's lips are opening and closing quickly, talking to people through magic that is invisible to the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, okay." Mara shook her head gently and refocused her eyes on the young man in front of him. "Investment amount... um, That's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silver Dragon lowered the voice and said a number, its unit is pounds of gold - not gold pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the number, even Bonnie Sefer from later generations stunned. Her eyes turned a few turns, and she made quick calculations in her mind, then held her breath and took a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This number also makes the door grow up, and can't close it for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This has exceeded the limit number you provided, Anne?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only You can search for the corresponding research of the world historians. Besides, the empire's Zhenguo Yinlong is definitely much better than the average dragon. If you have doubts about the statistics, you can find help in the Encyclopedia: Statistics item. Need detailed post-statistics items?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...Thank you for the time being, thank you. If you have a dragon entry, please be strong, noble, proud. Add a 'irresponsible' suffix to the trustworthy letter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the number provided by Anne was enough to arm two freelancers, then Yinlong The number that Mara personally said should be able to re-arm the entire Free Army and Navy, and then support the military squad they have for a year and a half. How long can it be supported? It is not the poor ability of the mouth to calculate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Metty! Metty! Accept my communication!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So large numbers It’s not that the door is dare to agree. He hurriedly contacted Metty, who was straightening his neck and looking at the bustle, and threw the amount provided by Mara through the magic of communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metty passed the news to her accountant and Zhang Shiyi on the side. Zhang’s sergeant whispered to the Oriental adviser who was wearing a wide-breasted sleeve and holding strange feathers. Everyone’s face carries a look of “This is a joke.” General Fisher, the finance director of the Seventh Fleet, also heard this number, but did not join the discussion, but nodded in the direction of the door with a serious expression, making people unable to understand his intentions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How? Can your small business bring a reasonable return on my investment? I don't need a significant return."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mara has a deep smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons are too lazy to lie, they are usually too lazy to hide their intentions: "This dragon is to use a huge number to make it difficult for you, this bastard" The words are almost written on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, I still want a few basic investor security terms. Don't whisper on your side, listen together!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mara half-side, pointing away from the crowd closest to the pier. Out of the conditioned reflex, people except the imperial family and Zhang Shiyi have stepped back half a step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First of all, I will not be an enemy of the empire. It is the Coleman royal family that signed the contract with me. I am afraid that I will not receive anything." The effect, I hope you will not do anything more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door clearly sees some of the guests' faces are not very good-looking. The speech of Yinlong is almost a demonstration of the empire - not so much as she is investing, it is better to say that she is adding chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the main colonies of the Coman Empire are in Beixinzhou, there is no power on the most profitable Eastern route, but this does not mean that the Empire has no threat to the channel. The 100,000 emperors gathered by the Emperor of Light in Lenni are a big threat: as long as a few thousand people are enough to capture the majority of Interlake's ports with the help of a powerful navy - as is the case today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People can’t help but wonder if the emergence of Silver Dragon will symbolize the empire’s continued efforts to maintain its presence in the South Sea? Mara smirked and said the second condition, as if to prove their conjecture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, if you want to use or transfer this money, you should get my permission in advance. I don't want to let the savings of thousands of years go through the night." I believe that even if you have an army, you can't stand the revenge of the dragon for you personally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is of course. We will definitely guarantee your funds. "Safe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is used to deal with the official article, and I look at Olia bitterly. What I think in my mind is the implied in the silver dragon. Threat. That means of course "I can make a surprise attack on your weaknesses whenever necessary." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial princess seems to have been staring at him before. Seeing the sight of the door, Olia looked up in a panic and looked at the sky, using the mouth shape to spell out the sentence "I am sorry, I will talk to her again." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Princess’s Royal Highness represents the official attitude of the Empire: it is not allowed to completely control the sea power in the hands of any major enemy, whether they are The elf is still a free rebel. The offensive and defensive empire in the southern waters did not invest too much resources, only to support those separatist forces and the royalists to capture several ports around Interry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless this is her strategy - this thought flashed through in the mind of Naimen, making him shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a silver dragon resident in the Interlaken, you can monitor the situation on both sides of the sea - even if this is not the best usage of the dragon, it is quite Outstanding plan. For those weak Port Guards and Marines, the one-stop dragon can really change the whole situation...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also immersed in such staff-like thinking, but resistant The door did not ignore the last request from Yinlong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Finally, I want to retain access to this money at all times. Every dragon should have basic dragon rights, such as rolling on shiny things. And so. How can these conditions be accepted?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This slightly humorous condition made the door hesitate and looked at the girls. The conclusions reached by his collaborators are obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most people's opinions are "opposition." From the point of view of the staff, it seems that there is no benefit to having a silver dragon that is clearly loyal to the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the part of Naimen’s mind as a commander is screaming – like he is in Fort Fort, Stilburg, Jena and When Lenny was on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important ability as a staff member is to speculate on what the enemy wants, to analyze what the enemy can do; and to know what the army wants. What is it, to understand what our army can do. The most important ability as a commander is knowing when to apply this knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is a battle, Silver Dragon Mara has always had an absolute advantage; but when she heard her last request, Nana felt himself Vaguely saw some kind of turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it true that the goal of sending a silver dragon, or the traitor who came here, is different from Silver Dragon Mara’s own goal? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his eyes to Bonnie Sefer, who stood almost side by side with himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it were me, I would leave my Highness Mara and her money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp A letter of communication sounded in his ear, with the advice of the young Archbishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think so too, Miss Bonnie?" He replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because it seems to be more interesting." The information sent by the Archbishop, who has always been very serious, is rarely with a relaxed feeling. At this time, the door was aware that this person was indeed the sister of Anne Seifer who was always surrounded by a pleasant atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter reinforces his determination. After pretending to contemplate for a moment, he looked up and stared at the silver-plated pupils with their brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is indeed a very reasonable request." The door nodded. "Just, we may have some difficulties in implementation. I want to ask." Investing in the Dragon Hall, you have a small question about how you can withdraw your return."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mara put away a smile: "Let's talk."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It may be that I am ignorant, but I have never heard of what the dragons have bought with money. We have tried to contact your family many times, but they have all been It’s time to refuse, right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We don’t buy anything at all, just don’t have much to use money. Even in human form, As long as you open to humans, the general problem can be solved immediately, and you don't need to spend money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong Tairan utterly speaks of a similarity in the Eastern Empire The emperor "If you don't have food, why don't you eat meat porridge?" Naimen seemed to hear someone gently "cut", but he did not hear who it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is to say, if you are a shareholder, you should not accept a form of return like goods, notes of value or privileged shares. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me a monetization, realize it!" Maraldo said a little impatiently, "Please change all the shiny currency - the gems can also I don't need magic items or rare materials either."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door-end is frowning as a difficult brow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am curious. Since you don't have the need to spend money, you don't need magic items, props, materials or anything, then what is the use of collecting money and gems? "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In our opinion, it is strange to collect gold and precious stones for the sake of spending money." Mara’s tone screamed, "just like You humans love to collect all sorts of strange things. What our dragons love is these gold and jewels themselves! You actually have to take these beautiful artworks and spend them. It’s really unknown! Look at those Gold coins and accessories of different ages! How wonderful it is to rub the scales with them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I don't have long scales." Said with a bitter smile, "But it is very difficult for us to do this. Our small business needs to actually use the money -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Silver Dragon has begun to become impatient, and the door has taken a small step forward: "No, I have already thought of another solution. Finally, once you confirm, all you need is these bright treasures, not spending them. They are correct?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Maralha asked with vigilance, "What do you mean?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I can give you at least three times the return." Ningmen replied, "You don't have to pay any attention to the stocks, the humans are screaming out of the mess. As long as you put the Tibetan When the treasure trove moves over, I guarantee that you can grind the scales in gold three times more than it. Moreover, three times is just the beginning, and the gold and jewelry inside will only be more and more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three times this number made Mara’s ear move, she couldn’t help but repeat it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three times? Is it three times the number just now? You are not laughing, young humans? That is my savings for two thousand years!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least three times." Residents nodded decisively. "If you just need these coins and treasures."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This number is responsible for the person in charge of the upcoming new banking business, Metty Crosso's face changed. She glanced at her accountant and made up her mind to shout: "Three times no, it will be very difficult -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She only shouted here, Suddenly, he took back his fingers in amazement and held down his right ear in a panic to accept a new communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That triple refers to gold and gems, not the actual currency to be issued."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Bonnie Sefer from the future with a smile. Just like to annotate her tips, Nana is also continuing to say the conditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, we will also replace some of the gold and jewellery on a regular basis to ensure that they bring a fresh and enjoyable sensory experience to your Highness."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver Dragon suddenly understood: "You are not trying to build a new big vault? It sounds like it is not the same as what I want." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But is there a difference? Is this vault different from your treasure chest? You can transplant all the treasure guard systems that the dragon is good at. You can use Triple gold and jewels decorate this Weilong's treasure hole."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mara hesitated for a long while, looking at the enthusiasm of the door, and finally a little reluctant Nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I think it's no different from my treasure house... well, at least it's three times bigger. You persuaded me." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I can accompany you to the most important investment dragon to choose a new treasure house." Nanning took a deep bow. “I have just a few guests from the Imperial Orthodox Church. If this makes you feel comfortable, they can also be together.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Now? "A few moments before Mara’s tentacles trembled a few times, and the arrogance was inevitably lowered. "Now is it convenient for you? Is there not a lot of important rituals?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the face of an important investment dragon like you, the schedule can be changed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is turned to Bonnie, facing She blinked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe that the next thing, as the Lord Bishop, can handle it very well for me. Ms. Yinlong, please here." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is almost a half-compulsory attitude to drag Silver Dragon and Olia from the dock area, Ionite reluctantly followed them . The surrounding crowd with a surprised expression consciously gave way to him and his guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is really a sudden, a few."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hoofs of the few people After disappearing, Bonnie Seifer went to the crowd. She looked at Metty first, then looked at the army and navy's school officials, eunuchs, and finally stopped looking at Zhang Shiyi's hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand. This thing is already done." Zhang's female sergeant nodded. "The so-called strategy is not only used by the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Bonnie's fingers draw a semi-circle in the air, and all the people who are whispering in the distance are covered: "has it already started?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. At the latest, within five days, the news will be known to all around the narrow sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Zhang’s reply, Bonnie’s eyes plundered A little praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well. The imperial people will certainly not believe this anti-countermeasure - unfortunately, on the thousands of kilometers around the phase port, the most Just one or two thousand imperial people. Soon, people will know that the Southern Army Command of the phase port has a silver dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry to interrupt What happened here, I am going to pass on to the commander of the guard. Can I borrow one or two bishops of the church? My ship's master and pastor are not here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Into the navy is the representative of the Navy, General Fisher. Bonnie looked at him and nodded in agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So urgent? The Seventh Fleet will have an action soon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes We want to try how long Interreus can take his fleet torment. I am afraid it will be in these two days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "By the way, give it to me." Farnes off the coast to send a sub-fleet..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people in the inner circle exchange information and chill, the citizens on the outer circle are already there. Under the encouragement of the gossip, it entered the commotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that really a dragon? How does it look like a woman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The real dragon can be turned into a human form."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But where is the dragon? Why are we talking with our temporary governor?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dragon... Anyway, it’s not ours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom of the country has never been able to win the dragon support. In fact, the southern countries that have not established a country for less than a hundred years do not want to say dragons. There are not many flying World of Warcraft such as pterosaurs or Pegasus, and it is not enough to compile an air force. Compared with the powerful weapons and magical forces of the Free Army, the Air Force is their biggest weakness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that it is one of the empire's Ssangyong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The glamorous woman "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dragon can be turned into a human form. Legend has it that in the east soil where the holy deer are located, even the emperor himself is made up of dragons." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you here? Come to aggression? Should we run away?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, look It’s very friendly... Doesn’t the empire decide to support this company?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Maybe it’s true. You see, the emperors’ ambassadors went out. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret of manipulating public opinion is to disseminate a variety of plausible inferences based on solid facts. The advisers of Zhang’s in the Hengqu clearly understood this. In the short time before the official opening of the exchange, they have spread a lot of news around the "Silver Dragon landing in the phase port." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So to say...does the prophecy of the Archbishop really come true?! Even the dragons of the enemy are coming to join..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sanson Oriental Company has been arrogant for two hundred years, and their monopoly rights should be over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look Today's transaction price and contract bidding will increase the price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, look, even the silver dragon has made a special trip..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of the reason, this fact is enough to give people a strong confidence: the days of counterattack in the narrow sea are coming. Only a small group of young women in the corner, and some small businessmen with similar situations and their brows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can estimate that the upcoming bond trade and military supplier auctions will be a tough fight; for these girls, They didn't even give up the qualifications. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter how it counts, I feel that we are not getting enough money today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identity It was the "Wai Cui Xing" Dao Law Consultant. In fact, Bai Ruisi, a remnant of the phased Hong Kong Thieves Guild, was contemplative and summed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Big sister, do you think it will go up so much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least 30%." Hear In the question of Di Meiyi, Bai Ruisi replied, "Although everyone knows that this is just a big show today, the archbishop and the dragon can't do it. After such a strength show, the increase of 30% is considered to be small. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She closed her eyes and rubbed her nose. This is the relaxation gesture she learned as a "white silk" in the Orientals of the Thieves Guild, forcing herself to calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it's not enough... then we're going to use that lot of goods. Maybe, there won't be any big problems."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the crowd squirmed again. I can hear the shouts of the gendarmerie and the militia who are responsible for the guidance, as well as the shouts of ordinary clerks who are urgently requisitioned from major commercial banks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The new concessionaire and United Bank bonds will be available for subscription to these warehouses, factories and fleets, and can subscribe for future shares! All military supply orders Both can be paid in the form of bonds and will receive a considerable return! We accept all the supplies on the list! All those who cooperate with the independent gendarmerie will receive considerable rewards!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was a passionate afternoon, and the scene was so hot and intense that it was difficult to describe it in words. The trading rules were temporarily changed four times, and even the Archbishop Bonnie Sefer visited the scene to mediate disputes among churches, monasteries, and monasteries who had almost robbed these sacred contracts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money is almost flowing in the air, flowing between shouting and gestures. The banknote issued by United Bank was urgently stamped with a dragon-shaped seal, which was hand-carved by the Archbishop Bonnie Sefer, in which the sacred power exuding gave it a silvery glow. People use the attitude of relatives, referred to as this "long-guaranteed banknote" as the dragon banknote, and the bond printed with this seal is the dragon debt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the three who claimed to be "Huai Cui Xing" finally took a contract and a stack of bonds on the carriage returning home, they felt like they were dying. In general, it was more tired than the night when the thieves’ guild was swept by the gendarmerie with the thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our 'Wai Cui Xing' is also one of the more than forty military bargaining firms that have been recognized. At least, all three of us have left on the contract. The name, so there is a public identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After calmly crossing the phase bridge, Bai Ruisi sighed, back to the carriage seat by. Di Meiyi still carries a light carriage, and the thin Yin Rujing has long lost the strength to continue activities, and shivered against Bai Ruisi's thigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But today we can't rest, beautiful clothes. Although the rental time of this car has passed, we still have to go to the warehouse in Donggang." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Di Meiyi’s reins shook and let the horse turn to the road to Donggang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would we like to transfer the goods tonight, big sister? Will it be too sensitive? At the beginning of the thieves’ guild, many people knew about the supplies. "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So it’s better to move tonight. It takes about half an evening to transfer supplies, all the heads are at the party, Let's do it quickly.” Bai Ruisi smiled bitterly. “We can say that we bought this kind of goods cheaply at the fair – as long as the goods are transferred, the documents and the fictional middlemen are very good. Do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I copied new magic from the magic net and can summon a few invisible assistants to act as human hands. The spell doesn't look too difficult, you can practice it too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Their voices awakened Yin Rujing. The girl sensibly touched the dagger in her boots and asked, "Do you need to prepare other weapons?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope not."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first sunset hit the top of the warehouse at the dock, their carriage stopped in front of Donggang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to Westport, today’s Donggang is particularly deserted. If you look at the strait, you can see the eternal banquet lights and magical light above Westport, and even the lighthouses in the West Bank are brighter. Almost no large ships are moored in the port, and only the last few scheduled ships and barges from Westport are slowly coming into the port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We need some porters, and two four-horse heavy freight wagons, to the 16th warehouse! Night shifts plus 30%!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Di Meiyi waved his whip and shouted at the several foremen who had come up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the carriage flew to the warehouse management office, and Yin Rujing, who was nominally the treasurer of Huai Cui, had passed the bill of lading and settled the storage fee. Unsurprisingly, there are also gendarmes on duty, and the sons of Nylon Soledon have accurately penetrated into many key corners of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The pig iron of the 16th warehouse. The prepaid deposit expired for three days to make up the difference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They looked at the officials and the gendarmerie on the side with a little bit of worry, for fear that he would see the suspicious part of the 16th warehouse that had been kept for one month. Fortunately, these bureaucrats seem to be rushing to change their classes to go to dinner, the delivery of the grass, and even the wrong amount of the deposit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the "Embers" of the Phase Port Thieves Guild stood outside the warehouse filled with pig iron ingots. The three women looked at each other with a tacit agreement: Di Meiyi went to organize the workers, Yin Rujing took the wind, and Bai Ruisi went in to check the goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary wooden boxes, with ordinary iron ingots, are ordinary bag companies, and can't see any connection with the Thieves Guild. Only by careful inspection can we find special points in each box of iron ingots: on the smelter's stamp on their corners, there is a faint magical light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove the cadres who have died, and only she knows the secret of these secret marks. The guild chief mage who set them up was an old Eastern Taoist. He had just returned from the "Jade Ring" on that night after he had just returned the goods. Bai Ruisi took a deep breath and retrieved the memory of the trade union cadre “White Silk”. He pressed his finger on the steel stamp and whispered a whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only death can solve the answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now think of it, this slang seems to be ironic . The side of the iron ingot slowly opens to reveal the cargo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the material she and the guild had spent a month on the mainland to get all the magicians would need. Refined parchment, induction ink, fine gold powder... Most of them come from the black market of Lenny and Fort. The military materials management of the Emperor and the Free Army is relatively strict; relatively speaking, the management of the spoils is not so strict, but in the past war, both sides have accumulated a lot. Of course, the means they use are hard to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic materials contained in this warehouse are enough for tens of thousands of new and low-level wizards, enough to arm the two divisions’ magical forces. Left. Of course, the Royal Security Department and the Free Army Gendarmerie are probably also tracking the mass of bulky goods. Bai Ruisi even suspected that the phase port thieves guild was cleaned up, and it was also related to the quantity and sensitivity of the goods they got. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But only they can bring enough money. Unlocking the answer means death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp She sighed and reversed the whisper, closed the iron ingot, and ordered the terminal workers who knew nothing about it to come in and put the "Faisi Cast Iron" into the freight wagon. The two carriages looked a little lacking, but Bai Ruisi did not want to add a third one. Instead, he instructed the workers to put some of the extra iron ingots onto the rented light carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are we going to go, big sister? I am afraid that this carriage can't enter your residence?" asked Dimeiyi on a big car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have rented a room, I have never used it, just to put this batch of goods..." Bai Ruisi frowned. "Why, at night Does Donggang have no lighting? I thought they would order some magic lanterns."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Ruisi did not bring the oil lamp, he found an illumination from the magic net A spell that holds a blue ball of light on your right wrist. Under the blue light, she found out that in the darkness of the port exit, I did not know when two roadblocks made of logs had been erected! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"U-turn, as a mirror! Try to rush out from the north-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wind wiped from the ear of Bai Ruisi, hitting the carriage guard behind her, making a low and scary muffled sound. She turned her head and found that it was not a smashing arrow, but a spear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please don't resist. Although the goods are definitely not given up, there is no need to lose their lives, right? 'Miss.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Ruisi cast his eyes on the past and found that behind those roadblocks, standing about twenty or thirty people, headed like a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sighed and said: "Don’t escape, like a mirror, a beautiful dress, come to me. We have completely fallen into the trap of others. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The vision of your purchase on the black market is truly unique, Miss 'Bai Si', the view is also impressive. 'This city will definitely become a magic The center of the network. People will rush to the phase port from all over the world, learn and improve the paradigm magic associated with the magic net, preach new theories, and change the world with new experiments and conclusions.'"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the woman said this, Bai Ruisi’s face changed. This passage was said to the chief mage of the guild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s your people who captured the guild."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are just collaborators. The priest and the doctor are not enough, and the wounded are handed over to us for rescue, so I will be here.” The person hesitated, added, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Taoist priest is very badly wounded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Partners... Are you...the people of Zhang's family?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the channel of Zhang's channel, Zhang Shiyi."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman next to the roadblock waved her hand, and her followers ignited the torch , illuminate nearby as white. She has an eye-catching single pony tail, which is a strange gradient of black and gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Bai Ruisi let go of the reins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her two companions have jumped out of the carriage, but they are too nervous to speak. Strange to say, even in the face of such a crisis, she did not feel nervous at all. Perhaps, only people with short-term memory have not learned what to fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think, you are not just coming to this shipment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhang Shiyi Nodded: "I swept the property of the thieves' guild, and also secretly burned the books of the thieves' guild, making one-fifth of the members interested in the heroine who got rid of the cleaning of the thieves' guild. I heard her. The news, specially sitting on the last regular boat arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will not deliberately push down the dinner party? That really dazzled me." Bai Ruisi satirized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no need to be vigilant, I am not malicious, and I am not going to want you for this shipment." Zhang Shiyi spread his hands. "Whether it really has a Cui Xing, but it is already recognized as a military supplier. My intention is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let's join." Bai Ruisi interrupted Tao, "My real name is Bai Ruisi. If you want, continue to call me "White Silk"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
