			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only two men left in the room. Middle-aged people who used the name "resistant door" and young people who are using the name "resistant door". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man silently took off the luxurious black dress, hung it on the wall, and replaced it with his black wizard robe: "Okay. Tell me the truth. What happened in the past month?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of Soledon bite his teeth and deny it: "It’s like us As I said before, I rushed to Fort Vatican, took part in the great battle there, and made a contribution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Oh." Zalt slowly Sit down, pick up a sour cream and play on your fingertips. "Actually, we received a new letter from Jenny this morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing the mouth of the teenager twitching: "Oh? This morning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Of course, the things that are said inside, and the things you describe are subtle The deviation. I don't want to brutally force the truth, and there is no need for it. Tell the truth. Nothing to hide, right?" The mage chewed it. Cheese, leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a release of Sorelton’s face for a while, and for a while. When Zalt ate the fifth cheese and the third piece of chocolate, he squeezed out the next sentence: "You tried to marry me, teacher? There is no letter at all. If there is a letter, you will not be like This tricked me with words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "You are too tender." Zalt took out his pocket from the pockets this morning. Letter, on the table, "There is indeed this letter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of Soledon’s momentum: "That, that letter is impossible." There is something that conflicts with us! Or else you have already taken it out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Not necessarily. I am just out of mentoring, I don't want to Barbarically revealing your lies.” Fran smiled and added a tone. “In fact, what you said now, it’s a complete proof that what you said before is just a story. Let’s talk.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published the teenager biting his lip and bowing his head. He understood that his psychological defense had been defeated, but he could not tell the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published and said that he was shamefully mixed in the rebel army in order to save his life, leaving Jonica and his family to escape, and throwing his childhood in a group of unknown people. In the hands of adventurers? Or to say that he fled on the battlefield like a headless fly, and after he betrayed, he happened to arrest the commander of his army. He wanted to be greedy and gave it to Klad, but he was seriously injured by the friendly army. Finally, he was saved by Annie. Or is it that he is shameful about stealing from a girl and getting into a situation of confusion, escaping and facing reality? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post cannot be said. No one can say it. These things will never be written in the letter of Jenny, but I can't help but explain his current situation. He began to regret why he asked Annie to testify for him... Every time he met this girl whose smile was as bright as the sun, and the bad luck brought by the storm, the girl did not have a good result. It seems that this time is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "In fact, there is nothing to hide this kind of thing, youth is like this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Is it? What did you say on the letter?" After hearing this, Soleton gradually felt that something was wrong. He suddenly got up and grabbed the letter on the table and unfolded before his teacher reacted. He glanced at the handwriting of Reneka and couldn't help but smile at the corner of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "This, what is this... adventure team? Actually, what I said... I fell in love with a girl, so I decided to go to other City settled? I?...so you thought that Anne was the girl?... How could it? Don’t be kidding, the bad luck star...I don’t know if she is a lie, she’s not worse than me!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of Soledon finally laughed, laughing all the time and bending down the belly, laughing all the way to laughter and tears. He just groaned like that, laughing and laughing, laughing for about five minutes before he stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "There is no truth in this part of my letter. I didn't expect you to be wrong. In the past three weeks, I simply It’s not in Kengal, it’s been in Fort Fort. We’ve been lost on the 7th, probably she thought I was killed in the chaos... It’s so ridiculous, even the marriage is compiled, she Is there a lot of romance novels? Haha..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of Soledon looked up. The tears that just laughed didn't stop, and they still flowed on his cheeks. It was a tear of laughter and a tear of self-deprecation; he didn't know whether to cry or laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of Zalt went to the door and quietly closed the door. "If you want to cry, just lie now in the corner and secretly cry. This is the secret of our men, don't let the women see your tears. I will watch for you, here once the tears of remorse "That's enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Why? Why did she make up such a lie? Is it worth her to make up such a lie? If she knows that I am betrayed How many people who trust me, how many people who used to be deceived, how have they fought with friendly forces for greed, will they make up such a lie? Why am I such a person? I clearly believed I am different! But why can't I lead those who trust me? Why can't I save them? I have no talent, no talent, no guts, I can't turn things around, I just dare to turn my guns when I fail! I just A traitor, a coward, a coward..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "This is not surprising. Everyone has experienced this kind of thing: when we look back, we will find I don’t have For the kind of person you want to be. Maybe there is no talent, maybe there is no chance, maybe there is no will. You have not lost your past month, and you don’t have to regret it. There is nothing wrong with choosing to live.” Zalt is low. The baritone sounds like a narration of a sudden insertion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published "But I did... betrayed. Once, twice, three times... my loved ones, my comrades, my benefactors." Soledon With pain, "I see more people who have no mistakes are dead. Their death is as meaningless as my betrayal and deception!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published "But you really survived, this is enough. I was also facing you almost...no, maybe some difference. But I also chose to betray because I believe it is right As long as you believe that you are right, just do it, don't regret it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing Zalte in the bag inside the clothes, groping out A hollow badge made of iron. The badge is very worn, but barely can be seen in its original shape: the outer frame is two intersecting equilateral triangles, and the middle is three intersecting lines, dividing the entire pattern into six diamonds. Hollow six-pointed star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "This is the badge of the Imperial Arbitration Association?" The boy recognized the badge at a glance. The first time he saw Zalt, the badge was placed in the mage's wallet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "The warlocks who sneak around and swindle never fail. The average person can't admit defeat. And the real magician will face the failure and take him to move on." The power of this. This is the founder of the Arbitration Association, 'The last and the original magician' said Akann Lor. This is also the name he called the Arbitration Association as the 'Arbitration Association' and not the 'Mage Council'. Or the name of the 'Mage Guild': No one can evaluate the magician with criteria such as 'success' or 'failure'. Every indomitable mage is worthy of respect."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of Zalt recalled with a lonely look. After that, he bounced the iron badge to the eyes of Soledon at the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of "The root of arcane magic is 'rational'. A mage needs a strong will and a determination to admit defeat. Now it is yours." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish the teenager with the index finger and middle finger gently pick up the badge and look at it. The iron badge carries a little bit of symbolic magic, just enough to prove its identity. Obviously, this badge does not have the same special effects as the advanced badges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "I am not a member of the Arbitration Association." He raised an objection, "I heard that to become a member of the Arbitration Association, I have to try something... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "It's not proof of identity, it's just the key to allowing you to touch the door of the association. I don't have to hold it anymore, but you may not be able to It’s a day to use it.” Zalt looked at the sunshine outside the house. “They should come back soon, dry their tears.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post “Thank you The teachings and help, the teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish Solerton put the badge in the palm of the other hand and hold it hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "I will return to the Free Army and fight for myself and my country, where I will get my citizenship. I think the credit I have stolen now." I am afraid it is almost enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Released "Ah, I have already decided on the name, but I am afraid I have to get permission from the teacher. I want to use your name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published This answer, Zalt laughed happily: "I have to say early! Do you want to use 'Little Zalt Fran' or 'Zalte Fran II'? Do you want me to register as your adoptive father? Wei Lun will be very happy to hear..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher is so happy to see the teacher, Soledon corrected a little embarrassed: "Ah, no, teacher You will be wrong... I want to use your past name. To be honest, the name of Little Zalt. Fran is very poor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The release heard this criticism, and the middle-aged mage was taken aback. "Very... very poor. But in the empire, you can't choose your own name..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of his emotions immediately fell. Upon seeing it, Soleton couldn’t help but wonder: Did the teacher defect to the South because the empire could not be freely named? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "The past name is... which?" Zalt smashed with a weak, low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youngster took a deep breath and uttered his full name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published "Nelity. Nike. Soledon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soledon... Lonely person who doesn't exist? Why use this strange name? You shouldn't think that this name will make girls like you?" Zalt immediately seized the opportunity to fight back, "I think that I’m afraid girls won’t like this name.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling Soledon’s aunt, hurriedly retorted: “What, girl! I’m just like Anne. There can be no relationship, the kind of bad girl!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Hey, hello, whisper. Maybe she is listening outside the door..." Fran said with a smile and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Ah...!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish a girl's crisp scream. Outside the door came the sound of the iron plate falling and the porcelain smashing, and Zalt’s hand was stiff on the doorknob. Anne Seifer stood trembling at the door, half-mouthed, muttering something. Not waiting for the Master to react, the short blond hair has disappeared at the corner of the yard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing the door also stood up and stared blankly at her back. "It's really..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published "Girls are crying and running away, don't hurry to chase them?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of Zalt turned his head and reprimanded. The teenager woke up like a dream and hurriedly chased the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;released Anne Reese Seifer ran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Why? Why? Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing the lost chain is connected, everything It is already obvious. Such a weird name will no longer be used by others, and the age and experience will be basically right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Why is this kind of person? What I know is not like this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Publishing what she knows has many names. The innocent emperor, the immortal bird of the political arena, the last dictator, the shadow of the empire, the absolute calculator, the founder of reformism... plus the greatest magician of the modern era and the undead master, add up to that people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing the door. Hugh Coleman - meaning "the non-existent of Comania". The name itself is like a hint of his status: there are countless people who are in charge of the government of the great empire, but few can get rid of the shadow of this man's existence. People may follow his path, or fiercely change his policies; but whenever the international situation or domestic policy enters a crisis, the emperor and his subjects will still take him from the research institute or library in seclusion. Pull it out and put it in the troubled position of the "Imperial Prime Minister." This history has lasted for two hundred years. From the time she is now, two hundred years to the next. All of this is sleeping in her memory, no change in anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release she has given up in this world to find the real endurance. Hugh Coleman. Here is the world she wants to live, not the world she came from. This is not the past, but the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a new world that has been split in the timeline because of her will. It is impossible to find the door that she knows in any case. She has already had this level of consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "...but why would it be a kind of greedy, timid, cunning, non-existent guy!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published her to the shade of the corner of the yard, struggling against the rough bark with her forehead, but no pain at all. She can't wait for it to suddenly become illusory, and then let her know that she is just in a dream, not a parallel world she created herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;released but the facts cannot be denied. He is the only one who can use the sapphire pendant directly except her, because it was originally created by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Abominable... Obviously, I have made up my mind to stop chasing his phantom..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Published but she still can't control herself when she knows the truth. Ming knows that the person in front of her is completely different from her "that person". She knows that as long as she pretends not to hear or see it, she is a rational choice, but she still can't help but overlap their figures. From an objective point of view, this boy named "Nenmen Soledon" is a copy of "Nikemen Hugh Coleman" that Annie loves in this world. However, it will hijack a woman as a hostage shield, will fight against the country and make it difficult to make a fortune, and will falsify identity and resume for survival, and will fight against the friendly army in order to rob the merits...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The release of this unscrupulous approach for the purpose is completely different from the future of the door. It should be a man who is very demeanor even if he fails, and uses the skills and strategies of Zhengda Bright to make his opponent convinced. But behind her, this is a mortal who struggles to survive on the edge of despicableness. This is too far from her illusions and expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "You, are you okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing from behind, the teenager is panting sound. Anne's body is custom-made by wishing, and catching up with her pace is quite a hard thing for the average person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Don't come over! Things are not what you think!" Anne shouted out of control and stopped the boy's footsteps. She raised her right hand and wiped the blood on her forehead. The sleeves were stained with dark red, probably smashing a large piece of skin. After calming down, Anne took a step toward the trunk and prevented the people behind her from seeing her embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "I apologize for my unintentional speech, I can swear to the gods that I didn't mean it. I have no intentions for Miss Seifer... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a clumsy saying that he had no experience with the scene in front of him. The library's love poems and love novels have nothing to do with this, and the youthful stories that are heard on weekdays cannot be applied at all. He didn't know how to deal with a girl who didn't like it very much - her body and appearance were completely impeccable, but somehow, he always kept a hint of fear and a little inferiority to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "I said, things are not what you think. I don't care if you don't like me, don't care if you say that I am a bad girl, don't just imagine." I just suddenly felt a little... sentimental.” Anne’s wording was also a mess, and she was completely different on Peace Day. In her mind, she constantly imagined that "her" was standing behind her door. This unhelpful imagination made her logic into chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish (not for that sentence, then why are you inexplicably angry?) Resist the thoughts in the door, but dare not say so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "That... then where did I hurt you? I know that I am slow, always saying the wrong thing, doing the wrong thing. I know that I Every time I accidentally offend you, but I don't understand why."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;released an embarrassing silence that was almost between him and her It became a convention. Both of them were thinking about how to word in the next step. Finally, Anne couldn't hold back, violently turned around, her hands were inserted in her waist, her body leaned forward, and she really blurted out like a cannon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "In fact, you remind me of a person I know. You and his name are very similar to each other. I see what you do every time." Those shameful things just feel like he did these things! The shadows of the two of you overlap in my mind, which makes me feel confused! Why do you use bad means every time? Why can't you make a better choice? How do you want to be in the future, do you want to be a shameful politician, or a black-hearted businessman? Think about what you do in front of me every time. Things! For those trivial interests, what qualities can you give up?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
