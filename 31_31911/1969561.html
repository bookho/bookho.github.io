			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xi<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirate Kazmi who ranks eighth in the total amount of overseas rewards; Ksteelhorse said that today is a lucky day. At least before the encounter with the Emperor Kleon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before that moment, he successfully robbed a big fish: driving from the port of Ellivi to the north, preparing to go to the inner sea of ​​the Sansen luxury passenger ship "wearing No. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dano" is a so-called "merch" style three-masted sailing ship. The front and main rafts are cross-sail and the rear stern is a vertical sail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three masts should have been faster than the two masts of the pirate ship; but the ship’s hull is too large, greatly damaging the steering force and speed. This makes it easy for Kazmi to capture it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the offshore passenger ship itself does not have much value, but at best it can be towed to a nearby non-elf port to sell it. However, this passenger ship carries a special guest: the former mayor of the Vatican Municipality, wanted by the Republic of the Union. He is carrying his huge amount of money that he has accumulated over the years and wants to flee to the capital of the elves through the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, since the big pirate Katzmi has run into, the money has been collected with the private savings of other passengers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his iconic samurai sword on his back, Kazmi stood on the bow of the flat-bottom passenger ship and counted the spoils - very much amazing. By his side, there are more than 30 crew members and passengers on the ship. After all, it is a luxury passenger ship, and there are not many passengers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he is in a good mood now. In this way, he took a step toward the goal of the king of pirates. Should the reward be increased? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time thanks to you, Carl Ben; Black Rod. Although you haven’t been in the camp for a long time, it has brought a lot of intelligence. I don’t care. Your source of intelligence, from now on, you are our military division." The big pirate patted the man's shoulder next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thanks. However, my name is Carl Ben; black robe, not a black stick." The man named Karben; khelben "blackrobe" is gloomy. Answer. He did wear a black robe, a strange magic sign on his robes, and a black stick in his hand—although no one ever saw him use magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirates all think that this man is just a pretending mage; however, he is indeed a good military division. Since he joined the team a month ago, the income of pirates has at least doubled. I don't know why, he always gets accurate information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then how do I always think that your name is black stick? Is it confusing with something?" Katzmi sank. "I always think that the name of Karben has been heard..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The illusion." The sergeant replied. "As far as I know, there is no such thing as Carl Ben in the world; people with black sticks. My intelligence is always accurate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are Talking, there was another cheer from the cabin below. Several pirates ran out of the lower cabin and held several beautiful women in their hands. "Boss, we found women! They are hidden in the cargo hold!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "H, I think there are only a few old ugly women on the boat." Zimi looked at the women. Most are just young and plain, but there are two or three glamorous women who look like dusty women. "Don't go too far, we may have to keep a ransom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute." Seeing this guy’s eagerness to go back and share with his brethren, The new military division made a cold suggestion. "Hello, I think it's still a good time to restrict your hand. After all, this is a busy sea area, so let them not use their hands now. Otherwise, if we encounter a naval ship, we can't resist it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big pirate thought about it and nodded. "I agree with you, Karben. Now who dares to start messing up, let him go to the springboard. However, as far as I am concerned, I don't really believe that I will encounter the Elven Navy ship so skillfully. Even if I have encountered it, There are people who will become pirate kings, and there is absolutely no need to fear them..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss, there is a big ship on the west side of the sea, the elf sailing ship is full of sails here! The flag is a merchant ship, but at least it is a big ship of 80 tons!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Are you making an appointment, military division? Why do you predict so accurately?" Katzmi took a deep breath and smiled and replied, "Isn't it really an elf's warship? Hang up the slogan and tell Mark to let him rise." Sail, do a deterrent bombardment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, don't make a deterrent shelling." The black robe raised his palm and motioned his captain to suspend the action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" The big pirate is a bit strange. "In this situation, we should not provoke new enemies. If you can let the other party know, it would be better. Even if not, we can earn the opportunity to calibrate the artillery first."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military officer shook his head and replied: "No. It must not be a merchant ship, but a disguised anti-private ship of the Nassen Navy. If we threaten the shooting, we will enter the cannon." It is not good for us to have a small boat with fewer guns."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kezmi retorted: "But even if we don't deter the shelling, they will fire." If we first detonate the shelling, we will get the chance to correct the impact point first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, we have the opportunity to take advantage of the elves' self-righteousness. Boss should know, Why do those anti-private ships have to be loaded into merchant ships?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In order to paralyze us pirates... we are not paying attention and attacking us as merchant ships." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as we will count Counting, not tearing their disguise, making a looting look directly, we have a chance to fight hand-to-hand. With your samurai sword, our melee combat power will never be weaker than them. Offset the artillery. Advantages, they are nothing terrible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response, Kazmi carefully looked at the man who said these words. The man’s eyes were filled with eyes that were called “insidious”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are such a sinister guy, Karben. Is this why you wear a black robe?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, no. I just made the best strategy based on sound intelligence." The respondent's tone was very dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kezmi; Stehaus sighed and spread his hands and said: "Unfortunately, we can't follow this strategy. You know, Captain Mark is an acute child, and he will fire when he enters the range."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the second ship sounded on time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the sound of the cannon, Karben’s brow wrinkled: “It’s really an acute...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the big sailing ship opposite the pole changed the flag at the top of the mast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Far Sea Fleet! How?" The adjutant picked up the monocular and looked at the flag and whispered. He thought that he would encounter a vessel of the relatively weak South China Sea Fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Far Sea Fleet, hey?" Katzmi grabbed the telescope and only glanced at it and threw it to his military division. There is some disdain in the tone of the big pirate. He used to fight for many years in the sea between Xinzhou and is no stranger to the distant sea fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Far Sea Fleet...what." Carl Ben took advantage of the telescope and stared at the flag, revealing a mysterious smile - as if he had already known This flag rises the same. On the face of the black robe officer, there is always the expression of "everything is in my calculations". I don't know if it is bluffing or really brave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the main mast of the elf sailing ship, instead of the low-key trade union flag, it is the famous "cross trident" flag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue background, with two golden tridents crossed, plus an eye-catching "iv", this figure proves The belonging of the vessel. The fourth far sea fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the captain of the storm bring his boys back to the boat, leaving ten people to guard the place and get rid of it." Katzmi dropped the sentence and hurriedly turned around. Skip the pedals - but it was about the habit of the military division, and the black robe opened his mouth again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to respond. Mark's second ship must be unsettled since it opened fire in advance. Therefore, I must stay on this ship... "Speaking, the black robe did not know from there to find three beautifully woven brocade pouches. "Because I am not on the ship, if you are in danger or encounter an unsolvable situation, open these three." A small bag."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The second ship will not be able to keep it? This judgement is too early, I have not joined the battle yet." Kazmi took over The small bag, strangely asked, "What is this, is it a contingency plan? Why do you need to use such a good workmanship?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is a kind of oriental superstition The scheme must be installed with this kind of 'kit" and can be opened one by one to take effect. You should be able to understand the stubborn use of the samurai recurve knife? Of course, opening it in advance will also be invalid." The military division smiled secretly. Clap your hands. "I like the same thing, I also gave Mark. It sounds stupid, but it is very effective. It is worthy of the superstition of the four thousand years in the East."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, I will continue to believe that you are good... However, I don't think I will use these tips, what should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If using No, don't open it, just return it to me.” The military officer glanced in the direction of the deck. “I think, Hearn has already gathered people almost. You should return to the ship?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kezmi; Stewart turned and saw his number one fierce unicorn dragon Hehn was pulling out the hungry and greedy pirates from the cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out of here! You rabbits, don't touch the fish again! Stop searching, stop! There, no more women! It is the Nassen Navy, Their guns are twice as many as ours! Don't want to be smashed, hurry back to me! Go back and go back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other storm captains Struggling to regroup his men, Mark's second ship, the "black base", had already made three rounds of shooting with the elf ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Port side volley!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there is no such "tidy cannon ", but a piece of cannon that was intermittently smashed; black smoke rose up from the portholes and decks, causing people to feel a little uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf gunner looked at the wind direction and the starting point of the water curtain, and immediately corrected the elevation angle of the muzzle with his rich experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no shooting elements in this era--sliding guns are not allowed--so all the shooting adjustments are based on experience, the elves are extraordinary Experience has naturally become an excellent condition for the gunner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new elevation angle was simultaneously sent to the hands of the upper and lower deck gunners, and the crew began to reload with the new data. The mighty sailors used huge iron bars to pry new shells and propellants into the artillery, making a "squeaky" sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hit seven shots, enemy shots destroyed three!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three observers quickly Reported the results. Upon hearing a satisfactory result, the captain of the Emperor Klein, the iron wall admiral Fei Long; Leton Siti, waved his hand and updated the new order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called "iron wall" means that he has an extraordinary ability to evade command. After all, iron boats cannot be driven by sails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Receive the sail, left full rudder, evade!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that the counterattack will then Will come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The naval battle of the sailing era, and the javelin of the classical era is very similar to the throw: you round, I round, you round, I round, until both sides Not enough javelin. All of this, there is no art, no beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Receive the sails - left full rudder - evade -!!" The order is in the form of shouting, passing on the deck full of chaotic noise . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sails were pulled, the southwesterly wind had grown a bit, and the ship made a beautiful sway, drawing a hyperbola on the sea. The open side was adjusted from the port side to the starboard side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reporting losses! Reporting losses!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Losing one shot! Two hits on the deck, no water leaks! Death one, falling water two, hurting one! Filling half Finished!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This round of artillery is ahead of schedule! Repeat it, the shelling is advanced! All the filled tanks on the starboard side can be fired immediately!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another round of mutual shelling began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Side quietly on the deck, Reza; Helmont thinks it's a bit stupid. There was a shell that almost hit her beloved demon. She had to catch up and risk her own property and strength. She, and her golem, are good at close combat; at this distance, they are completely powerless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the deck to the bottom compartment, everyone, everyone, everyone screamed wildly, and she felt that her eardrum was almost broken. One of the people she is familiar with is not here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lenard is not here, I can understand...but where did the slave a and the slave b go?" Retha said to herself, looking for Those familiar figures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哼,哼,哈,嘿!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned to the left, left is a group of sailors Struggling to twist the direction of the front sail, I plan to make another maneuver while still facing the wind. The sailors were naked and shouting; most of them were humans and half-orcs, and the leader was a real troll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"砰,砰,砰,咣!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn your head to the right, the right side is the half-elves And human gunners, almost all members of the sea corps are here to help; they may not be able to operate the gun door, but they can use the bomb to smash the shells, or carry the shells. The three-pound light cannon is not heavy, and it piles up behind the deck. It seems that at least the 17 cannons on the upper deck (loss one) and 20 rounds. As for the gunpowder warehouse, it is hidden under several decks and can't easily hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow, ah!" The scream of the female voice was uploaded from the top of the head. The alchemist looked up and saw her entourage a doing a very difficult aerial acrobatic performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rope draws a smooth curve in the air, rushes with a huge impulse falling from a height, and falls back along the same trajectory. Annie hangs at the end of the rope, swings like a pendulum, and then sways to the bow, and then sways to the stern, and passes through the central mast every time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her cry is hidden in the noisy surroundings; Reza can barely hear something like "Scratching the rope is difficult~! Not at all Handsome is not cool ~!" complains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Leisa squinted at her mouth and found a bullet hole, so that the magic image pulled a piece of broken plank from above. She used magic to turn the plank into sharp iron plates on both sides, and visually examined the length of the "body pendulum" swing rope; after completing the preparation work, she decisively gave Ganda an order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twelve feet in height, the main mast, cast!" The sharp iron plate was thrown out with the wind, and then it was deeply inserted into the 12 feet of the main mast. High place. At this time, the human pendulum has fallen back from the highest point and is in the stage of acceleration...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! You can't use that method! Yes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Anne; Seifer's super-frequency scream, the thick cable was instantly cut by the sharp edge of the iron plate. Losing the tension provided by the cable, her body flew horizontally in the direction of the bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not worry, I will catch your ... force wall!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; The alchemist waved his hand carelessly, and an invisible wall appeared in the front of the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The force wall has not lived up to the expectations of the user, it will stop the girl flying at high speed, before she flies out of the deck and falls into the sea A very violent collision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment the collision occurred, Reza’s face became iron blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
