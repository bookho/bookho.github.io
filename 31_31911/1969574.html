			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;February 14 Difen Island eoco coalition base storm<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;small hang gliding with strong wind Landed on the only landing site on Dieffen Island. Its wings are marked with bright red in bold red: "e183; general." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;endless oceperr, the Pan-Norwegian Uniform Cooperation Organization, one of the three most powerful national groups in the world. The reason why the two languages ​​are used is because the big country headed by the League of Nations uses two languages ​​as the official language. Many years after the end of the civil war, people have rebuilt a new world order and are immersed in long-lasting peace. The old world is recovering from the pain, and the new world is emerging under the cover of isolationism; eoco is the spokesperson of this new world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a telegram here?! Urgent news, shoot to Port of Wilhelm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glide The wing did not stop, the occupants on the top jumped down and shouted loudly to the ground staff. He forgot to eliminate the wind, and the hang gliding again vacated, drawing an arc disappearing into the sea outside the island. In this "post-war reconstruction era", the modern magic industry has penetrated into every aspect of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" The ground crew ran up and asked eagerly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fantasy! It’s a magical wind, the magical wind has appeared! Now all the magical connections between the Old World and the New World have been completely interrupted, and it may have spread to the entire North.洋!!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hang gliding driver's hand is arbitrarily drawn in the air, wanting to emphasize the importance and urgency of this information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?! Fantasy! Are you sure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this report, ground handling The staff did not dare to neglect and immediately notified the person in charge of the landing site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word seems to have magical power. When you hear the word "magic wind", the person in charge rushes over like a blast - there is really no exaggeration in him. A significant acceleration response can be detected on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The magical wind has spread to the Taryn Islands and will arrive here in about 15 minutes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This report scares everyone to jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"15 points...?! Immediately before the magic wind arrives, use the expedited telegram to inform the city of Weilun, the capital of Beixinzhou, and the capital of the free country, Lenny, temporarily closed. All flights and routes through the endless ocean! Release hidden warnings throughout the island, ready to use the underground preparatory tower!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire landing site is busy at once The control tower madly issued a radio warning to each of the flying objects in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, where is the Magic Wind Center?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About 45 degrees to 52 degrees north latitude Degree, between 36 degrees and 40 degrees west longitude."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much is the wind speed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The maximum wind speed is 54.7 meters per second, and the wind is 16.6. Because the illusion is too dangerous, our monitoring station can't detect more.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...fortunately, it is the most desolate central area of ​​the endless ocean. The magic wind is here, it is our luck. If it appeared in the center of Beixinzhou as it was 80 years ago, at least 100,000 people will die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" According to historical records, the imaginary wind is likely to last for a few months or even a year before moving to the next world. It may move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Those things at that time, then let's talk about it. In the ancient records, there will be a magical wind in two or three centuries. record of… But it has appeared six times in 50 years. Last time... Was it the time in Emman in 1889? The two army divisions there passed unfortunately, it was a disaster."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are the consequences of the excessive development of modern civilization..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At this time, there should be no flights. Ah, wait a minute, there may be an airship. Sikman International Airlines, from DeLand to Port of Wilhelm, is..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Checking the flighter's face instantly turns into a cyan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Qi, Zeppelin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The pride of the Emperor ',Zeppelin?'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes... the Zeppelin number of 1,200 passengers."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was built during the war, with the title of "the second largest man-made aerial flying body in history" - just smaller than the Xiangkong battleship Antig Grove. It is equipped with magic shield, dual power, and alternate floating forced landing system, which is one of the iconic miracles of modern civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embarrassed silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you contact any voter or senior pastor who can use Resurrection Magic? Resurrection costs, the insurance company will reimburse it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 minutes ago North Endless Oceans Fantasy Center<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind up. Meet this wind on Valentine's Day ...will it be a bit unlucky?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman with golden long hair and turquoise eyes casts her eyes on the sky outside through the porthole of the airship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the center of the endless ocean. It is thousands of kilometers away from the New World and the Old World, and several kilometers from the ionosphere and sea level. She glanced at the altimeter that she carried with her, to be precise, at an altitude of 4,400 meters. For an airship accustomed to soaring in a cloudless sky, this height is actually a bit lower - of course, this is not without reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow, black, and green clouds form a huge spiral that spins like a washing machine's drum; red, blue, and purple lightning flashes across the clouds Jumping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious storm from a different dimension, the "magic wind" that only appeared once in a decade, is the world’s most destructive natural disaster. The power is far better than the typhoon. As long as it appears in densely populated areas, it will cause a huge number of deaths and injuries. This kind of disaster is also a feature of the magical world - the higher the magical use, the easier it is to lure the storm. In the past 100 years, the number of magical winds coming to Akrania has exceeded the sum of the past thousand years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is ironic that due to the high concentration of the core elements of the illusion, there will be a magnificent view there. A variety of magical flashes are intertwined, and the spectacular sights are like tens of thousands of fireworks at the same time. The Zeppelin class airship is already a giant in terms of human standards, but it is still very weak under the natural power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s beautiful. Is this the so-called 'glory in the storm'? Maybe the magic of our world is inseparable from this magical wind. "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, although in the Origin of Species, although the natural evolution of biology is discussed, it is the magic net and source that promotes the force of evolution. The source has always been a mystery..." The brunette sitting next to her subconsciously followed. She looks younger, her hair color, looks and blondes are completely different, but the facial features of the two are very similar. "Wait a minute! Now is not the time to watch the scenery!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde smiled and pulled her eyes back into the cabin. "However, rather than being like them, is it better to calm down?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cabin has already become a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every passenger, the protective magic of the boat is expected to last for 16 minutes and fifteen seconds. The magic concentration here is too high and the boat is about to lose control. Please keep calm..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just kidding, how can you calm down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Why... why do you encounter magical winds! I have not done anything that is unspeakable..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, ah... I don't want to die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss, how do I let you meet before you die? Three minutes, enough... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brunette had a elbow on the waist of the man and stunned him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are right, my sister. It should be calmer now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hold, Sorry! Excuse me, please, are you a sister of Quillahiya who is an executive member of the Arbitration Association?" I didn't know when a middle-aged man with a beard was interrupted and interrupted the conversation between the two. He wore an airline uniform and looked very stable, but his tone was a bit flustered. Hearing his words, all eyes were concentrated here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." The blonde nodded. "We did have a position in the Arbitration Association Committee..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pulled out the document, which was marked with a striking circumscribed six-pointed star pattern - the world Each mage is familiar with this pattern. There is a photo that looks very young and a date signed in 1891. "Rice, Reese; Quillahiya. Executive Committee of the Central Committee of the Arbitration Association."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"McLai, Meliyana; Quillahiya. The brown girl answered. "Executive Executive Committee."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a lot of noise around. The frenzied people calmed down and whispered with their loved ones. The “Executive Association Executive Committee” is the best magician in the world. The magical power that these people have mastered is by no means comparable to ordinary people who are usually enrolled in elementary schools, middle schools, and universities. If these two women... No, these two ladies are really members of the committee and want to come and wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Great! So, both of you are professional magicians." The middle-aged man was excited at once. "I am the captain of this Zeppelin airship. You are the top magicians, there must be a way! There are one hundred and two hundred lives here! There are eighty mothers in my family. Younger..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His speech is incoherent--however, at this time, this is understandable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quillahiya sisters glanced at each other. They live together for so long, even the simplest eyes can convey everything. This time, their views are surprisingly consistent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the trouble is big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, do you know what the magic wind is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing Mary Asked, the captain shook his head. "Sorry, I can only use some of the simplest magic... and I will return it to the teacher soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fantasy is a magical storm. From The world in which purely magical energy exists - the term is called 'plane" - the magical storm that comes from it. A magical storm composed of pure magical energy. This storm accommodates a huge amount of pure source, the reason we are Being able to use magic, in the current hypothesis, is because mental power can operate these sources to a certain extent. The magic wind has always been a very interesting object of the magic net researchers, many people think that the magic net that supports the world is "The illusion brought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mellyana was explained in an orderly manner, as if she was standing in front of the magical theory class at the University of New Beijing. However, the students who are listening now have little patience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whenever is it, say that it is useless!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry up with you The magic comes out of the dilemma, you don't have to die together!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd that has quieted down has started to stir up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the captain, they began to be impatient: "Miss, can you make a long story short? Our protective magic can only last for about 15 minutes." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will be as soon as possible." Mai Li smiled a little - her smile was quite skillful, it was a kind of soothing smile. “As I said earlier, the magic wind brings a lot of sources. This concentration is enough for all the existing magic to enter the dangerous critical area. Use magic here, than in the 'magic violent area' Magic is a hundred times more dangerous. Even small magic, such as lighting, healing, and detection, can become fatal fireballs, positive energy perfusion, or deadly rays. Those who transmit magic, protect magic, summon magic, are even more It will have a completely unpredictable effect. In the magic wind, you must never use any magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Never use any magic...that is..." The captain repeated it with a trembling voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melly did not say the answer, she knew that this answer only meant despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is impossible! Can we only pray if we can do things? Can we wait here for the countdown to the disappearance of protective magic? ?!" A young man couldn't help but rushed out and shouted. He is wearing a uniform similar to the captain and should be a crew member. "Even if other things can't be done, it's okay to add a layer of protective magic to the airship!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! No one knows this. What are the consequences of using magic in the storm..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The female genius is so timid! If the protective magic is excessive, what can be dangerous? I am also the magician of this boat. It is the responsibility to protect it and the passengers on it!" Then the man gestured using magic. "protefrom energy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop! If there is a difference in protective magic, it is the attack of the corresponding attribute energy..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melly eagerly wants to stop, but it’s too late. The huge hollow energy mass gathers in an instant, sweeping the mighty airship. Even those who have only passed the basic magic training in middle school can see the power of this energy group. The involuntary screams filled the cabin in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like it...?" Mai Li raised her hand and let go. This level of resistance is useless...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, a hand was placed on her shoulder. It is a warm hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the name of the soul, start! Offset energy shock!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a crisp spell The sound of blue light spreads through the air and embraces the entire airship. The energy group hit the blue light, and the speed suddenly slowed down and slowly dissolved into it. Everyone turned their attention to the source of sound and blue light - the blue pendant is shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melly turned her head and saw it shining on Reese; Quillah's chest. Mai Li’s face is full of “can’t believe” look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That thing... the soul of the soul, can actually work in the magic wind?! This, how is this possible..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riss smiled. "I never doubted that it can withstand the interference of the illusion. You know, this is the 'that person' thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you use magic? That's great, we still have some hope." Mai Li said a little hope in her mouth, but there was no joy on her face. "Unfortunately, we can't let you completely use the power of that thing to save everyone. It's good to use it as a catalyst, but to use its power completely, it is life!" That person's use Of course it is not a problem, how can you use your sister casually!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear the last two sentences, the people who just wanted to ask for help face each other and swallow the words back. In the belly. Let others sacrifice their lives to save themselves. No one dares to ask for such a request. There are more than a hundred people here, all of which are transmitted to safe places outside of Wanli. It is not enough to think about a life. Several people wanted to beg or intimidate, but after seeing Reese; Quillahiya's eyes, they also changed their minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a very firm, unrelenting look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"McLa, let’s try it. We can’t send it, but we can take the power of the illusion...so we don’t have to go to Los Alamos. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?! Open, what kind of joke, sister? And don't say whether you can get it or not... You, are you determined to do it? Really? May die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a chance. We are not bringing those things this time? We have enough modern science to crystallize. Not under Allah. Moss completed the magic, and it was the same here.” Reese took a piece of paper from the pocket and handed it to the captain. “This is a consignment note, and you are having trouble removing our goods from the cargo hold. Please do as soon as possible, we are only 10 minutes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knew that she could not reach the realm of that person--but she believed that the magic that she had studied with youth was effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have completed that magic... I should have completed that magic. No problem... no problem." She repeatedly stressed this to herself. a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusion will only appear this time, she only has one chance. Focus all your power on this magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world, the spirit determines the power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She believes in her spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stone of the Sage, also known as the Elixir, is a liquid gel that can support and increase most of the magical reactions that were once called in ancient times. As a 'miracle of alchemy', rediscovering the manufacturing method in 1883.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guangzhou Iron and Steel, the latest achievements in metallurgy, hardness, magic conductivity, processing all Very good, better than Mithril, fine gold several times of excellent magic materials, completed in 1892 by Far East Xinjing Nonferrous Metals Co., Ltd.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Priest Crystal, At present, the world's best magic crystal, the source output rate is the highest among the known synthetic materials. It was discovered by Priestly in the era of innovation, but it was not able to be artificially synthesized until the end of the continental war.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing these materials, people who know the current magic items will swallow. These things carried by the sisters of Quillahiya are all developed by modern scientific methods. The best crystallization in a decade. Due to the use of unstable magic techniques, these The yield of finished products is quite low - probably between three ten thousandths and ten thousandths - so the price is very high, it can be said that the price is worthwhile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Do you really want to use it, sister? This is the channel that we used in l articraft trading ltd, Magical Items Trading Co., Ltd., and it took a lot of energy and money to get it. To get back that much, it takes at least another six months. What's more, the danger of this new magic experiment..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Needless to say, Mai Li. I have to do what I have to do, and I must do it. I have the ability to let you and I escape from here, but I will not leave helpless people. "Riss put Huigang in place and used his sapphire chain to draw a deep gully on it. The hard alloy is as soft as cream under the pendant." Moreover, this is not new. Magic experiment. This is the magic that the person has done, I just want to reproduce it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't be irresponsible like that person, isn't it?" It’s been ten years...you still haven’t given up. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will not give up." Someone has changed the life of others without authorization, and then left irresponsibly. Do you say that I can give up revenge? "Riss smiled--Mai Li saw a bitter bitterness from the smile." Again, we can be regarded as a researcher who receives the people's tax. It’s too irresponsible to abandon them and escape. Even if there is a glimmer of hope, we should try it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meliyahna interrupted her. "Do you know how big the risk is this time? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Even if I have to give my life, I will try it once. "The answer is as if it is already ready to face. "Is there a big difference in completing this magic here or there? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you can only use that magic once. There is only one wish - only one. Are you sure you want to use that magic? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to use. Reese stretched out her left hand and gently patted her sister's shoulder. This body language is a secret tacit agreement between them. "Reassure, everything will go well." The magic can save people here, should it be worth it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melly Yana turned sharply, her left hand drawn a beautiful arc, accurately colliding with her sister's left hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a crisp, decisive "啪".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She showed a sly smile." Then, let's do it together. This will be smoother, isn't it? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reese groaned and felt a little shy, her face burning fever uncontrollably. She looked at the captain and the captain had already had tears in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I was in the war of the mainland, I was a soldier on the airship of the Coman Empire. I also sailed for twenty years after the war. But this is my first time. I feel that even if I am destined to stop here, I will not be born."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where, where, here is my responsibility..." Reese rushed to defend . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, there is no responsibility here. The only person responsible is me." The tempered magical length was also inserted, his head has been Low, it seems very shameful. "My recklessness has made the situation worse..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know who is not guilty, it doesn't matter... after all, you are not an expert in the outside plane..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are not a lady, we are already dead. You are an arbitration association, no, it is the pride of all magic users." The magic continued. "Even if you can't save this airship, or if you want to leave on your own, there won't be anyone here who hates you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear these words, Reese Zhang Opening, I seem to want to say something, but I can’t say it. Her lips swayed, but no sound came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Additional..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain and the magician spoke at the same time and said the same sentence. "...must be alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riss avoided their gaze and turned to her sister. "It's only 8 minutes... let's get started, get the materials ready, let me do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was just a complete piece of Huigang ingot, now it has become A circular table top with a complex magical array. Reese "draw" this magical array in front of her own pendant, and Miley pours the "stone" of the sage out of the flasks and fills them into the magic array. The rainbow-colored semi-gelled liquid flows into the magic array, and immediately emits a brilliant glow due to the illusion of the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About four minutes."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took only four minutes to complete such a complicated array, then the time should be enough. After drawing the final stroke on the magic array, let the whole circle connect, Reese thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melly, Priestley crystal sixteen...no, seventeen. Twelve small, four, one big-- We should have a 10 cm diameter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reese quickly did mental arithmetic, and put down the Priestley crystal that can be used as a source buffer in the key position of the magic array. After being placed properly, she untied the necklace on her neck and prepared to put the soul pendant into the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fall of the soul trembled with her mood. Really want to put it in? If it fails, it is really possible to lose this most important monument forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only memorial left by that person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But without it, you can't have the power to complete this magic--the highest peak of two hundred years of modern magic science. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stared at the blue light with a complex expression on her face. This expression is not an obvious expression such as sadness, joy, or distress, but a mixture of various expressions. In general, it can be described as "lost" or "depressed." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sister? I can only support for another two minutes. What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mai Li The voice made her refocus her spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah... sorry, I will continue now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reese read the initiating spell in her heart--as the curse quietly sang, the Stone of the Sage began to flow in the circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Start!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the entire phantom stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stopped completely and stood still there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people look at the outside with incredible eyes--the original radiance becomes a shining color crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the New World to the Old World, the magical winds over the entire North Endless Ocean have ceased. The magic net stopped moving and the time was still here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the kingdom of heaven?" Looking at the illusion of the stars, more than one voice sighed in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical wind that has solidified. When the defensive magic effect can only be supported for less than a minute, the magic wind solidifies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We...have we been saved?" the captain asked in a trembling voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not yet." Mai Li replied. "Now is the most dangerous start. Energy is stored there, if it can't be released or transferred, then..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But will you succeed?" In all the legendary stories, this kind of occasion will be solved perfectly, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope so."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer is my sister Reese. The headwinds started running again, and this time all the light was concentrated around the airship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I swear by my soul, I declare with my power; bring together all the possibilities in the world, change the destiny of the world... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd is screaming, but Reese; Quirashi has no time to listen to these voices, and she can no longer hear them. Melina was a little surprised - she didn't know that her sister had finished the magic. This magic, called "the greatest achievement of the era of reason", is one of the most proud achievements of this world of magicians...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is That person "the last, the strongest magic." The ule wish, the legendary wishing magic that can compete with God and realize any desire of the person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Concentrate all the power and existence, use this magical wind for my...the ule wish, listen to my inner desire..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wish? This sentence made her heart tremble. At the beginning, what exactly did he fulfill his wish? That wish, is it necessary to let him leave me forever? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what is my wish? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She no longer thinks about these issues. All this, let it go. Let this natural force fulfill the most secret desires in the depths of your mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let it be realized! Follow my wish..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of the magical wind Filled with her whole body, it radiates a flowing iridescent glow, like a statue that is pieced together with neon lights. The pendant in the center of the magical array also glowed in an iridescent color - immediately returning to the calm blue, followed by a dazzling light that split into countless light particles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it’s a huge flash of clichés - there’s always something like this in all thrilling movies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people wake up, the outside is clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The airship landed safely in the port of Weilun, with zero injuries, zero deaths, and two missing persons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magic wind has disappeared? How is it possible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It really disappeared. But everything The records show that the magic wind has indeed arrived here - and then disappeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
