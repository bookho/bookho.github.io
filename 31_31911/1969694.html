Fighting against the water is nothing but shivering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor woke up, and it was not purely a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold sweat sheds from his forehead and soaks the silk texture of the pillow. He remembered the big rout last night and remembered the escape that was dead in the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left the military minister and his reserve team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He abandoned most of his army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t even know how many people followed him safely to the main force of the North Road. The battle last night was too confusing. The two armies of more than 100,000 people fought around the dozens of districts of Lenny and their surrounding areas. His guards were also separated in the big melee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is war. It is a demon that no one can control, and all actions cannot be carried out according to the plan. Even the emperor of the world's strongest empire can't control it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The free militia and national army around Lenny also heard the wind, and they fought all night with the reconnaissance cavalry of the emperor. The squad of the court mages, commanders, and ministers were forced to leave the formation one by one. The emperor finally brought dozens of troops to the muddy area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t even remember when he arrived at the perimeter camp of the main force, maybe he had lost his memory before that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not as good as my father, he can at least choose to die in the artillery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The emperor reached out and tried to grab the scepter "power" around him, but caught an empty space. He remembered that he had left his scepter in Lenny. I don't know why, the bedboard underneath seems to be shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat up and found the ceiling overhead seemed strange. The ceiling was actually made of canvas -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Carriage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor recognized This is the empire's largest cargo wagon, used to transport twenty-four and thirty-two pounds of heavy artillery shells, and a large enchanted carriage that was towed by eight horses. If the Dukes need it, they will also use it to convert into their own heavy-duty center car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gustav himself has as many as dozens of heavy-duty horse-drawn carriages carrying various kinds of "Royal", including from the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra The instruments went to the various equipments such as the portable royal bathroom - but it was all lost to Lenny. Probably already robbed by the squadron, the emperor thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, you are awake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a little strange in the ear The female voice, Gustav took a few seconds to remember who the owner of this voice is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the latest visitor to his court - the righteous daughter of the Duke of Fegota. Of course, she also has a more sensitive identity, the daughter of the most dangerous enemy of the empire, and the Minister of Security once repeatedly reminded the emperor of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the emperor did not understand why he and she were the only ones in this carriage. Of course, there are actually cowards of the carriage and three or two guards who are on standby at the corner of the carriage, but in the eyes of the emperor, these are not considered to be status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my Northern Line main army. Yes, Princess von Fegota. What is the situation of my courtiers? Are they not here?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡?薇伦?????? F. Gogota put down the book in his hand and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor noticed that it was not a romantic novel that aristocratic girls loved most, but a "Statue Year of the Pegota Principality", which should be royal One of the results of the work of the Ministry of Security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛尼卡 did not rush to answer, but called a guard, let him inform the courtiers who were commanding the troops, and then sat down again. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must be wondering why you are only here. This is because your courtiers are busy commanding the army to advance to Lenny, only one person has nothing to do. If you are not qualified to listen to the secrets, they will leave me here and be responsible for explaining the situation when you wake up.” There is a slight resentment in the statement of Yanika. “Nobody can use magic anyway. No one can threaten your royal blood without magic. This arrangement is very safe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor pondered, and asked: "No one can use magic?" Then my court mages are in a meeting to study?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They have seen the supernatural magic structure." Renee recalled with the young genius After the conversation, "I said what happened in Lennie, they said that they saw a similar structure in the narrow south of Jena, probably a masterpiece of the same unknown magician. And about fifteen minutes ago, They observed that the unknown structure in the direction of Lenny is rapidly expanding. And connected with the broken structure near Jena, constitutes a much larger magical broken structure. This is not an anti-magic array, because all magic items can still work, but we have not figured out that people can not use The reason for the magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gustav frowned: "They can't even use magic, they dare to march to Lenni? Who is commanding the army, Whose decision is this? How can the 15th brigade of the main legion be mobilized so quickly..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor suddenly stopped his words, understood, and counted Cleared the cause and effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August 6th, the main army’s offensive was blocked. He transferred the Duke of Fegota back to Lenny and reorganized the siege during this time, waiting for the passage. The road in Jena was reopened. It seems that this army did not clean the road at all, but gathered up to prepare for the retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are preparing to retreat. After the Duke of Fegota returned to Lennie, they have given up on marching into Jena, right? Big decision, I didn’t know anything about the Duke and the Duke? The Minister of Military Affairs did not assign an agent. In the few generals left, who is so bold?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carriage Suddenly stopped. The wooden door on one side of the compartment opened, and a cold, hoarse voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s me, Your Majesty. It’s that I am doing the main thing they are going to retreat.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone has a nervous expression on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing them coming in, the serious expression on the emperor's face was relieved. He looked at the people who came in one by one, calling out the surnames of all the senior commanders of the Legion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aha. Marlborough, Fermat, Bacon, Hartmann. I will say that you will not be so bold. In the absence of a formal order from the military minister, he was prepared to withdraw his troops. No wonder my security department did not respond to this apparent arbitrariness. So, Naser, let me explain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello of the Security Minister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 also hurriedly stood up and bowed to the head of the person. Among these generals and senior mages, she only knows the person who is the leader. This person's prestige spreads the entire civilized world. In the free countries, everyone is more and more scented. The entire West Ruhrock-occupied area was almost screened by the Royal Security Ministry's agents, and the fleeing refugees were crowded with East Ruhr, the United States and Asia, and even as far as the Intres. In the previous Jena Blenheim double battle, he was the same as her, and almost lost his life in Jena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the security minister in the memory of the emperor, the current Sid is even more embarrassing. He looks like he has died once, his face is pale like a vampire, his eyes are bloodshot. Obviously, this person was supported by various intensified magic a few days ago, and now it is possible to fall down at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you lost a lot in Jena, Sid." Gustav glanced at Yanika. "It’s like I heard it. It’s going to be miserable.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is nothing, I was like this in the days before I met Orestein. Fortunately, the Free Army The pursuit is not as terrible as the loan sharks of DeLan.” Sid said while coughing. “The strength of the Free Army is stronger than we think. They have new magic and magic, excellent and deceitful senior command. An officer, a brave, and a low-ranking military officer, and a soldier who can fight to the last person and discipline."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor squeezes a word from his teeth "But if you retreat to Lennie, what can you do? If you have more than 30,000 people, you can let the southern rebels surrender, or can you change the supply from the stone?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid calmly nodded: "My original idea was to take the army south and then find a way to say You and the Duke of Figota, signed a peace treaty with the southerners. This peace treaty is even worse than the peace treaty of Orestein, and it is much stronger than the empire once again lost the emperor and into the civil war. If we persist, it is the inevitable ending. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the nobles in the carriage were half-steps with horror. This may be their innermost thoughts. They also lost confidence in winning the war. But they did not expect the Security Minister to publicly say this intention to the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior looked at the security minister in front of her astonishment, and what he said now and her impression of him completely could not overlap. She even wondered if he really died once and became a completely different person. Is this still the Secretary of Security who is as cold as steel? Is this still the owner of the Palace of Palenia? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gustav? Hugh? The Emperor Kirman was temporarily unable to speak, his right hand was on the bed: "Good, good, good, Sid, you are not my father’s personally hand-picked minister. It’s too frank and loyal. Then we are so anxious to march to surrender to Lenni, in case our defeated soldiers die too much, right, Sid? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Security Minister shook his head: "No, my Majesty. We are going to win the victory. Your adventure last night was defeated, it is for us." Another possibility has been opened. One is much more glorious than signing humiliation and covenant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice sounds like two frosted glass Rubbing each other, but unexpectedly firm and powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are going to win the victory, Your Majesty. Although you lost the battle, you are likely to win this war!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement is bigger than Gustav’s expectations. At first he even felt that this was the deliberate ridicule of the security minister: he laughed at the fact that he lost so much, and abandoned all his subjects. He used his trembling hand to grab his scepter and grabbed it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the remaining generals and the nobility joined together with Sid Nass’s point of view, Gustav had to make his own judgment. doubt. Everyone is saying, "Yes, Your Majesty. We are making every effort. Your hard work has reversed the whole situation." Their waist and excitement are not like fakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor calmed down and held his chin with his hand and nodded: "Go on, Naserqing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Sid's statement is very slow, but his statement is as clear as all the intelligence reports of the Ministry of Security: "Lenny is considered to be difficult to overcome because it has two unparalleled powers. One of the best known is its multi-layered walls and defense system, which has been proved to be difficult to break through the war of rebellion; the other one that is often overlooked is its people and organizational capabilities. Lenny can take its ten Tens of thousands of people have invested in city defense, which is impossible for all other cities. Last night, your adventures led to the defeat of our Lenni attacking army, but they also temporarily destroyed these two forces." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The former was arranged by the Duke of Figota, and he seized this time to destroy the walls of Lenny. But the latter," Gustav shook Shaking his head, "No, I don't think their army has been destroyed. Or, their damage. It won't be bigger than ours. In such a war, their officers can pull up the troops and repeatedly organize defenses. After a night, they must have rebuilt the army."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
