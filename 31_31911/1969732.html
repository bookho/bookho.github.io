			<div id="content">VI<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than a week of waiting, Chen Zifang finally stood on the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath of fresh, non-rotating sea breeze, as if to spit out the lungs, and began to look beyond port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening phase port shines as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beacons that symbolize the centuries-old traditions of the major families shine on the coast, and the lighthouses of trading companies that represent emerging forces are mixed among them, which are indistinguishable from each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun has not yet fallen, and the upstarts have lighted their own lighthouses for their own fleets. As long as you enter the Intresail Strait, the two sides of the North Port of the Phase Port are natural harbors, no wind, no waves, and even the hurricane will not visit here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war of freedom that has just ceased to cease, the lost capital and vast territory, the huge fleet that was damaged in the naval battle, for the city, it’s only on the trading market. The bad news only. Some people will go bankrupt, the lighthouse will change hands, but more wealthy people will always come in because it is the best port on the Eastern route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hundred years ago, the Comans took the city from the Murrayans, only to make the city more prosperous and stronger. Even if the flames of the Southern Revolution burned the emperor's coat of arms ninety years ago, the money brought about by the revolutionary economy is increasing. The phase port is not difficult to attack, but the people living here don't really care who is in power – anyway, no matter who is in power, ocean currents and sea breeze will not change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue-lighted phase bridge traverses the strait, connecting Donggang and Westport into one, hiding the natural harbor behind the horns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chen Zifang knew that the home port of the Seventh Fleet of the Freedom Navy was behind the bridge, even where the hurricane could not be blown. He was a member of the glorious fleet and followed the Navy Marshal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, he has to direct his own ship to destroy them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Received contact, everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hoarse voice sounded, Chen Zifang Get out of the way and straddle the body in a reflexive manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall, thin man in a black robe stood in the middle of the upper deck and slammed his foot on the board that had begun to decay. The man looked at the huge port in front of him and raised his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, the moment of marching has arrived! Raise the black day! Unmask!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing the command of the black robe man in the ancient elf language, the fleet's escort officer flashed a faint light in the eyes of the dark emerald, and quickly walked to the bow. His robes were used to wear a cloak. The shawl is embroidered with a purple rattan whip, which is the guardian of the Sansen people and the Senate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Sansen fleet, this fleet with black sails has the same escorts as the fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the name of the People's Republic of China and the Senate - Raise the Black Day! Unmask!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The magical device in his hand instantly turned black, shattered, turned into dust, and fell on the deck with the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the wind blowing to the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People in the Undead Empire do not call themselves undead. They call themselves "the empire of the dynasty" and call their army "the squadron." They are the glorious projections of the elves of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is called the Reconstruction Army, the army’s actions are always accompanied by the night--the arms of the undead army that cannot play all the forces in the sun. Really quite a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many people who can protect this guardian. For this fleet, the guardian is only a long-standing name, and the fleet is actually run by countless underworld creatures such as scorpions and zombie sailors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chen Zifang was originally a battleship captain of the Seventh Fleet. He followed Wei Taiping when the fleet was still the East China Sea Fleet. But after losing the sail in the naval battle, he chose to live and look at himself. The dying sailors and subordinates were transformed into zombies and shackles by the army of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Chen Zifang himself, was also the curse of death by the lich of the army, became a "friend of recovery" - or death, wholeheartedly Fight for the glory of the Elves of the Elves...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, in fact, not so wholeheartedly. But fear, cowardice, and shame made him have to fight under the banner of the sacred empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chen Zifang feels that being a death deed is not as free as being a vampire's Yi; but it is better than being beaten into flesh and blood. Much stronger. There are various undead creatures in the glory of the Elves of the Elves, and there are also the Necromancers who are willing to come and trust, but the most are the servants directly or indirectly controlled by the undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because each of the undead creatures controls the servants in different ways, their servants will occupy different positions in the Reconstruction Army. Take this boat as an example. Most of the stewards who are in charge of the helm and command the warships are death sins who are cursed by death. The gunners are mostly vampires and their Yi people. The landing Marines and commandos are a minority. The flesh and blood cockroaches are composed of a large number of zombies and cockroaches, and the shadows, ghosts and ghosts of the possessive action are also among them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Divided into two sub-fleet, one sub-fleet rushed to the Westport, one rushed through the phase port bridge to directly annihilate the fleet! According to the order, this time we take When you get out of the phase port, you will never leave, and create a new province here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead guardian who casts the black magic is loudly A dozen or so self-conscious people on the ship said that they would convey detailed orders to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now the phase port is the weakest church power. Since the new church is not in the church, no one can block the entire battlefield with the sacred realm! The arriving ship is concentrated to the west side of the fleet, and the ship is successfully abandoned on the beach!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The word "abandoned ship" passed to Chen Zifang's ear, and it was hard to bear. He was a pirate from the Eastern Route, and he only went to Wei Taiping in order to keep the boat. He also sacrificed all his subordinates to save the ship before he took the undead fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this vast sea, there is a ship to survive, he is so convinced - but now the Undead Fleet has ordered him to abandon the ship! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you include this ship, Admiral? Do we really have to give up so many warships, so there is no way to retreat."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chen Zifang asked loudly. His voice was hoarse because he hadn’t spoken to people for too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can actually understand this order, but he can’t accept it. The normal life of a warship is about twenty years; most of the battleships of the Resurrection Elf Empire are captured in battle, and they will be affected by the decaying effect. Even if they can use the magic to endure the decay, they will not last for fifteen years. - Some parts will be shorter due to the side effects of decaying magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no oak in the wilderness of the Sanctuary and the Empire. These decaying warships cannot be properly repaired, and ultimately the fate of demolishing or sinking. Only a few of the best ships can only be favored by the undead empire's necromancer, converted into a ghost ship that can exist forever, and that few ships are the flagship of the fleet's sub-fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Failure? It’s hard to get such a big fleet, how can we think about what else failed! This battle was planned by an immortal. Take the city and you can have your own death servant!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich’s official voice is full of energy, and the green light in the empty eyes flashes more than. The death deeds on the ship hurriedly made a sense of being clap their hands. These people are not controlled by the Guardian, or by the Commander of the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chen Zifang also put a smile on his face, and secretly recorded the speech of the police officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has heard the rumors of the immortal. In the rumor, the immortals headed by the Emperor Klein seem to be the same as ordinary people, but the whole body is made of solidified magic, not old. The immortal standing at the apex of all the undead corps did exist, and there is one in this fleet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the time of parking in the phase port is not long, Chen Zifang also heard the true strongest of the phase port: a silver dragon. In order to deal with the silver dragon, the undead empire even put the immortal into the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but how can I send this message to the Free Army? Chen Zifang couldn't think of a way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raining at sea for too long, eating the worst food day and night, the mind seems to be no longer functioning, relying on the fear of death to support itself . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Left full rudder! Beach!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ordered his first officer and helmsman Then close your eyes. The process of rushing to the beach seems so long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the hull hit the beach heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light on the nearby lighthouse has changed color, first from white to golden yellow, and then to stunning red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the clocks in the phase port rang and told the owner of the city that the enemy had come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless crickets and zombies rushed out of the lower deck and rushed to the coast to kill every moving thing they saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the invasion begins, it is responsible for defending the phase port The Namen Soleton Warlord is in the process of making the army in the West Bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alert? Top level alert? Is this something broken?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it’s harsh When the alarm bell rang through his overseers, the first reaction of Major Sorley was like this. The Elf Embassy has about a thousand maids for summoning maids, and they all sound together now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ran into the command room in two steps and there was a set of phase port maps left by the elf ambassador, which was transformed into a mage by the seamasters. The alarm magic device. The map is flat on the table, with thirty-six fuchsia gems embedded in it, and now more than half of the gems emit dangerous red light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reporting situation, Lin Corps."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the majority of the guards in the mansion, Now she is also a blonde former female slave. Since she has already recognized some words, she has made rapid progress in military training. She was promoted to the first ladies of the sea divisions by Naimen and Cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female corporal grabbed the typo-filled recording paper in a panic and reported the situation one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first alert was brought in twenty-five minutes ago, and someone used a large-scale knot... knot..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enchanted Magic?" Seeing the female corporal encountering new words, the door is silently reminded. He had long felt that the sunset color was not right, but at that time he did not wake up and it was the first sound of a large-scale attack. The young warlord made only a lot of reading, and he saw only a lot of magic on paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, yes. The magic covers the phase port and the nearby waters. Fifteen minutes ago, the Westport Lighthouse and the Bridge Defence Forces sent alarms, unidentified enemies. The army began to land, mainly undead creatures. Colonel Cliff made a preliminary judgment, the total number of enemy troops is likely to exceed 20,000, he has begun to assemble all the troops on the east bank, please gather the troops of Westport and join him. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two to three thousand troops, say not much, say a lot less. Direct soldiers are divided into two ways, it seems very familiar with the terrain." The door frowned, and the finger took the route on the flashing map. Unlike the battle at Murrayman, you can't expect the undead army to know nothing about his configuration. “What if I am an attacker?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has little knowledge of the undead. The last time the Free Nations of the United States fought against the undead army was more than a decade ago, and the door to the door knew nothing; but the act of the undead spies in the last year of the Lonnie coup was heard. If that is the way the undead army used to fight...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lin Corps! Inform all the troops in Westport to retreat, retreat to the port, the west side of the phase bridge, the bridgehead, or the big The sacred church... Well, go to the Orthodox Church, don't come here! Let Captain Garnier gather all the guards in the house, and we will evacuate immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"What are you doing here?" Resist the door and walked out of the warning room. "All servants, guards, and guests must join the team. They will gather in the yard within three minutes. When they walk, they will inform the major families and companies in the West Port, and let them put The private soldiers have come out, but this time the attack is undead, don't have any luck, if we can't win, we all have to become a sergeant!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Captain Garnier, the French magistrate, fought side by side with Ronnie and was responsible for training the reserve forces of the sea divisions. The team of more than 200 people gathered from the big house in just three minutes, which fully proved that he still has a good training ability in addition to frivolity. The maids and housekeepers in the mansion, the guests who stayed in the governor's office, and their entourage also had a hundred people. They had not yet assembled, and the chickens and dogs were running outside from the mansion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't wait, Garnier. If you don't leave, you won't be able to go." Nami's eyebrows are almost tied, "Don't bring your luggage, Bring the weapons with light weapons! The enemy has been landing for a long time. If they still have infiltration troops, they may come soon..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just like echoing the prediction of the door Similarly, several fireball magic hit the warlord's watch tower near the wall, lit the wooden tower, and detonated the small box of gunpowder stored on it. The guards who stood on the watchtower, like paper, flew down with the explosion of the gunpowder barrel and slammed into the assembly area of ​​the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is getting worse. His right hand is raised, but he is not trying to save the bombed soldier, but a wind blade magic direct The poor guard - or the body of the guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The watchtower’s body was actually blasted by the door-to-door blast, bursting with brown dust and flying all over the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these smokes fall into the crowd, at least a dozen people will become dead bodies; the bodies will be destroyed, except for a few of the army’s mages and pastors. The guard camp of the gate is afraid that it will be destroyed by the whole army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mage, Barrier! Pastor, Purify!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the order of the door is in place, The three army mages and two chaplains kept the crowd in time to protect the crowd. The girls screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five-section corpse explosion? Or is it a seven-segment corpse infection?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asked by the army mage, he was sprayed back by Captain Ganier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry about this! Since there are more than five enemies, it's ready to meet the enemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not worry so much." Nike shook his head. "The opposite side should just want to delay our steps. It is likely to use a scroll. If you really have the ability to kill us, they will definitely choose to be outside." Fight on the street instead of using such high-level magic to attack. As planned, don't leave the team!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorryton, we want Where to go?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We need an emergency staff, to understand the undead...to renovate the cathedral!” The door tightens the pistol and puts it on The red military uniform with one sleeve, "To let the enemy know, we may be the softest persimmon in the phase port, and it is not so good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His first Rushing out the door of the overseer. On the other side of the street, you can already see the fastest advance troops among the undead army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone, follow me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, as expected, use fireball Enemies with corpse explosions did not meet them outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a low-pitched "squeaky" cry. Looking at the door, I saw dozens of dark green spots, squatting at the end of the street, like the eyes of a wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a corpse dog!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately recognized these threats. The speed of ordinary undead creatures is very slow, and the corpse dog is one of the few that is known for its speed. Not as easy to expose as other undead creatures, as long as there is a big box, you can hide more than a dozen corpse dogs, which is extremely suitable for raids and assassinations. Even the prince of the empire died under the bite of a corpse dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jumper, use the holy water bomb! Garnier, you command the detachment, I open the way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mad cockerel screamed and ran along the stone road The door to the company. More than a dozen tall throwers stopped in front of the non-combatants and threw a holy sailor to the dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holy otter blasted on the slate and poured it on the corpse dog, melting their rotten flesh like a strong acid. The extra holy water lingers on the slate floor. When the dogs step on it, they scream, and the four hooves slide, rolling in the shallow pool, and they won't move after two rounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civilians and girls who have not seen this scene screamed, and several young ladies fainted. The door looked impatiently at the crowd behind him, and screamed: "Put the person who can't keep up with the action on the carriage! The guard is tight, and it is safe to go to the Great Hall of the Innovation Society!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t say more, turned over the horse, with more than 30 equally skilled cavalry marching towards the intersection without the zombie. The Great Hall of the Reform Society is closer to the enemy's front line in the southeast of his governor's office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After discovering that the main force is the corpse explosion magic and the corpse dog, the door is more and more determined that the enemy's main force has not yet arrived. He decided to form his own headquarters before being caught up by the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streets of the south have been able to see the smoke of fire, and many residential areas have spontaneously piled up barricades. The people who were not sheltered gasped and ran wildly without flies. Naimen assigned several commanders of the big squad, and shouted as he marched: "Go to the north in refuge! The enemy comes from the south, refuge to the north! Building a barricade!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time, I can see the savage corpse running in the streets and lanes, tearing the civilians who are caught off guard. The door is biting and biting the lower lip, hardening the heart, knowing that it is not time to save them. If you encounter a person who has been bitten by a dog on the avenue, the door that is not long will be ordered to stun and throw it to the chaplain on the carriage to save his life. If he has begun to lose his mind, he will directly squat his head. If there are civilians who want to take refuge with the army, the door is not accepted, but they are ordered to flee to the north, and a group of quite powerful forces should be organized near the exchange. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After cutting off more than 20 heads and destroying a few zombie squads, Namimen finally looked at the spire of the Great Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like all the clocks, the bell of the Great Hall is also madly screaming, and it also emits a sacred white light that dispels the night that is coming. In the white light, a beam of bright light is also scattered, projected on the huge fountain square in front of the Great Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fountain in front of the church is also being fully sprayed - the door is never known, and the fountain can still be used as a weapon. A whole group of singers composed of young girls stood behind the fountain and sang high songs. Several bishops stood in front of them in the robes of Phnom Penh, and manipulated the fountain full of holy water to sway in the song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the Fountain Square, it was dense, with no eyes on it, several layers of corpses, and a charge behind the corpse. Undead Legion. There are artillery support behind the Undead Corps. From time to time, some shells are fired at the church, but the defensive magic can always catch up and change the direction of the shell into the fountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of church knights who are concentrating on the battle are fighting in the center of the square to form a front line, and the undead army that flocked in from several southern intersections will be blocked. Outside the church. The Musketeers stood in a dozen rows on the steps of the main church. They were mixed with a large number of magicians and pastors. The colors were different from each other. They should be volunteers from the Innovation Society and private soldiers from all major families. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front of the battle was fierce, and the door was not rushing to break through, but the enemy did not find it, and sorted out the team outside the square. Half of the cavalry rushed back to pick up the rear horsemen and infantry, repelled the chasing force, and executed civilians and soldiers infected by the undead army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a loss?" Rebellion retraced for a while and found Captain Ganier who caught the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Twenty-four people were bitten by dogs or infected by zombies. The priest said that eleven were not saved, and those who could not save were burned. I am stunned by the rescue, let the priests of the Reform Society come to rule.” Ganier looked at the cathedral. “Just the battle is so fierce, the carriage and the civilians are afraid that they can’t get in...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where they stood, it happened to be the investment of His Royal Highness Princess Olia Hugh Coleman, and the street in front of the coffee shop where Bai Ruisi was working part time during the day. The coffee shop has closed the door, the porcelain cups and glassware are smashed a lot, and there are a few bloodstains and many zombies dead in front of the store. The street is facing the side of the square. It is the battle line between the two armies. It can be seen that the zombie army is attacking from the south line to the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The avant-garde is a zombie, the defender is a skeleton, the lack of cavalry... Ah, there are still archers and archers. There are not many firearms, and the efficiency of shooting with zombies is very low. The commando has a lot of things like vampires and death knights." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if the efficiency is very low, but it is very disadvantageous with zombies and squatting." The doorkeeper pressed his finger to his ear. "We have cavalry, innovation will have Master, priest and singer, I will secretly contact you first. Garnier, you organize good infantry and civilians. As we rushed over, we rushed into the cathedral."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; After the exchange of the encrypted communication magic with the person in charge of the Innovation Society, the door pulls out "benevolent" in hand. Most of the people present have never seen this sword, and they have held their breath and lowered their voices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that killing the 'benevolent' seized by the Empire Grand Aristocrat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it almost killed Zhang Futu in the Taoist country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was looked at the team and sang the mantra of the bodyguard. Less than sixty cavalry spontaneously lined up behind him in three rows, facing the flank of the undead army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The cavalry is going forward, the infantry is keeping up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go forward!" "Go forward!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teams repeated their orders. The horseshoe smashed on the stone road and gradually got faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get to the square right away, accelerate, break through!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the cavalry enters the square The singer’s voice is as sudden as a big deal. Several male and female bishops standing at the top of the church steps sang the holy words at the same time and threw out the holy emblem in their hands. The sacred emblem popped in the air with the rhythm of the hymn, and some turned into invisible breastplates, stirrups and helmets on the door, and some blew a path in the battle of the undead army. The white light on the bell tower no longer radiates to all sides, but instead turns into a concentrated searchlight beam that guides the front of the horses of their cavalry detachment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the place of the white light beam shines, the weak scorpions, ghosts, and zombies in the undead army are dying out, powerful friends of the undead, vampires, and death. The Cavaliers also became slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is controlled by the left hand with the left hand, and the "benevolent" of the right hand is slanting forward, so that the sixty cavalrymen with the blessing of magic are straight. Step into the big undead creatures who don’t know if there are a thousand or two thousand people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods, sir, this is the result of your contact?! When I was a cavalry assault in my life, I was not so happy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't talk, don't care!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door replied with a sigh of relief, focusing on the eyes Among the enemies, I heard the sound of numerous broken bones in front of the horseshoe. All are mixed soldiers, miscellaneous soldiers, miscellaneous soldiers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy is not stupid, take such a force to attack the Great Hall of the Reform Society, isn't it a death? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Right to the right!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door shouted, swaying to the right, "Benevolence" turned from the right front to the right and pointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Swing right!" "Swing right!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team is not as neat as it was. . Even with such magical support, there are still staff reductions; some people do not know why they suddenly fell off, and some people are directly smashed by the upper undead creatures mixed in the zombie team. There are also a few black shadows trying to pounce on the air from the air, but the "benevolent" that is lifted up is easily made into two sections, which are turned into black fly ash in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were more than forty cavalry detachments stepping over from the bow and rifle, and slammed into a death knight commando that was preparing for the assault. Go straight to the artillery team that has just entered the vampire and the death servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singer is even louder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door can even see the living people in the enemy army start to panic and prepare to escape; this is a reaction that will never be seen in the next undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sound that was as ugly as rubbing with nails on the glass suddenly sounded in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While hearing this voice, Nana immediately felt an impulsive impulse and headache, which made his body stiffer and he wanted to throw away the weapon in his hand. Roll down the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you kill you, this won half of it? It’s not that difficult to be famous."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't think about it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is taking a breath, using the rest of the bite to break the tip of the tongue, the pain is along the nerves Straight to the brain, temporarily resisting the control of the unidentified force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How about using violence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of glass friction turned into a tear The hoarse voice of the cloth is even more unbearable, and the pain in the brain is like a bug crawling in. The door was suddenly black in front of him, and a huge black shadow flew straight ahead of him, hitting his magical protection. The magical protection was instantly broken, and the horse's head of his mount was also cut off. The black shadow hit the horse's head and hit him on the chest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Major!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost the entire cavalry screamed. The hit was so smashing that the door was taken with his own mount's head and was immediately hit and flew up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the door slammed into a large zombie, with a huge impact, smashing those things into a large piece of flesh and blood. The protective magic is still in effect. These flesh and blood are stained outside the invisible shield, covering all of his vision. He looks like a human blood clot rolling in the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that time seems to be slowing down. If there is no protective magic, I am afraid that the ribs are all broken... How many more ribs may be broken together? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white light of the clock tower has been chasing him, adding strength to his protective magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't kill you this way? Yeah, then use you to be a flesh and blood... oh? There is also the will to resist? You only have this Point magic - "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is broken and bites off the tip of the tongue, raises the left hand, wipes the invisible protective magic cover in front of the eyes, and puts the flesh of the zombie Wipe clean. The white light on the bell tower shot directly at him, almost blindfolded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A devotee...maybe there is a lich? Two top casters, probably the consul and the police officer? This squad won't There are more people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the Holy Light who is supporting him! Truncating the white light!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The horror shadow that had just knocked down Malay’s door was quickly rushed to the door. Resist the door and narrow his eyes, the corners of his eyes rushed to his own cavalry and rushed into the enemy's artillery positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, to cover this light, I can't resist mental control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; His lips move slightly and say in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know it. It’s hard to do the bait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another clear voice in the door The sound of the mind directly interrupted the sound of the glass friction. If the devil can make an expression, its present expression must be awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is seen, a burning white light - this description is very strange, but it is indeed a white light that burns through the night - traversing The sky, staying in a dark corner of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white light then shrinks, condenses, blasts, turns into fireworks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clearly heard the cracking of the glass in his mind, trying to control the burning and pain of his nerves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But another shadow of the green light on the eyes came to the door of the door. The huge dark magic contained in the opposite palm is probably enough to crush half of the company. Since all the magic was weakened by the continually shining white light, the Lich Guardian decided to kill him with contact magic and avenge the slain demon lord who had just sacrificed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blessings of the blessings of the region--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door can still hear the big words of the lich. But just as he listened to this big story, the shadow had already been blown out by this white light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like being kicked out and flying out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Impossible, this is not a blessing magic-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white light has turned into A glowing human figure, the volley catches up with the lich, and kicks out with a volley! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This foot goes down, the shining figure with white light also follows; the lich who is kicked is broken into countless spots! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich was dead, and the black enchantment that shrouded the sunset disappeared instantly—although everyone in the room didn’t feel it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is only one light source in the entire square, it is the woman of the white light on the bell tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, the body of the devil is the brain worm, the body of the lich is a life-threatening, I am afraid that it is in the wilderness, can not ridd the roots."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman shook her head and said with a little pity, the hand slammed, the white light on her body burst open, sweeping away the weak undead around. Let the powerful undead creatures squash on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop Bonnie Sefer!" "The original Archbishop is here too!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The door that was lying on the ground coughed fiercely. After losing the defensive magic shield, the flesh and blood of those zombies fell from the air and covered him with a face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He coughed and waved his hand at Bonnie: "Bonnie, please, pull me. No defense magic, cough, cough , good, sore..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On his chest, he still stuck his horse's head. Bonnie came over in the flesh and rot of the land, and solved several vampires and death knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I obviously still help you maintain defensive magic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonnie picked up the horse's head and threw it aside. She grabbed the hand of the door and helped him stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door only felt that the bones of the whole body had to be broken, and they could not stand on the shoulders of Bonnie until they could stand. The chief bishop did not escape, but looked at his dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see, this one-sleeved red uniform that your sister left for you is not stained with blood, just like the new one! It is said that there is no protective magic. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your defensive magic clearly protects the military uniform! Do you consider the owner of the military uniform!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen turned his eyes and coughed a few times: "Bonnie, I want the staff to be ready? Should the power gathered here be enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Actually, I knew this offense during the day. It was told by the empire's prophetic magician. I just didn't expect them to attack so fast."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much power do they have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think there should be at least three groups of governors and guardians "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are two groups of such enemies?!" The door was sucked and breathed a sigh of relief. "So powerful?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In the absence of three such forces, the offensive phase port is dying. We have a silver dragon.” Bonnie helped Naomi to find an unarmed horse and put him on the horse. “If it is me. I will not launch this attack at all. To be honest, until now, I don’t understand why they must launch an offensive?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two times, it still hurts to fall directly on the horse. There is no place in the plexus, muscles and bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been treated for a long time. Now it is the aftermath of your invasion of the demon. It is good to endure it." Bonnie shook his head. "Of course it takes a reason. For us, the ghost fleet and the undead of the Restoration Empire. The Legion is a huge heart disease. However, it is not so much a military threat as they are natural disasters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Natural disasters...?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is frowning, enduring severe pain, thinking about Bonnie’s strange description. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They clearly have such a powerful force that they can control the human mind through the devil, and can turn the deceased into their own soldiers! Fighting with them is better than Fighting with the empire is much more tense... oh... how can you say that it is not a military threat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not that we can hit our conquerors On the horseback, it is a military threat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie simply pulls the stable and stops at the center of the battlefield with Naimen. She opened the finger of the door and froze, carefully pulled out the "kindness" and inserted it back into the enchanted scabbard at the waist of the door. Seeing that the door was squatting on the horse like a corpse, Bonnie smiled and raised her hand and poked it into the collar of the door with the "kindness" in the scabbard, so that he could stand up and let him sit up. On the horse. In the eyes of the various forces in the distance, it is like Bonnie is holding a horse for the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, the Eastern powers that are born again from death are a non-discretable force on paper. There is only one small problem: undead It cannot be increased naturally. Free nations and empires can gather a huge army to fight each other every 20 years, but the Restoration Empire cannot decide to do this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door-to-door, like the Scarecrow, began to grasp the thoughts of Bonnie: "That is, if they can't roll the snowballs of the undead, they are losing money?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie looked at the door that stood upright immediately, and answered and arranged the uniform of the military uniform for him: "Yes. You defeated Zhang Futu, and the whole country surrendered. For the undead empire. There is no such good thing. They can't exchange more than the uneconomical battle, and it's hard to take the enemy's power for their own use. Now these guys are estimated to withdraw to kill and replenish their troops, but the entire phase of the port is alert, they can How many people are killed?"<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "No wonder we have repeatedly defeated the undead imperial army with magical superiority and superiority in history."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. When the undead soldiers can get one to two, three or even five exchange ratios, the undead army seems unstoppable; but when this army hits the defensive power of the civilized country, it The power of the sun will melt like the snow in the sun. The lower undead creatures don’t even have the intelligence to retreat. At the end of each invasion, they face the Koman Army, the Murrayman Army or the Eastern Imperial Army. The autumn wind sweeps the fallen leaves...just like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door looked at the battlefield and nodded slightly, agreeing with Bonnie’s statement. The blood sea and bones at the foot are a few feet thick. I don't know how many undead troops died in this square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is more need for annihilation than any other force. Only the annihilation of war can save the power of the undead. Once it is wage war, it means that the precious upper undead creatures are forced to exchange with the cheaper magistrates of the Imperial Army or the Free Army. Whether it is a vampire or a friend of the undead, it is difficult to resist the constant supply of church and wizard associations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder the undead empire will never be the glory of the year..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" They are not stupid. So, I am still thinking about this most critical issue. Why are they attacking here? Here is the phase port! If I am the commander of the undead, I will never leave the big fleet that I can’t easily get. Here! There must be something I didn't think about..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! There is an immortal!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice suddenly came from under the corpse not far from the two, and Bonnie was taken a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still a living... are you a servant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Chen Zifang, the captain of the Seventh Fleet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
