Now it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here Under the flag, Jiawen Alvarez put down the telescope and extended his hand to the half-elf adjutant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morning dew is a savory liqueur made by Sansen, which is naturally fermented with vine berries from the original depths of Western Sanctuary. Its quality is so good that it can be used as a catalyst for many magic. Many Sage Mori like to bring two bottles for use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the half-elves did not execute this command immediately. He hesitated to look at his bloody elf chief and asked: "I care for the elderly, do you think it is time to drink?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Remember to have it. Take it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf looked up and stared blankly at the women’s guards who had lost some calm and grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiawen’s cheeks are pale white, and the perfect silky satin-like skin is flooded with water. The sweat beads seem to emit a shimmer, and it seems to reflect the light of the sun, quite conspicuous. No matter how hot the weather is, few people can see the pure blood elf sweating. Many people even guess that the pure blood elves have no ability to sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adjutant did not dare to disobey and took a bottle from his backpack. The touch of ice magic is on the surface of the bottle and a layer of hoarfrost is formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiawen Alvarez grabbed the bottle of morning dew, the right hand pointed the knife, straightened off the bottle, the whole bottle of lavender Pour it on your body and pour it from under the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold lavender morning dew hits Jia Wen’s face, soaking the upper body of her green shawl, as if it were a bloody mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is much more comfortable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female Guardian ignores the surprise of the people around him Taking a deep breath, he raised his hand and lifted the bottle, and forced the enemy to march toward the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a powerful, crystal-shaped dark blue diamond-shaped bottle that draws a parabola-like parabola in the air and disappears into the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked in the direction of the parabola of the bottle and could see that one team after another was hesitant to put on the red flag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some camps change faster, some change slowly, but the whole trend is very obvious: those camps that are farther north than their elf mercenaries have already I started to change the red flag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The order is passed." Jia Wen licked her head and took off some of the wine on her long blond hair. "Blast the cannon and prepare to go northwest." Attack!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Attack to the Northwest?” The adjutant around her repeated dull, “Northwest?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Northwest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first reaction came from the Deputy Commander of Ma Junji, who was stationed in Senhuwei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General Lei! Ma’s deputy commander Ming Ming has an order to keep the ministry here, to resist the rebels, and the reinforcements will arrive soon! Never retire at this moment. Ah, if you block the rebels, it is possible for the Master to give you three times, no, five times, ten times the reward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘉雯Alvarez took a deep breath and the expression on the pretty face was very cold. Deep pink wine stained on her whitish long blond hair, slightly like blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strategy of seeing the temptation of heavy money is not feasible. The ambassador of the garrison immediately changed his face and persuaded him: "Please also ask General Lei to think twice! Now the battle line between our army and the thief army and the rebels is like the teeth of a dog. Cross, if Sen Huwei is acting arbitrarily, it may be destroyed by the two armies! The rear camps don’t know if your army has received a higher price and played a red flag...”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words implied threats have changed the face of the half-elf adjutant: "Does he think that the female guardian of Sansen can be intimidated?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the elf guardian has not changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just walked quickly to the supervisor and tightened her right fist. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before everyone on the scene had time to react, Jiawen Alvarez repeatedly put his fist on the face of the Taoist army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of this punch is far greater than it looks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for the guards around the garrison to react, and the blood that broke out from his ears turned into two blood swords, straight into the two throat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General Thunder..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people looked at the woman of the Alvarez family in amazement Protect the officer, and the net of blood around her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a veritable blood network. The blood of the three deceased people are connected together, flying around Jiawen, mixed with the wine that she had poured on her body, giving off an indescribable aroma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before everyone on the podium got into chaos, Jia Wen first stabilized everyone. As soon as she raised her hand, the flying blood stopped and turned into a red cloak behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't panic. This is just the bloodline magic of the New World. You know who my father is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence sounds calm and gentle, and immediately calms down the officers of the Elf mercenary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you don't have to panic, the guardian's father, Lei Lituo, conquered the Xinzhou Nanban Elf using blood magic! It's just like arcane, You don't have to panic like ordinary magic like a Taoist!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After someone explained it to her local officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although even their own suspicions: If this magic is really just ordinary magic like Jiawen Alvarez, why she Never used in previous battles? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The battle has arrived here. Obviously, the Guards have lost in the West Bank. They may also have the opportunity to fight back, but we are blocking the front of the Free Army. There is no such opportunity. Therefore, we will withdraw from this position, but we must not escape from this position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiawen’s pure blood elf’s accent sounds and Not high, not moving, but her hair and mouth adorned with those who do not know whether it is blood or wine makes her speech look very deterrent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy will definitely try to attack us from the flanks, so be sure to keep the battle queue all the time. If the other party tries to attack this way, I will let them regret it. The troops blew up heavy artillery, took up a minimum of gunpowder and supplies, and prepared to retreat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that after the break with the employer’s representative, the entire elf mercenary The fate has reached the end of life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Senhu Wei’s flag burned and the explosion of the bombardment rang. These huge movements have ended all the operations of both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice reached the joint army striker position that was preparing to attack the Elf Army, allowing the two commanders of the army to hold the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are going to run?" Nami Soleton looked at the fire in the enemy camp and asked, "Then we have to plan." Launching an attack?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi raised his delicate chin and frowned, hesitating: "If this army is not an elf mercenary, then we do wait He left the best..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But that is a mercenary. It is the most stubborn mercenary who escaped from the state. If we ignore it, they will probably burn and rob and kill, causing great damage. Other state soldiers as long as we control The Green Cattle House will not cause too much damage to the place, but this army is different. Since we have to take charge of the Green Cattle House, we cannot leave them so intact."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Zhang Shiyi looked at the door with the eyes of the request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If possible, I hope that our two armies will defeat them together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just chasing words "Okay." Resist the door and hesitated. "But that is the elf army after all, and it may cost a lot. Let our best troops try it first."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then let my people come first." Zhang Shiyi pulled out "kindness". "It seems that I have to borrow more time for this sword."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door nodded noddedly: "I don't know how to use swords, of course, it should be better for you. I will carry your reserve with the gendarmerie. The joints of Zhuhai and the Lancers are wound from the right wing. Pass the enemy, continue northward along the Ruoshui River, but if they refuse to change the flag, they will break them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the command is passed, the joint army's cavalry points As two stocks, one continues to sweep forward along the river, while the other one points directly to the elf mercenary who is retreating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the two hundred pioneers cavalry led by Zhang Shiyi and the elf mercenaries in the column retreat, the bloody elf woman with arms wrapped in blood . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that the Alvarez Guardian of the State of Goa?! She actually broke down?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen and Zhang Shiyi have a relationship with Jiawen Alvarez. In the Battle of Gou, they all saw the posture of the female commander in the telescope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now she looks...very different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiawen Alvarez rides a mane with a faint golden light of the heavenly bloody white horse, looks like a demon from hell, she The standard and calm elf accent sounds as if it is malicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The big lady of Hengqu, I admit that you won again this time. But I don't want to lose either. Sansen's guardian can't go back with failure. I will change my place to lay down my work, as long as you don't pursue it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiawen raised a short knife with his right hand, blooded Zhang Shiyi is not like a defeated army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taimen and Zhang Shiyi looked at each other and exchanged their surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that Senhu's Taoist Magic, Resist the Door?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And me The known Sansen arcade and the magic are somewhat different. Please ask Miss Zhang to wait a moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is stretched out and holds the piece A blue gem with the memory of Anne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you recognize the woman's magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the blood sacrifice magic, Nanxin The magic system of the continent. The blood sacrifice magic is a magical magic that is almost lost. Modern people have rarely used it..." The memory library said in a less certain tone. "The scholars who study it say that the power is great, and the more people kill. The greater the power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid that the Alvarez family has seized the skills in Nanxinzhou. He passed the magic to the family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After getting the answer, the goalkeeper relayed it to Zhang Shiyi. He looked at the Elf mercenary who had alternately covered the three teams behind Jia Wen, and his heart was alarming. "I think it is better for us to reach an agreement with her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"But...in this chaos, the elf mercenary can still completely retreat. If you don't want to destroy it today, don't know how much it will cost in the future! They have Al Some people like Vales are commanders, and there are nobles of the state as officers. In the whole country, there is no state that can guarantee in front of them. Others may not, and my guards can break through her. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the big lady of the cross-ditch was still in a psychological struggle, he controlled the horse close to her side, violently reaching out to hold her right hand holding the sword, and whispering close to her ear: "Don't be impulsive! You and me are not Familiar with the opposite magic, but she is likely to be familiar with us. If you or I die here, what will happen to the whole country? First, capture the Green Cattle, and the future things can be said later!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Zhang’s hand was held down by him, and the body trembled and his eyes were clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry... I am impulsive. I really shouldn’t think too far."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She shook her head hard, as if she wanted to expel what was in her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, she solved the "benevolent" and returned it to the door, while answering the opposite female elf:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't decide on this matter. The entire Allied Forces and the Allied Forces of the Cross-Army are listening to the command of General Nanny Soleton, and you should ask for his kindness!" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was accidentally taken over by the sword. He wanted to quit, but he also knew that it was not the time to discuss these issues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite Jiawen Alvarez looked at him with some surprise and asked: "Are you a man who can be the master, the general of the phase port?" What are your conditions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is half a horse forward, Shen Sheng: "Although we are two enemy, but now I You don't need to annihilate you here. As long as you guarantee that there will be no indiscriminate killing and looting on the road, we can even order the states and counties that are willing to cooperate with Zhang's branch to provide you with support. But if you try to turn the place you have turned into a scorched earth. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice has increased dramatically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if you pursue the Sansen, you have to pay for the Alvarez family!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It is more like the ruler of this country than Zhang Futu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiawen chuckled in moderation, but that gently The sharp laughter is very penetrating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know if you are, or are those people in the phase port want this country? The lady next to him, I hope you want to be clear, this man Behind the southern powers, you may not be as you think!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Zhang Shiyi said coldly: "Your country has invaded my fruit for so many years, but in the end Such a result will not bother you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sangsen’s female sergeant smirked, shook his head, and finally voted for Nanimen’s eyes. It seems that I want to write down his looks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you really want to win the country... I want to accomplish this kind of work with a human body, I think we probably have no chance to meet again. Now, the magic in your arms is very interesting, but unfortunately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaving such a sentence, Jiawen Alvarez dialed the horse The military array is still rigorous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door shook his head and dispelled the uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Leave a team of cavalry to monitor them, Miss Zhang."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand." Zhang Shiyi replied, holding his hand, "Don't care about the provocation of the defeated army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joint army moved again, along the west bank of the Ruo River To the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forward cavalry drives the squadron, just as the wolves chase the flock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of them, apart from the Chinese army of Ma Jun, there is no other army that can be listed as a battlefield like the Elf Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗣师大人!河西左翼诸Camp, all are reversed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the big account, almost all the military camps have become a mess, including the battalion of Zhang Futu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the south of the flag of Ma Jun, the yellow flags have fallen, and the red-red flag has risen one by one. Even if there are no red flag troops, most of them have already collapsed, no longer obeying the command of the banner of Yanshi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awful news came one after another. The failures of the past few days were superimposed, spread along the magic net, the bonfire and the banner, and ran over one team after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Elf Mercenaries have been reversed! They have left the fortification artillery position and fled!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Please ask the adults to go to the East Coast quickly, we will swear to delay the time here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The traitor is big, but also ask the Master to go to the East Coast After the whole revenge for us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Daoguo Wenwu, headed by Jia Lin Deng, smashed the ground, only Zhang Futu stood in the middle of the big account, his face was black, people I feel that he seems to fall down at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it all over?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice echoed in the big account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The whole west of the water, is it all right? What is the flag of Ma Zhenglu?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp No one dares to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire right wing of the Weishui River West Coast Guardian Army originally had a total of 78,000 troops in the four provinces of Haixi, Haidong, Fuxi and Yuanfeng, in Zhang Futu After carrying Huang Tianshen Lei Shen Weidu River, it added 8,000 new troops and near-peak troops, totaling more than 80,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never imagined that with such a large army, he could not rush through the seemingly weak military squad of the Red Army - it seems to be more The thief army has tried to counter it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another flag officer rushed into the big account, bringing the latest bad news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sorcerer, the thief, the two thieves, the sergeant, the squadron, the cavalry, and the squadron killed the horse deputy! The military battalion has collapsed, please ask the master to make a decision!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ma Zhengru he also ... cough, cough, cough......!!! ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stunned, Zhang Futu is like a trapped beast and slams up, as if he has pulled up two inches from the air, coughing up violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Suo, Zhang two thieves? This little girl, really looking for a strong support! This road is to see, this What kind of demon girl is the little girl..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Zhang Futu stopped and his eyes began to move, just like what he was reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following people will understand in an instant that there is a communication technique that has just passed into the mind of Zhang Futu with the magic net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Taoist martial arts watched the face of the sorcerer with a trepidation, staring at Zhang Futu’s trembling mouth and fingers-<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face is described in four words, that is, "the wind is coming." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time is not too long, but for the local ministers who are underground, it is as long as a whole day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, when the teacher once again spoke, he said something that surprised everyone in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Establishing the heart for the world. For the sake of the people. For the sake of the sacred school. For the world to open peace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Futu just repeats the four teachings of the opposite side of the channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I don’t know what it means to say these four sentences after the anger, no one dares to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They said so. In their view, I am pushing the East to push the savings, beliefs, and lives of tens of millions of people in recovery. The cause of my ruin is the main cause of my ruin, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Actually, do you think so? The rebel army, do you think so?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one dares to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's stand up! Don't pretend to be squatting! Come with me, go see the heirs of the cross channel! Go see the promise The people who ended the Eastern Expedition!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the resurgence of Zhang Futu, a thunderstorm broke out from nothingness, hit the entire camp, sweeping from the crowd After that, they hit them at their feet, and they all shot a black in front of everyone in the big account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People bounced off the ground like a lightning strike. The Jia Lin lamp is even more pale, and the two battles almost collapsed on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe there are people who have been suspicious that Zhang Futu has been driven by this continuous blow--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Now he has proved that even if he is crazy, he is a madman who is no match. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sergeant who ruled the entire country took the lead out of the camp, followed by a large team of warring generals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of them, is the entire battlefield that is collapsing. After the elves' mercenaries rebelled and the horses were ruined, the various armies had already lost their flags. The entire West Bank battlefield was left with only the new military camps near the rear divisions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sergeant stood on the podium and looked at the red tide-like army howling, running, and collapsing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the middle of those troops, they were two cavalry spurts along the river bank, and several teams of infantry who followed the battle behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His gaze rested on the two rides that were almost squatting in front of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The woman is the heir to the Zhang of the Hengqu." The thin middle-aged man sighed, "The young man beside her is the magic online." The legendary 'Freedom Army's whip'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who dare to speak up: "I want to come."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really full of enthusiasm. Compared to hiding in the Green Bull House. Now think about it, the last time you went to the East, it was five or six years ago."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Futu looked at his skinny hands and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A military commander came out of the crowd and hurriedly said: "If you want to fight back, please hurry up! If you kill the two, you should still Can..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They just know this and sent me the article." Zhang Futu sighed, "If I am fully committed Going and killing the two young people is not difficult. Just, if the Eastern Expedition is not successful, the right way is not clear, even if I kill some of the descendants of the right way, how is it different from death?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the generals will probably guess what kind of article Zhang Futu saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not allowed to give up on yourself -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for Jia Lin Deng to persuade The gaze of Zhang Futu swept over and blocked his words in the eyes of the blind man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The look, it doesn’t look like a person who has already abandoned himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, you are basically opposed to the Eastern Expedition. You all think that the current country is actually very good, so you will stay." Here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Futu seems to have wind and thunder in his eyes, no one dares to justify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, your thoughts are the punishment of my sinful sin. So the soldiers will betray, the yellow flag will fall, this is all The will of the right way. I am trying to draw people who do not agree with my right path. It is my fault."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words sound incoherent, as if they have accepted this time. Failed; but everyone can clearly feel that Zhang Futu has not been killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like the army of the Hengqu! I would rather have 30,000 loyal to the dynasty of the Eastern Expedition, and do not need you guys!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hand, finger pointing to the sky in the east. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I am the Eastern Expedition! The East is me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"willing to go east Come with me! If you don't want to go, stay with them! My right path, you don't need you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The country’s civil and military squandered Only the Jia Lin lights trembled to represent the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That I wish you a great slogan, Jia will not be with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Futu stared at him, looked at the moment, and suddenly laughed freely and ridiculously: "Sure enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing, this generation of Xiongxiong directly stepped on the Ruoshui River, Gone to the east bank barracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to go east, find me by yourself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lost in the West Bank I have such a sentence. At the same time, countless troops are losing their helmets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two hours, Zhang Futu was one of the East Coast Guards, and he left the remnant army straight eastward, completely ignoring the collapse of the West Bank and abandoning it. Most of the troops on the east coast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the rest of the Guardians are aware of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗣师大人逃逃了!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Zhang Futu escaped!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sunset of this day falls, such shouts resound throughout the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Futu has no choice to attack. He didn't even choose to defend. He led the reliable 20,000 people on the east coast of the water to leave the front line, leaving the swinging army to Zhang Shiyi and her Western allies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these shouts, Nami Soleton stood on the hill in the north of Puzhou’s capital city, watching the northeast side immersed in the red sun The land in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the direction of the Green Bull House. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the entire world of the Pacific. Li Er promised to the promised land of the Taoists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is self-talking, it sounds like that No real feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No... it should be said that we have won."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned and walked back to himself In the camp, new and highly anticipated orders were issued in the headquarters of the United Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tonight's feast, heading toward the state... No, go to the Green Bull House!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Puzhou Battle ended here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover the state, the state, the state, is the capital of the Pacific. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There, there should be a red flag inside Zhang’s arrangement in the Hengqu, climbing the city gate of the South Gate of Qingniu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the wall of the government house of Murrayman Eight oriental characters with dragon and phoenix dances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight words are "all evils are done in good deeds", in the eight words from Buddhism, which is a part of the country that believes in peace. Eyes are tied outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were visitors from the republics who asked the owner of the Government House: "What do these eight Oriental characters mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor answered this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the original intention is not the case, it is more appropriate to use this sentence to summarize the Murrayman conquest war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Taiping calendar was 1,438 years, in the spring of 1667, the joint army led by Nami Soleton defeated Zhang Futu in Puzhou. The Weijiajun, opened to the southwestern road of Qingniufu. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remnant of the Zhang Yi division fled to the eastbound province of the province, and boarded the ship to the Tianfu in the capital of Chitou, the right to rule the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time in history that a foreign army has captured the Green Bull House, but it is the most important one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Puzhou Battle is a small battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the deaths and injuries of millions of previous free wars, or the civil wars of the Eastern Empire and the Taiping Road countries with deaths and injuries of tens of millions, this battle resulted in The casualties are not worth mentioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only one who triumphed in the battle was less than 30,000 soldiers. Although the losing party actually invested 115,000 troops in the West Bank battlefield, However, the actual direct death toll is estimated to be no more than 7,000, and the death caused by the collapse will not exceed 10,000. The vast majority of the participants have returned to their hometowns safely, and only the upper organization of the Taiping Road has been replaced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the decisive consequences of this battle are unquestionable, and it must also occupy an independent chapter in the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the change of the Blue Bull House is different from the last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Clade Lopez = Luo Ruide brought only foreign mercenaries, then Nami Soleton = Sonomon,] Wei Taiping = Pis Wein and the war that was launched together brought about the economy and logic of the Western world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army of the Intrarians entered the Green Bull House, and the wealth from the countries of the Taiping Road continued to flow into Interlake, which nourished Lenny. Even Delan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this day on, the control of the middle section of the Liujin route changed hands. The world of Taiping Road precipitated its property for 1,500 years and flowed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the people rolled to the ground, the Taoist deprivation of property, the re-concentration of the land, became a large farm based on new agricultural technology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Murray's cotton field will nourish the textile factory in Intre Bay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of the free nations are not particularly holy or particularly moral, nor do they act to liberate or save anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They, like other nations, have greed and ambition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the nationals of the free nations have a special nationality, it is that these greed, evil and ambitions are even more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tide of ordinary greed and ambition of thousands of mortals, corrodes everything, sweeping the old order of the world of peace, and will continue to move toward civilization The rest of the world and the non-civilized world rushed away —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until the entire old world was overwhelming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The historian of certain schools called this historical event "red tide." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a sea tide made up of countless, malicious, just crazy seaweeds, but where they pass, all oxygen is plundered, Most creatures will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a good act, regardless of any standard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless, innocent people will struggle in the years that followed, speculation, out of the head, die of death, ruin, and the family will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old faith and calm life no longer exist, replaced by intense work and precarious life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
