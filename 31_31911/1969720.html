After they captured the largest city in the Murrayman area, Gammes, they built the capital of the country in accordance with the shape of the Jingzhao government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a religion in the local area that worshipped cattle, which made the monks of the Yellow Dowels overjoyed. After a serious testimony, they believed that the temple of this religion was the only true prophet of the righteous, Li Er, who took his place to stay after the letter. They wrote a book entitled "The Sutra of Laozi" to describe this history. This book became the first Hadith of the new Taiping Taoist country and named the city Qingniu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only regret is that there are no eight waters around the city, only two large rivers. However, the Eastern Empire has been famous for its water control since ancient times. They have channeled from the two large rivers, irrigated the fertile fields around the Qingniu, and integrated all the channels into the city to form the moat of the arched capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Taiping Taoists abandoned the original names of the two rivers. According to the "goodness of the water" in the morals, the river in the east of the city was renamed "Shangshan The river, the big river in the west of the city is renamed as "Ruoshuihe". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Green Cattle House is located in the shortest distance between the two rivers. The area around the two rivers is nearly 30 kilometers square. The fertile land of the plains, the Green Bull House stands in the middle of this alluvial plain, and the satellite city surrounding this giant city stretches to the edge of the Shangshan River and the Ruoshui River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small town on the east bank of the Ruoshui River, Jiawen Alvarez and her "corps" took the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They brought out the wealth from Jiawen Fegner, and it is easy to buy supplies near the rich green cattle house. Looking out from the camp, the wide Ruoshui River is like a big lake, so it is barely able to see the opposite bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Honourable Alvarez, the military ambassador of the Ambassador of the Qingniu, said that the ambassador did not want to see us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Jiawen Humin was in the town to find a place to eat with several middle-level officers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The festival is close to the New Year of the Oriental calendar, and every town around the Green Bull Palace is decorated with lights and a festive atmosphere. Along the Shangshan River and the Ruoshui River, the trade of the entire Taiping State was carried out in these small towns and eventually gathered in the Green Cattle House. The local local people around the city paid attention to the glamorous and glamorous elf woman, and some children deliberately ran around not far away, talking loudly about these foreign soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jia Wen’s ignorance of all this, impatiently waved to the quasi-elf sergeant who came back: “Don’t be so frustrated. The elders who came to be the ambassadors of the Green Bull House are not worth mentioning. The important thing is, have our national books been sent in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, I sent it in. With the help of The name of the embassy was sent in the form of a second-class book..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seeing it with your own eyes?" The female guard interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My follow-up as a military officer, hand-delivered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, good. The Niufu Embassy still has a person who knows the importance.” Jia Wen’s cold expression shook a smile. “Since it has been handed in, our work is finished. Come and have some lunch, this is called’ The pot helmet 'What's something seems to be quite delicious.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following, protect the officer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene of the former Gaolingzhihua Guardian and the closeness of these mixed-blood elves, if they were seen by the people of Honglinasti, would be amazed by the surprise. But Jiawen Alvarez has not cared. For her now, it is more important than anything to stabilize the remaining officers and train them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading such a raging army to the Green Bull House is much more difficult than she expected. Only after losing a well-trained army like the Elf Corps will a commander realize how powerful and convenient such a professional army is. She now regrets that she has not been able to rescue the colonial army from the fiasco of Jiawen Fegner - even if only a complete team of 100 is rescued, it will be much better than the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Anti-Dyborg to Qingniu, it is necessary to pass through the five states of Inzhou, Puzhou, Duzhou, Zhongzhou and Shengzhou. It took the team 12 days to reach the outskirts of Qingniu, and more than one-third of the fugitives along the way. Most of the locals and low-edity elves escaped. The Legion has only three hundred people left. Not only that, the original expected amphibious slamming has completely gone bankrupt; after the anti-Di military joined the lineup of the cross-rebels, the big conqueror Kutuz had to give up the plan to retake Jiawen Fegner and use his fleet. In the vicinity of the blockade, to ensure that the boats of the cross-rebels could not land on the Taiping Peninsula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only three hundred people in all the chips left in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to cling to the rest of the people, Jia Wen also had to release more goodwill - for a pure blood elf, a touch of laughter is already very Great goodwill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is the Guardian, are we waiting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If that Master Zhang Yishi can realize the seriousness of the current situation, he will come to invite us. Even if we are full of rumors here, what will happen in the city of Green Cattle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The officers who wore the helmets agreed to nod. These days, the rumors of the cross-river soldiers have spread throughout the country at a flying speed along the magic network. Everyone has heard these rumors. Even the boss who sells the helmet, I am afraid I have heard the news that "the real old Zhang’s lady is going to fight back!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, the huge anti-Driving army actually surrendered in one day? At the time of Anti-Dyborg, it looked like a decent army. Ah." After eating a few mouthfuls of sauce, the quasi-elf who came back couldn’t help but sigh. When he was in Anti-Diebao, he also went to see the general of the army with Jia Wen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jia Wen squinted and explained: "You must think that General Zhu was surrendered because the vanguard was annihilated, and that would underestimate him. From one At first, he was afraid to surrender with the last resort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you say this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The general Zhu is an extremely valued person. The action he chooses must be... How do you say it in your Taoist language? Both offensive and defensive? Is it right? He is the kind of person who will never give up any chance." In fact, it is very good to estimate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, it seems to be the most combative force to launch a tentative battle, in fact, he thought from the beginning Are you sacrificing these troops and then surrendering and surrendering?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, if the Pioneer wins, it is natural that the troops who are loyal to the division are all rewarded, he sells If the Pioneer wins, he will save his strength; if the Pioneer is defeated, then this is the first great achievement for the new boss. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The result is the third one. He also decisively cast the side of the cross channel... The general Zhu can calculate the benefit to this share, it is really A terrible person." The quasi elf exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they heard the sighs of the soldiers, Jia Wen shook his head: "You are wrong. It is because such people's interests are too fine, they are easy to deal with. When I saw the Zhu Taishou, I knew how he would act and used this to formulate our countermeasures. Those who are really difficult to deal with are another kind--"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she hasn't finished, she hears a violent horseshoe slamming through the silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sorcerer's message! Silently avoiding!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing such shouts, around The Taoists immediately smashed into the ground, and only their pedestrians sat in their seats. Two officers who had already believed in the Taiping Road stood up anxiously and wanted to kneel down, but they were waved by Jia Wen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quasi-elf adjutant on the side could not sit still: "Lord Alvarez, should you be vigilant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should not..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horseback riding team stopped in front of this small tea stall and blocked the road for a while. The people around them came out from home and bowed down to the missionary team of Master Yan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following the life of the Heavenly Taoist priest!" The man came faceless, dressed in a Chinese costume, shouted with a sharp, harsh voice. "Which is St. Senleijiawen Lei protects the officials?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out to be an eunuch." The famous pseudo-elf officer whispered, kicked by the next Taoist officer. foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiawen Alvarez stood up and replied with some arrogant tone: "I am the escort officer appointed by the Elven People and the Senate, Ray Jia Wen. Is there any problem with this adult?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eunuch’s mouth is picking up and seems to want to attack, but he is surrounded by a robe The mouth roared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a regular servant! How can you be so ignorant of the singer?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiawen’s face has not changed, and he has a look that “I don’t understand what you are talking about”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eunuch coughed softly, and the robe immediately calmed down. "You don't have to argue with them. The teacher's morality is important. Dare to ask Lei Daren, are you sending two warning letters with thousands of miles?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Exactly." Jia Wen imitated the Taoist rituals and arched his hands. "I believe that Master Yan has already seen it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Nodded, "Please bring your guard with me, and the teacher wants to see you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiawen raises his hand and signals everyone to stand Get up, "Go to the camp and bring a few horses to come over-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need." The eunuch said again, "You have nine people. Teng nine horses Give them, the teacher is anxious to see them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ordered that there were nine people jumping off the horse behind the guards. The lieutenant told him to return to the station on his own, and then he took the guardian and his party back to Qingniu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really unexpected to chase after my messenger... This is really unexpected.” Jia Wen stepped on the horse and whispered to her side. The companion said, "It seems that this sorcerer can be more difficult to deal with than the Zhu Daren."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think so... "The quasi-elf is obviously biased against the eunuch in front of him. "It is not the behavior of the king to bully the warrior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is in the public The officers caused a whispered echo, and the officers of the two Taoists quickly screamed to everyone. In Sansen, although the pure-blooded elves also have slaves, the level between the different bloodline aristocracy is clear, and there will never be a situation where the slaves are above the Sansen citizens by the influence of the master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this person does not act for the immediate benefit, but for a larger goal. That means his actions are difficult to estimate. Many, everyone, we have to be careful to deal with this Eastern emperor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hours later, near the evening, in the misty rain, they arrived Green Cattle House. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the first time that the Elf Women’s Guardian Officer saw the Green Cattle House. The alluvial plains at the foot are all farmland and canals, and even the smallest hills are not there, stretching to the foot of Qingniu. It can be seen that the huge white city is on the horizon, but it is even bigger in the rain and fog. I am afraid that there are more than ten gates in this city. It is a huge city with the same level as DeLand, Lenny, and Huajing. If there is a hard attack, there must be 100,000 talents who have hope to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards at the gates are extremely nervous. If they are close to the enemy, the leader’s regular service will pass the identity before they are released. Jia Wen noticed that the guards of this city gate were clearly divided into five or six different factions. Several officers who spoke different dialects controlled their own hands and did not communicate with each other. They only screamed when they released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ancient city of the Millennium, the city of Qingniu is more chaotic than imagined. The Murray-style circular, curved buildings and the Taoist temples of the Taiping Road, the monk towers are unplannedly connected to form the streets, the inner lanes and the alleys. The only way to accommodate the knights and carriages is the passage from the gates to the central Taiping Palace. While looking at the number of soldiers and monks on the street, Jia Wen secretly calculated the amazing number in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if there are no 660,000, 100,000 are afraid that they can’t stop it, at least equivalent to twenty corps..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Checked the identity in front of the palace gate, the cavalry guarding the eunuch went to the headquarters, and most of them also ran in different directions, leaving only the regular The aides and two followers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forbidden army guarding the palace gate shouted the sign and slowly opened the huge palace gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“代天——行道——反逆-”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open - Taiping - "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guard's Guards used a prolonged voice to open the door while repeatedly tapping the ground with the handle of a pistol in the hand slogan. The officers behind Jia Wen were shocked by this momentum. Only the gentle-blooded Jia Wen’s face was as usual, and he could still talk to the eunuch around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dare to ask Mr. Chang Shi, where are the teachers of the Master who are going to call us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lord is in Jin Tieguan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once in the Taiping Palace, the voice of the eunuch was not so high and harsh, but was carefully lowered. sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Golden Iron View? Is it the place to cast magic items?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smell the whole Taiping Jia Wen asked casually about the smell of incense and spices fluttering in the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the place to discuss the military affairs." The eunuchs took these curious foreigners around a huge and incomparable hall and Taoist temple. The Jun Palace is a place of sacrifice. The Taiji Temple is the place where the main hall holds the wine festival. The Dan Ding view is the place to study alchemy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, a group of people Stop in front of a gigantic palace that is as strong as the standard of Saint-Sen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sen Sen came to protect the civil official Lei Jiawen, the daughter of Lei Li Tuo has been brought to the Lord to summon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eunuch yelled at the voice. Soon, the answer came from inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗣师大人召雷嘉雯!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need for me and me Is the Guardian laying down the weapon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In front of the Master, there is no need." The eunuch replied proudly, "There is no need to unload the Taiping Palace." Under the weapon. In the Taiping Palace, no one is the enemy of the right path."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope so." Jiawen Alvarez whispered a sneer, I calmed down and breathed, stepping into the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her imagination, I thought I would meet a typical Eastern-style emperor, sitting on the high heavenly chair and commanding others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual teacher she saw surprised her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Jin Tieguan, there is a huge sand table, which is filled with sand to form a map of the seven provinces of the Murrayman State. The mountains and rivers are all over it. A thin, middle-aged man with a deep eye socket and a blue complexion wearing a robe, wearing a bright yellow banded crown, standing next to the sand table, is directing several priests to insert the flag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks very similar to the monks around him, only the headband and the robes on the robes are different. But the unique momentum of the amazing, high-ranking caster will never make people wrong. In the moment of seeing this man, Jia Wen concluded that he must be the sect of the Qing dynasty, and ruled the resurrection of the tens of millions of people in the seven provinces of the Taiping Taoist province. Regardless of his ability to rule, the religious fanaticism that is different from ordinary people will never be wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Zhang Futu’s looks are somewhat morbid, Jiawen will not despise him. Whether it is humans or elves, senior alchemists and alchemists often have some side effects because of long-term trials. This kind of face is called "alchemist face." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She patted the shoulder of the same quasi-elf translation and signaled him to translate his speech simultaneously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The special envoy and guardian appointed by the Sansen People and the Senate, Jiawen Alvarez has seen the Master."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s coming soon, Ms. Lei.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Futu turned and used a deeply sunken eye socket Against Jiawen. The eyes deep in his eyes were like the eyes of an eagle, giving off two points. The general look of the religious fanatics, Jia Wen was only seen in the deputy bishop of the Sun God of Hong Linathi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I heard that the teacher called us, it was natural to arrive immediately without delay. Sorry that the camp was tied to the Ruoshui River and it took some time to come over." Wen Alvarez was a little bit unbearable, and he stepped back a little further and sighed a slap in the skirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not talking about this fast. The fruit-state concession in the twelfth lunar month has fallen, but it has only been sixteen days." Zhang Yi’s sleeves waved and reported several Date, "You have been rushing here from the old Goju State for only 16 days, and there is almost no one day to stop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, 嗣Master of the teacher." Jia Wen was shocked. All the rumors she has heard have said that the Zhang Fu Tu adult is just an avid martyr who has almost no common sense and reason. However, the person in front of the sand table is clearly a person. A tyrant who feels terrified - or a monarch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person does not pay attention to immediate interests. In other words, he did not pay attention to the interests, Jiawen could not judge. Sansen is playing a political game of interest exchange every day, but a person like Zhang Futu is definitely not a good game opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you, Lei Jiawen protects the civil servant, when he leaves my anti-Diebao, he will risk losing the relationship between the two countries. , I sent a letter that my assistants called 'provocation', right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is exactly the case."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Futu slammed into the sand table, and the skinny fingers slammed into the position of Guozhou. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You predicted that Zhu will definitely surrender after more than ten days. Since that war, the red flag of the cross-rebels has already It is full of the provinces of Fuxi and Haidong. Your predictions have been tested."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, Jiawen was able to turn his attention to the sand table. She was horrified to find that the red flag was densely populated in the area west of Qingniu, and many middle areas were interspersed with white flags representing neutrality and suspicious positions. This is not just a sneak attack, it is a civil war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil war is about civil war, the female guardian thinks. She walked two steps forward and walked to the side of the sand table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a prophecy, but the judgment I have seen after the general of Zhu. The person who is too focused on the immediate interests, will be the free army that will be attacked." The combat power was deterred and I thought I could speculate. In the territory of the entire Yellow Turban peace, only me and my army had fought with them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗣The teacher's fingers moved on the sand table, dragging deep marks, and the knuckles made a crisp rubbing sound, which made people feel very painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You only have five hundred people. And these five hundred people have already ran two hundred." Zhang Futu once again pointed out an accurate number of words, that eagle-like look With irony, "Even if you know how to fight with them, do you know how to build an army, Miss Ray?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe I don't know How to build a good army, but you can trust us; our Sansen people and the Senate will never succumb to the turmoil of the Intres. I hope to assist you, respectable Master. You have already I don't know which troops and which cities can be trusted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait for Zhang Fu's gaze to project, Jiawen Alvarez refuted his words in advance . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Zhang Futu paused for a long time, he took back his hand from the sand table and asked, "So, what do you want to come here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally come Then, Jia Wen thought. This is the difference between an advanced caster and an ordinary person: advanced casters always care about what they can do, and ordinary people always care about what they can get from them. Zhu Zhizhi will care about what he wants to do to get the most benefits, and Zhang Futu cares about something much higher than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we win, I want to go back to the state you mentioned, that is, our Jiawen Fegner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She replied categorically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can do what you want, you will be able to choose a new port on the east bank of the Taiping Peninsula. Use this reason to convince What kind of veteran you sent in Dongsanfang, the guy should also do something other than drinking and drinking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Zhang Futu also did not give Jia Wen retorted or bargained the opportunity; this gift is too amazing, Jia Wen did not think about how to bargain for a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The day after tomorrow is the Spring Festival of our lunar calendar. After the festival is over, on the fifth day of the first month, we will send troops down south. Before that, together with your compatriots in Qingniufu , set up an army of at least 1,000 people. The military expenses required can be contacted by our assistants."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Futu with his finger on a Taoist dressed up by a priest Give this task to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then another eunuch led them out of the Taiping Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jia Wen finally relieved and asked a Taoist officer nearby: "Their fifth day of the first month, is our number?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"February 14."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the time the army is ready to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;February 9 cloudy and cloudy<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperial Republic Phase Port<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Buy! United Trading Company 274 pounds per share!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lianmao 277 Sixteen pounds!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Joint Trade 280 pounds sold two thousand shares!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Army debts 82 pounds, buy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" military debts of eighty-four pounds, one thousand, buy!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shouting continues today in the cafe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the establishment of United Bank, the nearby cafes have suddenly increased, increasing at a rate of one to two per day. Countless agents and speculators gathered in these cafés, sipping new beverages that were introduced from Xinzhou and said to be refreshing, reaching the price and the intention of the deal. The pubs that were nearby have changed hands, because no one wants to lose all their chips in their lifetime in the face of drunkenness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each café has its own customer base, small retailers gather in those beverages that are filled with coffee, and agents mostly gather In the second and third floor cafes of the elegant room. As for the real big bookmakers, they can only be found in the few cafes nearest to Union Bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop Ionette Hartman looked up After confirming the target cafe, I signaled the driver to stop the carriage. He took the skirt and walked down the rental carriage, blocked the face with a half-opened folding fan, and looked down at his makeup to avoid the flaws, avoiding the noisy cafe front door and approaching the back door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A questioning voice was heard from the observation window on the back door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionai features a nod and replies with a female voice: "I was invited by Miss Jing. She operated the funds for me."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand." There was a chuckle of female voice, then the snoring of the bolt. The archbishop who was making up the women's dress felt a hot face, but still resisted the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, people like Ionite’s status do not dare to appear publicly near Union Bank. The silver hair and tall figure of the archbishop's shawl are so striking that he has to sneak into the women's clothing to find a trader who works with him. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the big fleet sailed and captured the famous Jiawen Feige, the speculation near Union Bank entered a stage of white-hot. After the joint venture company injected 100% of the stock in this stock, it broke through the 200-pound mark and was rising at a rate visible to the naked eye. The Interlaken Bonds, which have an annual interest rate of three hundred pounds and one hundred gold pounds, have been sold at a 50% discount. After this wave of news, the price went straight over eighty pounds and continued to rise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news spread to all parts of the free country through the new magic communication network, and several association mages who want to earn the influence of the magic net also rushed here, while speculation Stocks and bonds, while researching and publishing a fixed-form magic called "transaction magic", is convenient for everyone to record the transaction on the magic network. Soon, new trading spells were constantly being developed, and the Magical Items and Materials Store also entered the area for magicians and non-magic people to use magic to seek trading opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the Seventh Fleet enters the state of magical silence, raising the hype to a new level: all prices are tens of percentage points above and below the true and false news. The fluctuations in the range finally forced all the big bookmakers who had the inside information to escape from the café in the upstairs of the cafe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, men who come in and out here wear masks, while women wear masks that are often used at masquerades. Silent magic and communication commanded the following agent corps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please cover your face. There are many ordinary people and other large funds at the bottom of the pub. Please do business with us here. Please don't cause them. Attention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The referee who leads the way whispers the Archbishop of Hartman. Ionite was busy covering her face with a folding fan and climbing the stairs on the side door. Under the leadership of the hostess, the bodyguards who crossed the big house went to the fourth floor and knocked on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This room is filled with seven or eight senior agents, each of whom is a magic user who monitors the entire trading area of ​​Magic. Most of the big deals will be intent on the magic net, and then the two sides will complete the transaction through a number of general agents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All agents are busy, no one notices the outsider who just walked in. The hostess led Ionet past them and pushed the door of the back room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two female voices in the room who are talking about it fiercely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still don't understand why these magicians are so keen to study these magic related to bond trading. These magics can't be used for combat, aren't they? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't understand this. The magic net is a very interesting structure. At first glance it seems that only the magic lines are connected to each other, but actually It's not that simple. According to the articles I saw, if you complete a magic and open it on the magic net, then the magic net will lend more power to the magician like a believer who returns it. So there are so many people who are willing to disclose their achievements on the magic net..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that Ionite couldn’t help but insert a sentence: "It is also inaccurate to say this. According to our research, the working principle of the magic net is very different from our magic. You can't understand the magic net as a personified god. You should understand that it is a collection of magician achievements. Tools - not so much God, more like a miracle . Magic flow method or things like "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; at the same time that two women turned his head. One of them is very good for Ionite, and the other is a partner who has dealt with many times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Mr. Ionet Hartman, the ambassador of the Northern Orthodox Church in the Common Diocese of Intres." The Oriental woman opened her mouth to introduce to both sides. "This is my colleague, and I am also loyal to Miss Mei, who is from the Zhangjia family. Like me, she is also one of the treasurers of the Huai Cui line."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that Phase Harbor is one of the largest shops in the region. Similarly, almost everyone who is a little unusual is also aware that Huai Cui Xing is the agent of Zhangjiafu, who was once in the East Port. Now that Ms. Zhang Da has done her best, Huai Cuihang is responsible for the assets of Zhang’s stay in Phase Port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week ago, the Guozhou Anti-District Army admitted that Miss Zhang was the leader of Hengqu Zong. Afterwards, the military and state of the four provinces of Qianlonghai were in a state of change. Even the Fuzhou had many military states hanged with red flags. After that, the reputation of Huai Cui Xing became louder and louder, and it was overwhelmingly overwhelming the pure gold of Bishop Bonnie Seifer. It is recognized that they will build a new lighthouse for the Hengjia Zhangjia. Of course, there are also Many Taoists feel that the new sergeant may completely transfer the property of the phase port to a more suitable person to prevent the property from colliding with the free countries in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you said, sir... this glamorous lady?! I can’t see it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Not yet waiting for Di Meiyi to finish, as the mirror slammed her forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t be rude to the guests! Mr. Hartman, please sit down, don’t know her. I’m here to invite you because we’re going to empty all the time. The securities, you should have seen it on the letter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hartman nodded: "Yes, I am here for this." In the past few days, our two parties have enjoyed a good cooperation. Even in the hands of Bonnie Seyfer, the big black Zhuang has made a lot of money. I also admire the operation ability of your cross channel. But now I have not listened. Say that pure gold or United Bank’s underground account has a short-selling plan, and I have not heard of any changes in the frontline... Why should I empty it all?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yin Rujing Nodded: "Since here, I can reveal the reason for the short."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is it?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Seventh Fleet is about to resume magic communication. The number of pure gold agents is too large, they are also going to speculate Shipment, the unofficial agent of United Bank is close behind. But they have their own inside news, the action is really too big, giving us the opportunity to take the lead in short-selling..." Yin Rujing sneered, "So, I will While they were shorting, they pulled back the information line on their side, and the last briefing before the silence was released."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still I don't understand. Why does the Seventh Fleet restore the magic communication to be short-selling?" Ionette's face changed greatly. "Can it be said... The Elf fleet broke through the line of defense? Or was the Seventh Fleet completely destroyed?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, not so exaggerated. The Seventh Fleet is still there, and only two of the Elf Fleet have successfully embarked on the Western route. But there are some communication contents that are difficult to understand. You may only understand it as an empire envoy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Di Meiyi picked up a magical induction paper with his fingers, and the index finger smashed over it. Her magic power is small, but it is enough to make the content on this piece of paper clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They lifted the general slamming position at the junction of East Intres Bay and West Dive Long Sea. Here, the Imperial Expeditionary Fleet suddenly appeared from the northeast. And made an indiscriminate attack on the Free Navy and the Elven Navy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No difference attack?!" Ionite stood up in surprise, "This Impossible! This will be completely evil with the elves! I have not heard that the Expeditionary Fleet has received such authorization!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this report really says so Both the Seventh Fleet and the Sansen Grand Fleet suffered heavy losses. After the three sides fought, they each separated from the battlefield..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Ionet Standing up, "I can understand your suspicions, but I have never received such news, and there is no such thing as Olympia. If there is such a decision, this level of decision must be directly conveyed by the emperor's secret agent. It is by no means what we intend to hide from you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yin Ru Nodded: "The operation is profitable during this time, we will still exist under the account of the United Bank as usual. Please convey the greetings of Miss Zhang to the Royal Highness Princess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I understand. I will confirm the issue of the Imperial Expeditionary Fleet through my channel." Ionai features a head and is ready to leave. "Please also convey to me, Mr. Zhang, the greetings of my Highness and my Highness. Also, please I convey my personal greeting to Miss Bai Ruisi and hope to have the opportunity to meet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
