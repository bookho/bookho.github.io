What do you want to eat for breakfast?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sandwich, sour Cheese sauce."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two words were reflexively spoken, the memories of the baked bagels came to mind and looked sweet and delicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a sandwich, there’s no need to recall it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not that dream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The housekeeper left, but the content of that dream is still can not recall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laughed at himself and sat up from the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the bed is made of a single piece of glass. The four-corner bed bracket is also covered with mercury on the back and can be used as a mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the mirror, I saw that my long blond hair hangs on my chest and grows to my waist. It seems that I haven't taken care of it for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design of the bed is rare and there is no artistic beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to say it is like cutting a large glass box of a fish tank from the middle and then laying a mattress on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why would I make such a stupid bed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at the back of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the age is a bit too big, the memory seems to be getting worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But wait--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How old is my age?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not just the content of the dream, the emotion in the dream, the structure of the sandwich, or the reason for setting this stupid bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Who am I?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Where is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Why am I here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When aware of these seemingly important philosophical issues I found that I couldn’t think of it like a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can’t remember, I can’t remember, I can’t remember, I can’t think of it, I can’t think of it, I can’t think of it, I can’t think of it, I can’t think of it, I can’t think of it, I can’t think of it. I can’t remember it, I can’t remember it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how you look at your own shadow on the glass, you still can’t remember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;September 13th, 1666<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Metebexi River estuary liberation of the country's temporary military and political conferences, the land and sea double important Severus Fort <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today's Fort Worth took a shower. The rain stopped very quickly, leaving only the coolness of the early autumn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war and the summer are over, but life is still going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tents of the refugees stretched east along the north bank of the Mt. Bishop River, heading north, and heading east, at a glance, from the fortress, building a barrier River embankments, river docks, and coastal forts extend all the way to the harbour area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The south side of the bastion has been completely submerged by this refugee wave, the fortress and shacks are connected to form a temporary big city. The refugees collected the remaining supplies from the imperial camp abandoned by the emperor and lived there, just as the siege of the empire was not over yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Fort Worth Pier, the canvas tents and the sails of the huge fleet parked in the harbor are connected like a single The river formed by canvas is entangled with the water of the Metebeisi River and rushes into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young Liberation Army Major is resistant to the door? Soledon has covered his officer’s epaulettes and put on a cloak immersed in waterproof oil. Over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear soldier! Are you going to the beach to see the free ship, or pick up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Mr. Officer, want to buy some smuggled goods! The Seventh Fleet has just entered Hong Kong, the fresh Oriental goods, the real Huachao tea, is not a Taiping tea!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This general, we have a small boat, don't look at the surface, but can carry five tons of goods! If you have goods or want to sell the local products, I can also contact the Navy's logistics officer for you! The list doesn't matter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rain has affected today's business, and there are not many customers who come to the dock area in the rain. The residents in the tents rushed to sell, and did not stop for a moment, using a name that was more than a numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because many people’s intentions are not glorious, almost all military personnel passing through the camps will routinely cover their ranks, and refugees can only rely on common sense to judge The class of the coming. Of course, compliments are a bit higher and certainly no harm. The young man in front of him is not like a general. The guards who are generals are too young, but this does not affect their use of the highest ranking. If you can't make a sale in one day, the family will definitely have no food at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's borrow. Sorry. I am not interested."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is tight The poncho, lowered the military cap, put on an indifferent attitude, endured a burning eager gaze from the crowd, and pushed away unrelentingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not sympathetic to these refugees. Unfortunately, with his ability, he can't save a few people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this just-arrested war, only Lenny has produced more than 300,000 refugees, plus the number of refugees in the Western Syrian Republic. More than two million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These free citizens, quasi-free citizens and their wives and children who had lived an ordinary life were forced to flee their homes - or to put it another way," Go to the land of freedom." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the journey of freedom is not as beautiful as it sounds in the speech. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of farming areas in Shangyi, but there are many years of slavery. Local farmers are not willing to hire too many free citizens to work with their slaves. This will make them morally disgusted, they prefer to use horses or cows. East Ruhrlock’s land is poor, and Faures has a serious land annexation and is unable to absorb such a large number of refugees. Refugees who can't find a job can't sit on the mountain and can only continue to wander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people choose to continue southward and open up new fields in the subtropical rainforest of Meiya. Some people gather in the ports around Emerald Bay and the Interlaken Sea, waiting for the ships to the New World, Murrayman or the Eastern Powers. But the biggest refugee has always gathered next to the main force of the free army that keeps moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Free Army is both a government and an army. Since the establishment of the interim central government in the military and political conference in Fort Vatican, one army after another has come from afar and has repeatedly challenged the upper limit of the fortress. Every day, the logistics department and the engineering team are forced to work from early morning to late night. The Free Army has 50,000 soldiers, and the Free Navy has also mobilized 50,000 sailors from the stream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a matter of spending money from the 100,000 soldiers, it’s enough to feed 200,000 people who have low expectations and nothing. Some of the sailors at the dock received bribes, and some did not, but they were not willing to drive away the refugees who were living on the docks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young officers stopped in front of the outposts of the sailors. It was difficult for the sentinel to see his class from his army red cloak. He then saluted a military ceremony and asked: "Excuse me, this colleague..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Resist the door and shake the rain on the cloak, pick up the front corner, reveal his rank, and show the wax-coated parchment roll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the military and political council order is ordered, please inform the Governor that this order is for the commander of the Seventh Fleet, the Commander of the Seventh Fleet, who arrived in Hong Kong this morning. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Understand, we will immediately inform the Governor of Hong Kong. Do you want to go see him together?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I just waited for him to come over to the dock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door stopped at the end of the trestle and looked at it. The boating area in the distance. He still remembers the cold and clear scene on the dock when he served here, which is in stark contrast to the current scene. Fort Buddha is the top ten deep-water port in the world, but even if it is, it is too small for the fleet in the boating area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the real 'Red Fleet'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago It was only after this week that the Seventh Fleet, which was brought in by almost all of the fleet, was ported to Hong Kong, he realized the true power of the Free Navy...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of strength, everyone will stop in awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hill-like giant ships mostly have three to four layers of artillery decks, hundreds of light, medium and heavy artillery and magic cannons. There are four or five hundred sailors on each ship. The number of people on a ship is equivalent to one battalion of the army, and the firepower is almost equivalent to half of the army. After all, artillery cannot be deployed in layers, but ship-borne artillery can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to make a comparison, the elf ship "Kleon Emperor" that Nami has seen has only thirty-six medium and light artillery pieces, and the volume is not yet To one-sixth of these giant ships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Frontier Guardian number he had previously used was the flagship of the River Fleet, and there were only sixty-four medium and heavy artillery pieces and two decks. The flagship of each fleet is also smaller than half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more horrible is the quantity. It was only the seventh-level East Fleet that was ported yesterday, and it had such a special and first-class battleship. The other five naval marshals who came to the military and political conference did not bring the entire fleet, but they also brought their own flagship squad...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giants The giant sails on the battleships exude the red light of fire magic, and it is these fireproof technologies that have annihilated the ironclad arson ship that the Eastern Empire is proud of. When these giant ships stopped together, their sails and masts were like the red walls of the sea, blocking the sea level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a total of forty-two battleships and more than 300 light and heavy frigates on the outskirts of Fort Vatican. The total number of sailors exceeds 50,000. More than 30,000 sailors took turns to go to shore to rest, and the logistics department was suffering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 'Red Fleet' you are looking for is synonymous with 'Free Navy (modern)'. Now it's for you to jump. Some of the information has been contradictory. I will ignore the contradictory part."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds like Annie’s voice is ringing in his ear, then the text and line drawing are in the right eye of the door Unfolded in the middle, blending with the sights in front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, the one I just asked is not a question..." Namimen sighed. "Forget it, Annie, keep going."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now to get rid of the West Intresail fleet and the half of the Emerald Bay fleet, there is probably not such a large amount." The door stretched out his fingers and dragged the information in front of him. "The big ships in front of us, Is it the ship on the map?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The picture shows the famous special battleship 'fnvfreedom' (fnvfreedom), which is also the favorite sail of the boat model enthusiasts. One of the famous ships, and the empire's 'loyalty level'. The first real battleship of the Freedom Navy was built as an 'independent level' from the end of the 16th century, with 64 artillery pieces. After that, the Haimao Commission was designed and built. The second-class battleship of the 74-gun was 'flat level', the first-class battleship of the 88-gun was 'democratic', and the largest 100-gun's special 'free class', and a magic cannon was added to it. These ships were assigned Among the seven fleets, the three most important sea areas in the sail age were controlled by the Freedoms: the Endless Ocean, the Interlaken-Murray Sea and the Extreme East Ocean, responsible for the Holy Empire, the Elf, the Murray Man, and The navy of the Eastern Empire." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please continue." This paragraph has aroused the interest of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every officer knows that the Freedom Navy has seven fleets, but few people have been concerned about why the seven fleets are scattered and deployed in remote locations that are difficult to support. In the sea. The Navy guys naturally would not disclose these secrets to the Army - even the shipbuilding funds were obtained by the Sea Trade Commission itself from the taxation of ocean trade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Responsible for the endless ocean is the first 'Emerald Bay', the third 'Nanhai', the fourth 'New World' three fleets, the mother port is in The Witland Fortress of West Russell in the North Wing of the Emerald Bay, the Ou Dipu of Meiya, and the Freeman Port of the Free Island of Xinzhou. The second 'East Intre' is responsible for the Inter-Mulreman and The fifth 'Western Trey' fleet, the home port is in the phase port of Nanying and West Intre in East Intre. The sixth east is the sixth 'Golden Port' and the seventh 'East East' fleet. The home port is located in The Golden Harbor Peninsula on the west coast of Xinzhou, and the Lingyang Gate of the Far East Ocean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"While it is responsible for fighting against the Huachao Navy, suppressing the Spice Islands and the Pazhou Islands The Seventh Fleet is the biggest one.” The door was blind and blinked, and the few largest free ships were included in their field of vision. “Help me check which ship is the flagship of the Seventh Fleet, Anne.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the semaphore table, the goal is the first line on the right and the first in the first row."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp; "What is the semaphore above?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The naval marshal flag was not raised, the commander of the fleet was not on the ship." No matter what the content, the magic network voice It sounds like this cold ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember that the military and political meeting had already given the seventh fleet notice..." Nana shrugged. "Is it still a white run, but it is also I understand. It took me more than two months to get back from the East, and then I heard that it has ceased fire, and the capital has been lost by the army. I will also lose all my duties to drink on the shore."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can understand it, so I can save a lot of things." The voice of the slightly sacred tone sounded behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is turned over, and the master of this familiar voice slams the palm in the air according to the elf-like etiquette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After losing control of the river, the original commander of the Rivers Fleet, Leonard Kikawi, was sent here to manage the government of the Freedom. Capital port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is to be with you to the Seventh Fleet of West Intres, and their attitude towards this affiliation. It seems that you have to officially take office. It takes some time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The free army and the free navy’s military class are not universal, so as a free army major, Soleton does not have to rank Leonard Kakawi, the admiral of the Navy, saluted. In fact, the Liberation Army Staff did not even officially recognize the rank of the Navy. In their eyes, the Navy still has only the "Admiral" and "Ship" as it was a hundred years ago. The three classes of "long" and "deputy" are only three. From the naval marshal who is in charge of one fleet to the young lieutenant who wipes the deck every day, in the eyes of the army, it is only a variant of these three classes. Naturally, it is not necessary to strictly follow the military rank rules. The navy, which has been expanding rapidly for nearly half a century, is very dissatisfied with this, but it is helpless. There are so many folks in the Navy that have been recruited, and they have become the "big guys" of the Navy lieutenant and even the generals overnight. Even the Trade Commission itself has no choice for these guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not the Admiral. It's just the Governor. The River Fleet has ceased to exist because we have no rivers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the half-elves with a sarcasm The doorman smiled and eased the atmosphere: "Your lord has become more adapted to the climate of the South than when he last met."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Loney's hero Naimen Major Solonton, if you are also passing by the military law and the gallows, and then kicked to the military port as the governor, you will also change." The half-elf snorted, " Since you secretly learned the naval slogan, do you still need to send a liaison officer to the ship?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door thinks and shakes his head: "You don't need to go on board." But I want to know where Marshal Wayne went."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably a tavern." Leonard arbitrarily pointed to the west "The Marshal of Wayne of the Seventh Fleet is a very interesting person. If you go, I am afraid it is also white. The Navy and the Army are different. And the characteristics of each naval fleet are different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe the Navy and the Army are different, but the mission is the mission." The door hesitated, "And, the order I brought was not a bad thing for the Seventh Fleet, and several other Marshals agreed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf shook his head slightly: "Not enough. Everyone knows that the West Intl Sea Defense and the Naval Port will be handed over to the Seventh Fleet. If you know how much resources a fleet consumes, you can understand why they want to get more resources. As for the other ... their fleet size is not the size of the Seventh Fleet, and even have the opportunity to transfer a part of the fleet to the East East to divest the Haimao dividend, naturally will not object."<br /><br />&nbsp "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "You guessed it, the order I brought was indeed like this." Namimen tried to justify the decision of the military and political conference. "However, most people think this is an acceptable arrangement. West Intra Sea has the best port of freedom in all countries, and since The nations need the fleet. Now the empire and the elves of the outer sea fleet are still entrenched in our three or four ports."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But only the most profitable trade routes can feed the seventh Fleet. However, you are the next Intercontinental ambassador, maybe you can bargain with him... He is coming, you can also find a way to take office."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what to do with this position. "Nanmen smiled and said his true intentions. "Can you go with me?" I think the knowledge of the Army is not enough to convince the Naval Marshal. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard Kikawi was quick to accept: "I owe you a last time." Let's go. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two went out of the port together, and the half-elf governor also covered his rank to prevent being overwhelmed by the hungry refugees. He told several Under the squad, let them go through the network of sailors to find the naval marshal who did not know where to spend, and they and Stephan quickly walked through the riverside defense areas occupied by the refugees.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich refugees rented bungalows in the port area, or paid for a temporary shack on the bank. The fortifications used to defend the invasion of the emperors were covered. Men and women are sleeping on these Chase shops. This is a good overnight stay, and one night is to collect a silver coin. The poorer people are crowded in the tents on the street, or simply in the shadow of the coast fortress and the shooting trestle. Dealing with the bed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these shacks and tents, there is almost everything that officers and soldiers need. From churches to churches, newspapers, repairs Meeting with Masters, down to gangs, bars, casinos, 娼.........<br /><b r />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, all services that should and should not exist, as long as humans can think of, can be found in this huge refugee camp. The most popular, no doubt It is the publishing industry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The latest magic paper! For the future of a free country, buy the New Meitebe West Times, and donate a copper coin to the Republic! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are many outbreaks in the enemy-occupied area! "Free South Guide", your patriotic choice! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the false, the latest thirty-seven new magic evaluation! Buy "Higher Magic Newsletter" now, and also come with practice parchment! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "editors" and "freelance reporters" who had just taken over the roadside were selling their own newspapers while they were ready to go out to run the news. Nanimen doesn't know how many publishers in Fort Worth are printing a variety of newspapers and weekly magazines. They only know that the price of paper and ink in the market has doubled – even if it is still in short supply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a few days of copper, you can hire a literate, even literate citizen, which is a paradise for the publishing industry. In the military fortress of Fort Vatican, there is actually no other work to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the lives of these practitioners are definitely not decent. Most people can only barely eat and drink, and those who have no jobs for the time will go hungry. Even people who don't have the ability to work can only rely on the oatmeal and rye porridge that the Free Army gives from time to time. Those porridges are so thin that they can shine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where do you think Wayne will be?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a noisy environment, resistance The door did not dare to add a military rank. He believes that the Navy Marshal will not reveal his identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elves replied: "If I infer from the rumors I have heard, this marshal is very fond of the oriental style. In the rumor, the man’s temperament, Even the 'scholars' who can convince the Eastern Empire, it is precisely because of this that we can get Lingyangmen as the station of the Seventh Fleet. Only Fort Fort is a military fortress, it is reasonable to say that there is no such place..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nelmen thought for a moment: "Oriental luxury restaurants, there is really a new home. At the end of the west side of Robert El Pass."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield channel named after Lieutenant Colonel Robert Ayre, who performed outstandingly in the Battle of Fort Vatican, traversed the entire Fortress defense system, extending beyond the main plug, and eventually Ending the fourth basement on the northwest side - the second base was renamed Robert Al's second base without any suspense. The original warehouse on this passage was completely transported in the previous war, and was completely rented by newspapers and hotels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you familiar with these places?" The half-elf thought for a moment and suddenly realized, "Of course you should be familiar. Your new position is..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was busy raising his hand to stop the half-elves: "Don't let them smell the money or the power. They claimed to change the name to News Avenue." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the door looked around and hoped that no one noticed them. In the past few days, he has been tired of being tracked by journalists, and will be disguised as an ordinary soldier in the anti-detection cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to his surprise, no one noticed him and the half-elves. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as they entered Ayr Pass, the surrounding crowds appeared to be extraordinarily sparse, and there were not many refugees in the various defense zones on the east side. It seems that the reporters who are not much different from each other are running around and delivering the latest news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big news, in the seventh zone on the main Seysey side! The sailor has changed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sailor change can also be a big news? Recently there are two or three times a week, which fleet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fifth 'Western Terry Sea Fleet' This time, they have broken up the nearby security forces and seem to have the command of the former senior officer! Hurry up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would it be dangerous? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Rest assured, the free military gendarmerie of Fort Vatican is the strongest of the Freedom Army, even if there are thousands of sailors is not their opponent! The gendarmerie here But they are all elite troops fighting in Kengler, Jena and Lenni!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they say, on the west side of the fortress, burn It was a black smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenmen and Leonard face each other. The half-elves looked westward, erected their left thumb, alternately closed their eyes and measured the actual distance of the plume. This is a simple ranging method that every artillery officer and naval officer can master. It is also resistant to the door, but it is not so well used by Leonard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the black smoke caused by the riots, the position is in the middle of the west side of the fortress... It should not be so smart."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard frowned and recalled: "I can't say that it was a military secret. But the Navy Marshal of the Fifth Fleet has sunk with his flagship. In the order you received, did you mention the Fifth Fleet? The next arrangement?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door shook his head and shook his head: “No. In short, it’s not going to Lingyangmen, it’s impossible to rely on a broken fleet. It’s a complicated situation for the East. It seems that I still have to go to the scene and hope that it won’t be too big. Mr. Kakawi, if you want to leave, it’s okay.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go together. There will be nothing in the port." The half-elf rarely said it once, "If you miss the opportunity to get closer to the most dazzling new star in the Free Army, I will I regret it. Maybe I will have a fleet soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door did not answer this joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailor metamorphosis is a frequent occurrence. The sailors of the Free Navy have become particularly frequent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge ship with the red fire mainsail sails around the world, the battle flag is the battleship, and the navigation flag is the armed merchant ship. Thousands of naval colonels and lieutenant colonels, while performing their captain's duties, also served as an annoying position for capitalists, and their relationship with their subordinates was very different from that of the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each ship is a company, each fleet is a monopoly group, most of them must press the sailors to ensure that their ships can continue Sailing down. A warship needs oak and ironwood cut from North Coman's frozen soil to make the hull, pines and firs in the north of Saskatchewan to make masts and decks, and all costs back in the twenty years of sailing. And the funds of the next ship and even three ships and five warships. In Interlake, in order to maintain the normal operation of the world's largest fleet, merchants have developed stocks, bonds, insurance companies and shipping indices, almost every captain, even if his home port is far away from Lingyangmen or Freeman. The island, he is also burdened with tremendous pressure, countless contracts and incredible debt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of management methods, there is no way to restrict these captains. No transfer magic can ensure safe arrival on a ship with a variable position. Transfer orders are usually only possible after waiting for the port. There are only two reasons to stop them from being pirates: free naval regulations that kill innocent pirates, and large docks that are only found in civilized countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can't expect such people to be kind to their own people, and change is what you can expect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you open the history of the Freedom Navy, you will be able to see a variety of incredible causes of the mutiny. It’s not necessary to say that the conventional reasons such as the deduction of military squad or bad food are not necessary, because a large-scale transformation of a squabble, a fight, and a smashing of wine is also abound, because it’s not happening that jokes or fishing disputes have killed hundreds of people. Over. In some cases, people are not surprised by the freedom of the Navy, but because the sailors of the Free Navy are treated like this without surprise. Some ships have not sent a military squad for 13 years. Some of the ships’ colonists used their sailors to practice the undead magic. Some ship captains asked the sailors to practice jumping in the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in such a big red fleet, some people are known for being kind to sailors and good warfare - and such a reputation is particularly easy to spread. The names of these commanders are louder than their ranks or positions, not only the entire fleet, but even regional fleets and even other fleets. These people are generally very good at business, so they have the strength to be kind to sailors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Major Fleet of the Fifth Fleet Guards, Darlosalamis, has always prided himself on such a reputation. For the past two decades, his flagship and fleet have been known for their extraordinary business skills and generous treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not so much like a naval general, it’s more like a sea merchant. The Major General has a slightly blessed belly and a large beard, wearing a polar silk satin, smoking the best cigars in Xinzhou, and becoming a major general in the Fifth Fleet with the superb ability of "appropriate retreat". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it was the fiasco of West Indy’s sea battle, he escaped, and the fleet’s marshal, two generals and two lieutenants The fleet was sinking, and only three of the three wingers and defenders were alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, he is regretting his reputation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cause was that only a few sailors of the original Fifth Fleet drank more, and the sailors of the Seventh Fleet who had just landed had a squabble. The other party apparently came to occupy their territory, and the two sides quickly became a group and died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is quickly unaffected by anyone. There are not many sailors in the Fifth Fleet, and there are three or four thousand people, but these local snakes have been in the city for several weeks, and they are well aware of every battle preparation channel. They quickly dispersed the sailors of other fleets, concentrated their own people, and any sailors who were willing to join the riots, and controlled all the big men who sold gold in the pubs and shacks. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, they found the major Daro who was drinking, and supported him as the commander of the mutated army, "rebuilding the glory of the West Intresfle fleet." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the entire Western District was already in a bonfire, and the Army’s security forces had begun to suppress the surrounding sailors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daro knew that he couldn’t wash it, he had to start to order, and then save his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All uprising forces are concentrated in the new area on the west side of Air Pass! According to the original fleet structure, three layers of defense are organized according to the avant-garde, sideguard, and guard fleet. All the sailors who do not obey the command are regarded as rioters who are robbed by the fire, throw them to the army! Don't kill innocents, if you find out, you will slowly withdraw!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The order was sent out from the luxury hotel where he was requisitioned as a temporary command post. After finishing all this and confirming that his men were able to temporarily resist the attack of the regular army, he was relieved and began to count the cards in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he found that the cards he had seized were big, big and hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty or thirty intermediate officers will not say it. Those seemingly strange and dangerous priests and adventurers do not say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changed sailors not only left the bodies of the land, but also left some dangerous people they couldn’t handle, one brain concentrated on Darrow Salami Major General’s temporary command came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two most dangerous of them are the former adviser of the military government adviser Webster, and the commander of the seventh fleet, Pace Wayne. When I heard this, Darrow almost scared off his chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, do you want to go and see our hostages?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Let them stay there!” Darrow silently recalled the resumes of these two people, and puzzled them. “Let them be locked up with other hostages. It’s okay to send some obedient, honest sailors. They really want to rush out, and we can't stop it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but why don't they escape? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rear Admiral carefully looked through the list of names in his hand. Some people know him, but most people don't know him. There are a lot of people who see it is a pseudonym. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his instincts are saying that with the qualifications and strengths of Webster and Pierce Wayne, it’s impossible to be embarrassed unless they have anything. The purpose you want to achieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, we still have time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major General Daro pulled it casually The chair, sitting down on it, stretched out and looked at the fierce sailors around him, and smiled bitterly. He is better at doing business than the mutiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You send a few people up and carefully ask again about the identity of each person. Especially those suspicious empires. Do you have a magician? Even if it’s new school in the past few days.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked out a few of the most sinister faces and a little bit of magic. The ferocious sailors looked at him suspiciously, but they went up the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Next, let's talk about what to do. If the other party maintains the current pressure, maybe we can break through. Some of you are pioneers of the uprising. Now everyone is equivalent to my fleet staff, please see each other..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailor who was sent out to give orders before he finished Stumbled into the door of the hotel, his body was stained with blood, and his face had an unbelievable expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long, Chief... Independent, Independent Gendarmerie! It is an independent gendarmerie! They broke out and broke through!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hearing this sentence, Major General Daro The ground bounced off the seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can it be so fast! Let all the troops be withdrawn! The people nearby will gather all the muskets you can find, don't go to the streets, rely on the house to resist Fight for time! Be sure to fight for time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rear Admiral is too lazy to say more about nonsense like the staff, one person walks to the window on the second floor Looking at the black smoke and crowds not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change of the sailors in front of the gendarmerie seems to have no power to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Independent Gendarmerie is the product of a compromise between the Free Army and the Navy, and is the ultimate weapon in maintaining the order of the temporary capital of Fort. It consists of the elite of the Liberal Army's best, most experienced combat experience, and the most intense battlefields. Whether it is discipline, will or magical power, it is astonishing. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major General Daro saw that the squadrons who were barely queued were rushed by shots of bursts of shots. This is completely different from those of the previous squad training: there is no such firm advance on the sea, and there is no such neat and sharp charge. The chaotic formation formed by the sailors was hard to stand under the pressure of real war machines. The military sergeants of the independent gendarmerie regiment concentrated their magical powers and defeated the queues with non-killing spirits and disturbing magic. The mutated forces did not even effectively delay their speed of entry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, it can't be compared with the army... It's not an iron army that died in Jena and Lenny."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daro turned around and faced his own "Decree Staff". This is not the squadron of the government that was in charge of rebelling for seizure of power, but a group of drunkards who began to come to the fore. Everyone is nervously waiting for the order of Major General Darrow. These sailors were very good at robbing and killing people, but as soon as they faced the powerful battle of the army, they revealed the truth of their guilty guilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lamented his destiny in the depths of his heart and regretted his reputation in the past. Wrapped up by the mutated troops, there are hostages that can put a lot of pressure on people, and there is an independent gendarmerie regiment called the first strong soldier of Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe not only the military career is over here, maybe even life is over here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless...negotiating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Major General Daro seems to see another life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He considers himself to be one of the best businessmen on the two Intres at sea, buying low and selling high, buying short and selling all. As long as you can drag the other party into the negotiations, there is still a chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, there is robbery... No, collect magical flares and amplified magic for retreat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailors were confused for a while, and some people ran out of their doors to search for loot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darrow sighed again in his heart, but these people always brought him what he wanted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rear Admiral went to the window, opened the blinds, and put the magic signal representing the retreat into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please don't move on, the army's comrades. I am the commander of the uprising force, the commander of the fifth fleet guard sub-fleet, Daro Sarah. Rear Admiral Mi."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailors almost retreated and left the front. Perhaps the independent gendarmerie regiment has long been ordered, or they have not yet been chased by orders. In short, these powerful enemies have not continued to pursue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope is not an enemy, the general will change his mind. Their behavior has increased the hope of Major General Darrow to a greater extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe the young commander of the independent gendarmerie is a person who can speak the channel..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"We ask to negotiate with your commander."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rear Admiral paused to fill the pessimistic desperate feelings in his statement. These feelings are all true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are not trying to cause killing, nor do we want to harm the hostages and the general public in our hands. We only need our fleet, supplies, freedom, and loss. Our reputation. We have no intention of killing, and we are not interested in hostility. We are also willing to fight for the cause of the Free Army. Please listen to our voice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice has arrived The independent gendarmerie is behind the array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, mixed in the crowd? Soleton and Leonard Kakawi heard this request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the negotiation request of the other party, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds like their situation Not too good. It’s really troublesome. I’m also named to me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was opened, and the cloak was revealed, revealing a crimson uniform with only the right sleeve, approaching An array of independent gendarmerie regiments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under his bare left arm, there was an inconspicuous black pistol and a scabbard with a gorgeous one-handed sword. He did not bring out his own medal, but did not need a medal. Everyone in this army knew who he was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am back. Raise my flag and inform the other party."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he When the figure appeared under the command flag of the gendarmerie, the entire battlefield was quiet. Members of the gendarmerie who did not hold weapons in their hands turned around and saluted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this line of defense a strong operation? Well done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western total The most determined part of the military is the "strong transport" camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most tenacious part of the New Rennie Army is the "Iron Guard" camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two together form the independent gendarmerie. Whether it is combat power, preparation or replenishment, this is the most powerful group in the entire Free Army. It is said to be a battalion, but no matter the number of veterans, officers, or the configuration of magical combat power and technical equipment, it is probably a group of other troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am the commander of the Freedom Army Independent Gendarmerie, Major Nassau Soledon. I accept your request for negotiation. Soon I will pass." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is another position that Naimen got in these days. A position that would allow him to pick up the British Supervisor to make this hot potato. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appendix: About the Free Navy<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Navy began with a few small seesaws and eventually annexed almost all of the maritime forces within the Republic and established a large joint fleet. Between 1650 and 1675, its power once occupied half of the world's total sea power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the tradition of the Free Army, the Navy has only three effective ranks: admiral, captain, and lieutenant. Most of the others are just "positions", which were developed by the Joint Council's Marine Trade Commission, which is under the control of the Navy. The Free Army Headquarters does not recognize it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admiralofthenavy: The highest position in theory with the Marshall of the Force. It did not exist in the mid-17th century. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naval Marshal (Fleet Marshal = admiralofthefleet): Commander of the Navy's supreme commander of a fleet. The Army does not have a corresponding position. The position that emerged from the establishment of the Fifth Fleet is responsible for all matters in a remote sea area, and its authority is equivalent to the Governor of the Colony. For example, another position of the Marshal of the Seventh Fleet is the Governor of Lingyangmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
