This kind of travel is really unbearable for a white-collar girl born in modern times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to change clothes! I want to take a shower! I want to eat hot meals! I knew that I should fake the memory and say that we are not traveling to receive exercise. The trainee mage, it should be said that we are the savior of heaven, so that we can solve the problem with magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister, you have to bear it. "Bonnie; Sephiel calmly persuaded, "We will be able to arrive at the end of July. Besides, if you use magic at the frequency you ask, you will get tired of falling into the mud on the carriage every day." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if it's soft, I can soften it on the soft bed of Lennie's best hotel! I want to transfer... transfer..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of conversation happens almost every day, except for the scene and date. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The journey of the Age of Enlightenment, although not as dangerous and difficult as the darkness of the war or the chaotic era, is definitely not the kind of money that can be carried out entirely by later generations. Easy to travel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beginning of the journey is from the Port of Ellivi to Vander, the inner sea route across the Emerald Bay. Most humans are reluctant to cross the interior of the Sanctuary. The dense San Senli is inaccessible, and the non-elf travel is full of hardships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are riding a flat-bottomed passenger ship such as the "Dano"; when Lisa took the brigade and immediately sailed, it was almost regarded as a shipwreck. The pirates slammed into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to blame the crew, because someone in the accompanying pirates shouted out "all the property is handed over"... In short, boarding the ship It is a disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is a versatile Leonard who can calm the surrounding people; the former sea squad of Kikawi, the journey at sea is finally there. The situation was over, and it was safe to reach Vander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team rested for three days in Vanderbilt. Vatican Port is the most eastern port of Emerald Bay, one of the world's top ten ports, belonging to the Republic of Armenia in a free country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immedia is also known as the Southwestern Region. It used to be a gathering place for orcs, trolls, etc., and was re-introduced from the 11th century Southwest Conquest War. Holy Empire control. In Ioah, the war between humans and non-human races lasted until the end of the 14th century, and later went through the southern revolution of the 16th century. Most cities have at least two to three reconstructions; therefore, each in the Republic Large cities are full of new artistic styles after the renaissance era, and Vander is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this city full of revival-era art-style buildings, the team had to face a tragic emergency...hey, maybe It is expected that the incident is better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking, this account seems to be done a little late." The female alchemist took the money box and opened it, only to think that the coins were neatly arranged. Almost all have been unified into a good gold coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, the calculations lasted for two days, and there was no suitable money dealer in Port Ellivi, so it was only completed until now." Bonnie The account is published, "The result is a slight surplus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The final settlement result turned out to be only a slight surplus?" Reza looked at her with a sharp gaze In front of Bonnie, I seem to want to squeeze out two more eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie, who just returned from the money changer; Sefer bowed his head and quickly flipped the accounts: "mainly in these loans, some loan shark merchants borrowed I have to tell you responsibly that you only have a surplus of about 2,000 to 3,000 pounds. Some of the higher interest rates are already settled at the money dealer."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two thousand to three thousand... What can this do?" Reza had a headache. "If you have to rely on debt, how much budget can you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no need for an urgent debt, you can have about 30,000 pounds..." Bonnie hesitated. "But, this way, your family property can't be retrieved." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suggest that we can set up a caravan in Vatican and traffic some cotton to Lennie. It should also be a little profitable. There are also ready-made guards here..." Bonnie took the opportunity to throw out a long-prepared counsel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a good idea." Reza accepted the advice, and Annie and Bonnie smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the cotton caravan left Vatican and followed the uneven West Riverside Avenue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the cotton fields on both sides of the river bank, the girls are kneeling in the corner of the caravan, enduring dizzying bumps, imagining sitting in a senior carriage The happy life of Ms. Hermont. As she crossed the largest slave area on the ground, Anne, as usual, expressed her enthusiasm for "savior of the liberation of slaves", and then this enthusiasm was ruined by her sister with cruel facts. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the West Riverside Avenue follows the Rama Canal to the north, and in Rama meets the river that is known as the "blood of the South", Matt Bixi River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rama Canal was built in the middle of the second dynasty in the fourteenth century. It was the virtue of the "Korman family dynasty", which was built to connect the tower. Lati and Matthew West are two major river systems. The city of Rama, built at the end of the canal, is one of the many elf-era cities that have re-emerged since the independence of the South. Today it is a transit trade center with a flourishing mining and transportation industry. Rama is also the main support point for the Freedom Army's western defense. The 8,000 soldiers of the Seventh Division, "Great and Beautiful," are stationed here as a warning force against the possible invasion of the Sage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Rama, Kazmi; the former captain of Stewart had some trouble. When a group of people visited the site of the Southwestern Wudouchang site, they were detained by the local militia, the National Guard, as a suspicious individual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to rescue their loyal men, the half-elf Kikawi moved out of the "Emperor's Loyalty Ordinance" of the Age of the Elves of the Elder Empire to go to the Ministry of Public Security; His own barbarism and courage to support him, they also went together. Taking advantage of this gap, the girls visited the "Southwestern Great Battlefield Relics", "Conquering the War Memorial", and "Hugh; Talati Family Crime Exhibition Hall". The "Unicorn Fortress", which is known for its "magic beauty" and will be burned in the war, was not occupied by the Free Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they felt that there was no place to play in Rama, Kazmi was rescued from the detention center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the time when the pedestrian arrived at the temporary end of the journey, the Republic of the Union, and the common capital of all free nations, Lenny, was five days behind schedule, calendar It has been turned to July 20. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun gradually sank, the team finally stopped outside the southwest door of Lenny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lenny... We are finally here." At Anne; Sefer jumped out of the carriage and stretched the bones that had been smashed. She slightly loosened the tether of the leather armor and let the cool wind drive the sweat off the neckline. She was somewhat grateful that she had promised to have a new body. The modern white-collar women who lacked exercise all the time could not stand this kind of trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked up and saw the famous flag. Blue, green, yellow, and red, the four colors are divided by white crosses to form a four-color cross flag, which flutters under a slightly dimly lit twilight. The two white flags fluttered beside the flag of freedom, and the word was used as a symbol of the capital city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I was psychologically prepared, I still didn’t expect the size of the city walls to be so large. These walls should have been bombarded by carpet bombing during the mainland war. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first road of the five-way arch wall is in front of you. This brick-cement concrete wall was built after the Fourth Freedom War. The southern edge has been on the north bank of the Mt. Bishop River. From her location, she can see the big river not far away; the Lenny people led the Metebi River to the city and defended the city as a moat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, don't look at the places of interest, now you can say your sister's plan. We have already arrived at Lenny, what should I do next?" The sister of linen hair slowly moved out of the car. Her appearance was as calm and gentle as usual, and she could not see the hard travel after more than two months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"", plan? This is what..." Hearing this question, Annie was a little panicked and her hands uneasily swayed. "It’s first to Lenny, then ...and..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"December 7th...?" Annie snorted. "What day is that? The birthday of that person? Now that people haven't found it yet, consider whether it is early to open a birthday party..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing such an inconsequential answer, Bonnie’s forehead is about to see a blue smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Event change, event! 'One day coup"! Don't you hold a history book every day? Even if you don't see it, the biography of that person you always Looked! He claimed that his family died in this incident!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, that period is too bad, I only swept it..." Anne shrank back, and the little movement changed from a pickpocket to a female high school student. "People don't like tragedy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think you are reading a novel?" Bonnie sighed desperately. She is always very calm, but sometimes she can't help her own big sister. "Well, let me give you a tutorial."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On December 7, 1665, Laditz, Chairman of the Freedom Army Staff Meeting, who served for one year; Marshal Govar joined forces with the defending forces of the Lenni defending area and the 10th division 'Lenny' to launch a typical self-community coup. However, this coup was due to the activeness of Clade and Marshal Lopez. It was suppressed within, and even the politicians who planned the coup were not able to figure out..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you ask questions, Bonnie? Annie raised her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie’s right hand is like a pointer in her hand: “The so-called self-community coup is the politician of a democracy or some parties colluding with the military. A coup d’état, a coup d’état that cleans up other parties. This kind of coup usually will soon state the restoration of democracy and the establishment of an interim government. It is a disguised partisan politics and is very popular in the southern republics. Is there any other problem? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is this coup really prevalent... Oh, no, please continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "According to someone's autobiography, he lost all his family members in this incident. After the incident, because he was exactly 16 years old, he was enlisted in Latin, and he began to live in troubled times... but As I said before, almost everyone has concluded that the first half of his autobiography is not completely credible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least, he is a Lenny, this Should the point be true?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie thought about it, tried Nodded in the spot: "There has been a historian and a prophet who has verified that this should be true and support is quite powerful. The rest is complete..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I heard this, Annie slammed her fist and interrupted her sister's words: "The plan is very good! We settled down in Lenny, then wait, wait until the coup takes place!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah...? What do you mean?" Bonnie unconsciously grabbed her hair and "what is the wait for a coup?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then we can find the future of the door; Hugh; Coman!" Anne was so excitedly immersed in delusion, "When the chaos is about to kill his family, Ben The lady appeared as a savior '唰'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃,然, then?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Beautiful girl with a strong, transcendental magical power appeared in front of a young man who has nowhere to go, saved his family and his life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following...continued..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, the teenager will follow the mysterious beauty of the savior." Continue his life, they live a happy life! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop! "Hearing here, Bonnie finally can't stand it anymore." Sister, are you serious? Are you sure that your wishing technique didn't make your way of thinking back to the age of sixteen? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? is it not OK? "The blonde girl looked at her sister innocently. "I feel so good..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good..." Bonnie pressed her forehead with her right hand, weakly Soft down on the carriage, it seems to be fainting at any time. "Your so-called 'plan' is simply a story that will not be arranged even for an eight-point soap opera or a five-point girl animation... everywhere will let you I regret the loopholes in my life, do you still say 'very good'? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First of all, you can't determine the future of the door; Hugh; who is Keman? The name of the door means 'the person who does not exist', and Hugh; Coman is a surname, you don't know his current Identity and real name.” Bonnie; Seifer erected one long and one long finger. “Second, we have to wait here until December, then we must persuade Ms. Reza to stay in the city; but we are now I haven't figured out a viable solution yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first point is purely technical, I believe we can rely on various magic to solve. As for the first Two o'clock, just open a profitable shop?" The sister retorted indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What shop is good?" Bonnie asked. "The match is not good, the glass is not good, the cigarettes are not good, we have not learned steelmaking and metallurgy. Magic If you make an item, you may not have a market. If you print it, modern printing machines have been invented for almost a hundred years... Cement is in front of our eyes, even steam power has been put into use in many places. We must You can make a fortune by doing business that you didn't have in this era."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to have this era?..." Annie frowned. "It's better... It’s better..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her face suddenly turned red and didn’t say anything. The brown-haired girl asked strangely: "What is better?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Underwear store." Annie answered seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah? What did you say to your sister?" Bonnie said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bonnie, I mean underwear store. I have been fed up with the clothes of this era. Let’s make underwear and tampon, how?” On this topic, Anne's tone is full of excitement, "so we can finally get rid of the unbearable coarse petticoat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Underwear shop Is this really a good idea..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, selling standardized women's underwear, and then a name like 'the door of underwear.' Annie thought about it. "Is there always a market? Although it may be a little bit mad..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Weathering is not a problem, it only needs propaganda technology, Let me do it," Bonnie said with a smile. "I am getting used to the financial system of this era."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, let me tell Reza ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing her desire to go, Bonnie hurriedly stopped her: "Wait a minute, I haven’t finished yet, and The last one is the most important. Even if you really find the right person, you rescued him, everything is going well. Have you ever thought that the person you met, or the person you are swearing? You will re- ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her words are interrupted here, but both of them know what is not said later. When it came to Lenny, Miley finally couldn't stand it anymore. She can't watch her sister step by step to a hopeless future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about that? Then I can start to grow a beautiful boy! Isn't that good?" Annie replied with a big smile, but her eyes There is no smile in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this is different from the way you go to find the real one. You are going to obliterate him and then replace it with someone who is shaped according to your own wishes." Are you sure that this is really good?” Bonnie warned, “not to mention that you might save the wrong person, even kill the wrong person, and even cause a complete change in history... no matter which ending, sister, you are Unbearable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, it interferes with history, and then destroys the existence of that person when it is inexplicable." Anne pendulum I waved my hand and motioned that her sister wouldn’t have to say, "I have already decided... I want to find him the first time, even if I fight again with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I were someone, I might not like this arrangement." Bonnie shook her head. "Actually, your sister should come back thirty years later, so you will be able to find 'that person'. Why the wishing magic Will we return to this era?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& "Maybe it thinks this is the best. Maybe it's just yelling at me. Who knows?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne; Sefer yo, The eyes cast over the gates and shot inside the monsters of the huge city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
