What is it trying to maintain history? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Actually, we are like moths that fight fire..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has like water A girl with long blue hair, marching along the central avenue to the east - perhaps, it is described as a leisurely stroll. Behind her, followed by a small team, the captain of the team tied a sharp samurai sword at the waist, looking ahead and expressionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her name is Bartholomew; only, hidden in the dark, fascinating and beautiful vampire killer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her name is Bonnie; Sefer, a quiet and elegant and inaccessible trainee Protestant pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her name is Melia Yana; Quillahiya, a genius magician from 250 years later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is an outstanding actor, she has countless different identities and looks, even if her sister who lives with her does not know her identity. If she does not become an important member of the arbitration association, one of her names will be included in the list of the best movie stars of later generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie walked one after another at the intersection, one after another. The busy Central Avenue seemed quite deserted. There was almost no one. Only the Lopez Army’s squadrons and sweeping troops were running away. In the west of Central Avenue, there was no even a coup to dare to go to the streets. She relied on the warrants and team badges from Hull; Major Tedwood, and she was unimpeded on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stops and stops, looking at the sky from time to time, looking around, looking at the dark corners of the surrounding buildings, as if looking at the scenery, and seems to be waiting for something . While Hull; Tedwood's team flew past, she carefully hid to the side of the road and waited until he left to move on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At about 8:30, Bonnie finally strolled to Liberty Square in central Lenny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no special building around Freedom Square, it is just a hub connecting the major political buildings of the Republic of the Union. From the square to the west is the parliament building, from the square to the east Supreme Court, from the square to the south is the Lenny government, from the square to the north is the ring. At this time, it has become the central command hub of the Lopez Army facing trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if there are 4,000 people gathered here, the Freedom Square is still in perfect order. More than 2,000 soldiers owned by the Lopez Independence Group, and at least the same number of prisoners, are concentrated here; the maples and low shrubs that divide the squares can be used to divide the troops into small pieces according to the company. Do not interfere with each other. Perhaps, at the time of its original design, it took into account this use as a temporary military command center. The defensive structure of the entire temporary command site is bounded by ten semi-circular self-propelled guns and ten infantry combat companies, while the commanders are gathered in the center of the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie waved his hand and motioned for Katzmi to stop waiting; the former pirate captain nodded his face. She walked to the core of the battle. The soldiers saw the "interlaced gear" badge on her chest and smelled the faint lilac smell on her body. They all let her pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it still not working, Hull? The crowd can't always be dispersed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krad General Lopez’s face is serious, and there is a deep sorrow hidden between the eyebrows. I don’t know if it is a worry about the situation, or worry about the next battle, or worry about my loved ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sorry, sir, we have tried our best, but the crowd has gathered more and more, they use our bodies to block our gun cars. Our troops, Even the people can't get close to the crowd, and chasing is even more difficult." Hull, who commanded two attempted breakthroughs, bowed his head and apologized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have to apologize, it's not your responsibility. We are sworn in under the four-color cross, and we must never fire at the civilians." De looked at the map on the table, "Go around. How many roads may pass?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her and the surrounding staff whispered After a while, I reported the conclusion. "There are four things in the east-west direction, one in the north and three in the south. The information is not up-to-date, so you may not be able to accept the letter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please choose the north side and take the Stora Cathedral."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magnetic and attractive women singed and painted with blue nail polish Cross the map and draw an arc that points directly to the Supreme Court of the Eastern Third District. Lieutenant General and the major raised their heads at the same time and saw the blue hair of "Bai Si Si; Wei". Clade sinks and opens his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s you. Take the liberty to ask, how did you find the vampire party hidden in the parliament?” To everyone’s surprise, Clade did not ask The reason for the other party to make this judgment is to ask about the recent parliamentary incident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I am an expert." The girl's small chin is slightly raised, with an unspeakable arrogance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard this answer, the general turned slowly and took two steps and turned back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the troops head north, set off!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie did not wait for the Lopez Army to finish All the preparations for the march will take about fifteen minutes. She returned to her own team and allowed everyone to continue northward along the central street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that the young, promising little correction is staring at her back, but she doesn't think it matters. She also knows that some bats are quietly passing silently in the air. She also knew that the hand of the former pirate captain was always pressed against the handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kezmi; Mr. Stewart, you don't have to be so vigilant. I know that betrayal is your hobby, but my employer has promised that never It’s all valid.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, she suddenly turned and said. This action stopped both Kazmi and his men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, just getting used to it." Katzmi let go of the handle in his hand. "I don't mean to be enemies with you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But all you bring is your buddy cronies." The blue-haired girl chuckled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, the correction is 'after seeing your strength, there is no meaning to be enemies with you'. I don't want to solve the vampire easily. The elder's guy is an enemy. Originally, I thought, if the situation is right, I will use force to escape..." The former pirate captain spread his hands. "Damn, 'pure gold' has hired a group of monsters."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, aren't you one of the monsters?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Raise me, Lai Nade, Reza, you... all of them are monsters that are much more terrible than me. I will never have the terrible idea of ​​being an enemy of the local undead, but you can take this abnormal idea. Put it into practice. It’s really a group of monsters.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie cocked her index finger and shook: "In any case, the undead will be destroyed sooner or later. Who will come? Eliminate, why not? Well, say back to the topic. Since you have completed the mission, I can fulfill the employer’s promise."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That promise?" Katzmi took a deep breath and let the eyes look forward to the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is that promise. As a reward for your battle tonight, your freedom will be guaranteed by the 'pure gold' and all members of its shadow organization, there will be no Anyone is going to chase for your departure. Now you can go to the south, there is a 'sloop' (sloop, small dhow) at the port, and the hand on your hand should be enough." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to these words, Katzmi; Stehaus pointed at the other’s eyes and looked at the film. The bloody red ochre is unpredictable, but it is not easy to see signs of falsehood. He nodded and took two letters out of his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Troublely handing these two letters to Ms. Hermont and Mr. Kakawi, it is my goodbye message."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will do this kind of thing?" Bonnie took the letter with surprise. The two envelopes are of different color and the recipient's name is written in italicized italics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I used them before, this is an apology. Goodbye."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right, there is still a problem. Bonnie; who is Sefer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...I don't know," Nie took care of her chin and thought about it. "But I don't want to be against her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is also true."<br /><br />&nbsp After watching the departure of Kazmi and his men, Bonnie took the two letters into her arms and looked up and studied the style and decoration of the nearby buildings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two, four, six, eight, nine, so the number is almost the same, there is no one who is in the way..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her right hand shines with golden light, and her left hand grips the silver pistol filled with bullets. She kicked her on the floor with her boots, and her body suddenly vacated and stayed on the eaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunshot and the golden "Glory Arrow" shot at the same time, piercing the body of a vampire and a war corpse. The two unpredictable creatures that were caught off guard suddenly became the ashes in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nine has become seven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless figures suddenly jumped from the dark Out, trying to surround the woman with long blue hair. Bonnie did not stop, the magic boots at the foot kept on, and quickly left the encirclement network. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The magic of jumping boots can take up to ten minutes, catch up! All attention to defense, not to be shot by that bullet or glorious arrow!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Bishop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To deal with the unfortunate eight-stage second-rate wizard, you have to use one The lich plus eight senior undead creatures... It’s really scary.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a jump between the buildings, and she moved in the direction of the North Gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver light flashes, Jianfeng sweeps the neck of a zombie with a strong wind; the owner of the sword takes advantage of the situation and uses the tip of the iron boots to The dead body kicked down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind, another corpse gymnastics dagger rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight’s wrist swayed and smashed another dead body that was forced from behind. Instead of using that extraordinary and unique fighting technique, he began to show his equally amazing swordsmanship. The action of the silver sword in his hand is very simple at first glance. It is not as full of tricks as the fine swords and swords. But if you look closely, the swordsmanship that opens the big game is very practical. The knight's action is dominated by sniper, with occasional sniper; plus a few moves to quickly turn and spin the sword, it constitutes a difficult defense network. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is by no means the "duel" or "demonstration" sword technique that most pampered "Knights" are good at, but can be put into practical use. technology. The four major knights have a total of at least 30,000 knights, and there are very few such skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did he belong to the inner ring before becoming an adventurer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First The tax official's brows were slightly wrinkled, his lips were moving, and he gave a silent order to his undead. The undead creatures, which should have lacked intelligence, are able to advance and retreat under his command, implying a strong and powerful command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ghouls are his eunuchs, the zombies are his heavy infantry, his light infantry, and the ghost is his guerrilla. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the zombies who were not resistant to the sword were pulled back and replaced with the second squadron with 骷髅 as ​​the main force. The Cavaliers' speed of breakthrough immediately slowed down - the zombies and humans have almost the same weakness, but they are different. If you use the swordsmanship against humans to deal with cockroaches, you will often find the gap between the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line of defense for undead creatures is still tighter than it was just now. The tax official looked back and the line of defense and the crowd had a distance of about 100 meters, and the distance was still widening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, everything went well...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just at the moment of his distraction, a warhammer Opened his defensive array. The warhammer in the middle-aged pastor smashed three skulls, and the knight behind him broke into the air. The two used a weapon to deal with the zombies, and one used a blunt instrument to deal with the shackles. The cooperation was very tacit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can only use that trick... to surround them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul was diligently carrying his men around, and some of the defenses were retracted, trying to The two are surrounded by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pressure faced by the adventurers immediately increased and they had to back-to-back to resist each other's attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are a lot of opponents, uncle, is there any way?" After a round of attack, the knight named Xiu Lan asked the comrades around him, "I don't want to Use the power here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is only going forward?" The middle-aged man smashed the warhammer and repelled the enemy's round of attacks. "How do you think human flesh breaks through this idea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shulan face revealing: "Will it be a little stubborn?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it." Uncle's right hand was heavily shot behind the Cavaliers, "...repulsion"!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The six-segment of high-level magic was immediately launched, and the knight's side immediately enveloped the blue repelling field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All undead creatures subconsciously retreat two steps and give way. Grasping this gap, the middle-aged priest launched another round of divine dispelling, letting them stay for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you!" The knight clenched his hilt with his hands and leaned over, rushing forward with the effect of repelling. There is no obstacle between him and the Necromancer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance between the two is getting shorter and shorter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the face of the Necromancer has not changed. The first tax official just quietly raised his left hand and swept through the air, launching a strategy that had already been prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...explode, my bombs. corpse explosive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All zombies exploded at almost the same time. Countless flesh and blood hit the rejection field around the Cavaliers, forcing him to stop moving forward. The resistance caused by the exclusion field is the two sides, it will stop the action of all people and all objects. The zombies arranged by the Necromancer in front of him were popped in a specific order, so that he could not move forward for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opponent’s combat experience must be very rich, and he can decisively abandon all his men’s hands to make cover... “This may not be so easy to solve” The idea flashed in the mind of the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle Jeter, nothing! His Majesty Namlock?!" he asked back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After being hurt, it doesn't matter... Hey... It's hard to break through the defensive net, you are going to chase!" The middle-aged man replied with pain. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't mind." The voice of the female pastor came from the last. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers feel a little relieved - and finally did not cause the worst ending. Although the other party is well-prepared, but the real strength is nothing more than this...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pressure of the corpse explosion has finally disappeared. Through the effectiveness of repelling, Xiu Lan broke through the dark areas and fog of the other side, destroying all the ambushes and traps prepared by the first tax official. Neither a beggar, a zombie or a ghost can get close to him. He clenched his sword and rushed through the blood and bone defenses...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he saw the black stars scattered in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical black pearl powder is scattered in the air, reflecting the distant fire, watching like a black star. Where the black pearl powder floated, the corpses on the side of the road slowly climbed up and looked at the direction of the adventurers with the eyes of the godless. The distance controlled by the vampire is about 500 meters away, and it will disappear at the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be kidding, is there still a second line of defense?! How much magical power this guy has!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xu Lan has tightened the hilt. Now, only hope Pike; Tap can stop the vampire...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young thieves lurk in the crowd, holding their own two daggers in their hands. There are so many people around, and it is impossible to hide in the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More.........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful young vampire deliberately created a crowd of people around him region. Controlled civilians and vampire blood servants are mixed and hard to come by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind the scenes of the partners, it seems that the battle is not too smooth, the fighting is getting weaker and weaker, and the distance is getting farther and farther. It’s tricky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a way to hurt a vampire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man’s voice whispers He said in his ear. Parker squinted and saw a young boy who was not very eye-catching. The other side turned the eyeball in response, but then put it back in a dull look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." The thief snorted and turned the grip of the short stick in his hand. The light on the stick changed from the blue thunder to the white light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good. I create opportunities for you, you attack him from behind." That younger voice, shaking the holy water bottle in his hand. His hand trembled a little and looked scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you? You are shaking." Note that the opponent's hands are just ordinary holy water, knowing that the vampire's powerful adventurers are concerned. The five words are already a lot for him who is silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager smiled a bit, holding his right hand with a slightly trembling wrist with his left hand, did not answer. He slammed his head down and rushed over the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...flying, glare ball! dazzle spray!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dizzy The purpose of the white light illuminates from the hands of the juvenile, and all the blood servants and humans who see this glare have their eyes closed. Through the cover of the glare, the thief rushed to the back of the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original person was a magician, he thought. Do not know if strong or not? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This ability, dare to challenge! Not self-reliant!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful juvenile The vampire scorned with his magnetic voice, and at the same time came a sulking sensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let your ugly face rot! Not handsome men, not qualified to live in this world!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will pull you down together... look at the holy water!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of holy water is a chance! Parker; Tapu violently launched, the short stick in his hand directly stabbed the heart of the beautiful young vampire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the intersecting weapon. Parker only felt that the weight in his hand suddenly decreased, and that only half of the short stick that shone with the Holy Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, this three-level glare can't interfere with me. So I want to count on me, your human practices are really filthy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glare has passed. The beautiful teenager sneered, and a transparent short sword in his left hand flashed and shook under the illumination of the surrounding oil lamps, giving off a burst of chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ugly face is not beautiful at all. I believe that the third-rate wizard can draw my attention, you have to blame him for blaming... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young thieves felt a desperate moment. Now, it is impossible to get help, and the weapon has been destroyed...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no waiting for him to close his eyes, and the continuous gunshots suddenly sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think this kind of mortal weapon is useful to me... Silver bullets... You still have holy water...? Ah, my eyes! My face! !!""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's now!" The young magician's voice rang again, "stinging his heart!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
