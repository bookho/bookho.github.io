He has experienced almost all major battles of the Free Army, but there is not such a battlefield as difficult as it is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the scene they saw for Zarte Fran and Sister Verentina?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He completely launched his tactical command potential, and built the "enemy" in the mind to understand the situation at the fastest speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For Fran and Sister Weilen, what they saw was that I was holding a left-handed Annie on the bed. It may be a bit too much to say that it’s going to roll around, but they shouldn’t see it before the shock. It’s all about imagination... Damn, isn’t it more unfavorable to me? This perverted reputation is quick to sit. Really."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion is quite discouraging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s more difficult than falling into a trap, that is, not only falling into the trap, but also hiding the mines that you have buried. The door feels a little difficult to breathe, and things seem to have become somewhat unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These thoughts all happened in less than five seconds. During this time, Zalt let go of the nun's hand and shrugged at the door, saying that he had done everything he could. Obviously, he does not believe that the door is innocent, but he does not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nun went up two steps and asked: "What the hell is going on, Soledon? Well?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door stepped back two steps, swaying on the bed, opening his lips with difficulty, trying to say something, but not knowing what to say. The cause of this situation is too complicated, and he does not know how to make it clear in a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cast a helpful look at the blond girl in her arms, only to find that Anne’s face is not much better than him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl wearing a messy uniform and a shy face read two spells in a panic and re-equipized her substitute arm and legs. She broke free from the hands of the door, stood up and gave a deep sigh to the nun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister Weilen, I am Anne Sefir... I haven't seen you for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as she bent down, she found that the military pants she was wearing in her lower body had been cut off in the previous battle. The length of the remaining fabrics was not enough for the ultra-short skirts. The military uniforms on the upper body were also very messy. Anne looked around in a panic, and found the uniform of the previous Jeanne, and put it on her body in a hurry, looking like an active criminal who was captured on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, Miss Sefer. I am asking Sorelton now, and you will say something later."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Wei Lun’s face was covered with a layer of rigid frost, which lowered the temperature of the entire room by a few degrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We thank you for building a secret base for refuge for us, but this is another matter. You rudely said goodbye last night, now I sneaked back in this room... In this room... Don’t worry about anything, it’s another matter. What I care about now is, after a few months, my family’s Soledon did something. God and the name of their sacred agreement, I don't know that there are still some people in this hospital who want to be married before... I want to be married before... In short, that's it. Well, Soledon?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen and Anne secretly exchanged a few eyes. In general, it is very difficult to exchange information with your eyes; but in some unusual situations, you can communicate with each other with just a few blinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Same feeling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you have a lot of questions. Some things don't seem to be right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I have, and I know that you have it. We both feel that something is not right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No matter how much doubt you have with each other, but Now this situation is very unfavorable to us. We all need the help of each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. In front of the powerful and tactical enemy, not our guilt "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. First think of ways to stabilize the enemy, you and I provide fire support to each other. Annie, then we still follow the old method, I am going to launch a battle plan, and you will improve and implement it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete. Give me the wing cooperation and support."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This communication has not been used for five seconds, and the cooperation in the staff has produced significant results in the past few months. At this time, Sister Verentina has not finished the words that will be deleted by the **Census. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best defense is offense - the man who was later called "capture of the genius of the fighter" thought so, seized the opportunity to launch a counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door cough snorted, the board raised his face, jerked up and used his height to change the momentum ratio of both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister Weilun. It doesn't matter how you guess me, but you must apologize to Lieutenant Saffir. The wounds and disabilities on her body are in today's What remains in the battle, she is worthy of the title of a true free army hero, you can not use her exaggerated imagination to smear her, nun!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the words, I left a tail deliberately and stopped my eyes on Teacher Zalte. Zalt really didn't hold back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today's battle? How is the battle, who are you fighting with?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Imperial The emperor. There are all his main aristocrats and ministers." Ningmen replied casually. "This is a long story. I have a chance to talk slowly. The important question now is that the nuns have to apologize to her!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of this compelling momentum, Sister Wei Lun was also aphasia for a moment, and took a small step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, what I am going to say is Soleden’s problem! Not Miss Sefer..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the nun's momentum is low, the corner of the door is slightly raised, and the little finger of the right hand is gently hooked to Annie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne nodded intently and suddenly turned to stand next to the nun, slamming the door with a right hand. This sudden action scared the nun a big jump and blocked the topic she wanted to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorlayton, don't talk to the nun in such a rude tone, the apology is you! She said I don't mind, as long as we have our own conscience Just fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie deliberately extended her left hand and took the nun's arm. The cold and hard arm was attached to the nun's skin, causing her to tremble slightly. The smile on her face is a bit charming in her enthusiasm, just like the smile that a young girl will bring when she first goes to her boyfriend's house to see her parents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of such a smile, the topic that the nun originally wanted to say is how can it not go on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, do you think my base is still easy to use? Normally, this entrance and exit will not be used. Is it functional? What's the problem?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne secretly converted the topic and focused everyone's attention on the secret base. Of course, she also deliberately stopped her eyes on Zalt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, because from the morning I suddenly can't use magic, Wei Lun's magic is not normal, the transfer point in the base can not Normal work. We wanted to try the emergency operation in the array. I didn't expect to start the emergency entrance and exit." Zalt explained, "Of course, we didn't expect this room to be empty..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing this, Zalt and Wei Lun once again widened their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You... defeated the main army of the empire?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come in: "Yeah, also defeated all of their main generals. If it wasn't for the emperor to run fast, maybe we would have ended the war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Well, let's not say this. Take the last Freedom Army report. Everyone can see it.” Anne dragged Sister Weilun down the stairs. “Fr. Fran said that the transfer point cannot be used. I think this is not possible. Let's go ahead and see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She threw a look at the door, and the door was willing to follow, Zalt also Had to go back to the secret base with a few people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people walked down the tunnel, the tunnel behind it was closed again, all the cover magic was restored, and there was no longer a mage from the outside. The entrance to the secret base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nun still feels something wrong: "But, you just..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie leaned closer to her In the ear, the voice is depressed: "Please believe us, we have really done nothing. There are many ways to prove this, but now the time is tight, then we have to go to the parliament."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nun will be slanted by the suspicion of Anne, but the tone has softened: "Really? Nothing happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it is true." Annie thought about it, pressed the voice lower, and added, "You don't have to worry, I want to be in line with the doctrine... 'that' should not be too far away And, the final future of Soledun will probably exceed your imagination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence really dispels the nun’s doubts . She looked at Annie again and touched her left arm with her hand: "The injury is really heavy. I can't do anything, but in Lenny, I can still find a bishop who can treat this kind of injury. The broken arm is still Annie?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie smiled a bit: "The arm is a smashing attacking magic. I used to forcibly heal the leg, cut off the blood vessels, and should not use magic. Replanted. Besides, I have a way I can do it without you worrying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if there is a way, it must hurt. These men... "The nun shook her head. "How can a young girl be so sold? Last night, too, I called you back to the military at the big night. It is for this battle today. I shouldn’t have said that you were rude. You are also very hard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Responsibility only." Anne underestimated the part about herself and concentrated the problem on the part of the conversation she didn't know. Above, "Speaking, apart from that, I didn’t do anything rude last night. Sometimes? Sometimes you can't find it too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides leaving is too hasty, it should be gone. You also complimented last night." Saying that my meal is delicious, it is nothing compared to pure gold.” The nun noticed the brooch on Annie’s chest. “Ah, that brooch is actually a bargain, there is no magic effect, you don’t wear it. Next to the Magic War Officer badge, the Aura will cover it. I think the right chest may be more appropriate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This?" Annie looked down at herself. Put on the short brooch, "This brooch was yours before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, actually, when I gave it to you last night, I felt that I couldn’t take it. Sister Wei Lun smiled slyly. "To be honest, this is a bargain than the pure gold and blue diamonds. It is not worthy of a female officer of the Free Army..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie glanced back, rubbing her teeth gently and rubbing her canine with her tongue "How come, I like this brooch very much. I like it very much in the reincarnation style. I like the beauty of metal in simplicity. If you don't mind, I want to make further magic items for it. Remodeling, so that it will not be covered by the badges next to it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two women talked very much, walked at the end of the team The door to the door? Soledon suddenly felt a chill coming from the end of the spinal cord. He stopped and touched the crystal wall next to him. He didn't find any special defensive magic. He had to follow the team with doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zalte Fran heard the question of the door, and took the finger and figured it out: "Annie is here to arrange for people to build here after you go to military service, and also to get their 'pure gold' hostess Reza's License. The construction time is three months."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three months." The door touched the wall next to it, some could not believe it, "three months Can I build such a huge base? I guess it costs a few million pounds?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vui Lun made a special trip to find Reza to ask this question, she It is said that this is the main core of the 'Pure Gold' and the Lonnie Refuge. The larger scale is appropriate. Later they used it to transfer some fragile goods and dangerous goods that were inconvenient to transfer by sea. Ray Division."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zalt sees the door looking back at the direction of his room, knowing what he is thinking, continues to explain: "Then you have been During the war, we are afraid to tell you the leak. Besides, we don’t know that they have set up the spare exit in your room. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How big is the size of the base? Export exports, official exports, spare exports, there are three light exits, and there is a transfer point..." Nanimen began to feel that Anne said "I can fix the body here" is not nonsense. "There will be no underground city below? Is there a maze and a demon?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zarter smiled awkwardly: "Not a dungeon, but what... you see it yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes he I saw the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the eyes of a group of people, not a dungeon, but a huge room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An amazingly large underground room, bigger than all the single rooms that Nami has seen, he can’t even visually tell the length of each side of the room. . This empty, huge room is at least as large as the entire welfare home – if not bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room supports the top with a complex column and a diagonal reinforced steel system, the structure of which he has never seen before. After knowing Anne’s “future person” status, Nami believes that it is a design that has not yet appeared in this era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This huge room is empty, and only a few multi-story racks that are taller than people divide the space into many walkways. Ordinary mage towers or secret underground bases are crowded. People want to pack a variety of materials in a toilet-sized secret room. This room is completely different. It is not so much a refuge as a senior mage, but rather like a huge warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is bigger than the central conference hall of the parliament." The door stopped and could not help but sigh, "Maybe only the palace of the emperor can "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zalt shook his head: "Unfortunately, the Imperial Peace’s new Peace Palace is not so big. What you see is already moved. After the empty hall, when Reza came here to arrange the transfer, a large iron box bigger than the people piled up the entire room, I suspect that they would have to transport an army to occupy Intre. Those big iron boxes By manpower, they can't be dragged. They can only rely on the magician or their automatic magic images to drag."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is low and looks at the traces on the ground. The ground is all paved with sturdy obsidian tiles, but even so, there are a lot of scratches on the golem and the big iron box, and some magical circuits carved with precious metals are set in the lower layer of the scratches. He knelt down and wanted to analyze the structure and scale of this magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zalter stopped and waited for a moment and said: "Don't try it, I can't read it. It may be the technology of the Dongyi system. Said that there are some schools in the East that are famous for painting magic array technology."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door stood up and said: "I know that I don't understand, just want to see more different. Technology. This technique seems to be somewhat similar to the way we used to construct transport anchors and liaison arrays."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zalt nodded in appreciation: "In the past few months, your vision has improved a lot. Their company is currently the best company in the South in terms of exotic magic and Dongyi magic. The technology used in this array includes some and two masters. The standards of the association are not the same. The practice of loop structure and effect lines is very interesting..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are afraid of being careful with the scorpion of exotic magic Sell ​​some magical results that are more advanced than this era? In the heart of the door, I thought about it with a bitter smile. I stood up and chased the steps of the women in front of me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the word of the transmission anchor point, the corner of the door of the door twitched. He immediately remembered the location of the Lenny Center that had been completely destroyed by Renee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it impossible to use it yesterday morning? Can other public delivery points in the city be used?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know." Zalt recalled, "You said that it seems that all public positions from yesterday have been requisitioned by the military."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister Anne and Dr. Weilun have stood at the metal table at the end of this empty hall. The table is a common transmission positioning point, which can be positioned in one direction to several major public positioning points in the city of Lenni. Although the cost is relatively high, it is not uncommon. Generally, it is more important for people with status status or important public places. Have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a matter of course to transfer the public transfer point to Nancheng District." Anne stood at the table and pushed open a few movable tables to reveal more complex The magical array, "First of all, before Reza used it to set it to transmit at a very long distance, of course you can't reach the Nancheng District. Secondly, the Lenny transfer point has been... probably blocked by the military, now it can't In use, our relative data is based on the absolute coordinates of the Lennie transmission point, and naturally it cannot be used. To transmit the magic to the ferry crossing point in the South Third District, some adjustments must be made."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is going forward, watching Anne skillfully adjust the various emblems and hands between several different pieces of metal. Some metal sheets are written with plain text in the transmission positioning coordinates. The door is aware that these are common coordinate points centered on the central positioning point, and can only transmit between the fixed ordinary points with limited distance. Still others use passwords and essays to write complex tokens, presumably the positioning calculation formula used by Anne themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised him was that there was actually a transfer positioning coordinate written in Imperial text on this board. He couldn't help but stare at the metal plate for a while: even if it's just ordinary coordinates rather than absolute coordinates, it's probably not easy to get the board. The normal coordinates are calculated using the absolute coordinates with respect to the center point. Since the absolute coordinate data is not included, usually only the point-to-point fixed transmission can be performed, and unlike the center point, an arbitrary target positioning point can be selected for transmission. Transmitting magic is a magic that leaves the caster dead as long as it fails, and you can't do it rashly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not DeLand, don't think about it, it's the new Komania's anchor point in the New World." Annie saw that he was staring at the board. Say, "We use it to contact the business partners of the New World."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute." Zalt Fran suddenly inserted, " Miss Sefer, if my understanding is not wrong, can you not only adjust the transmission between the ordinary point and the center point, but also adjust the position of the center point you want to go? In theory, you must have that The absolute position of a few points is enough. Even the transmission coordinates of the new Comania and Intres should be state secrets?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃... ..." Annie paused a little and looked at the door. He seemed to be hesitating, but in the end he said, "In fact, we have our own positioning points in Interry and the New World."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence shocked both Zarte and Sister Weilen. Only Nana knew that Anne must have some advanced technology in the future. He didn’t show his shock on his face. He just wondered how Annie did it. In the past year, they have been busy running companies and fighting, and certainly have no time to map one. Absolutely locate the data of the center point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To map an absolute anchor point, only the financial resources of the Elves and the Oklahoma era can be done? As far as I know, you have spent one in the South. In the past 100 years, three new absolute positioning points have been set up in Intredon Island, Lower Meiya and Steele! "Zalt's face is incredible and unconsciously stands at the perspective of the Empire. Come and talk, "Your company has only one year of history? Is there two new ones?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nuns also sighed at the side: "We are a few big The church has always wanted to set up an absolute positioning point in the United States and the United States, and it has not been able to make any money and personnel. Light correction of mapping errors and testing are the cost of astronomical figures. Until now, it has only been set up. A high-level ordinary point that is a little farther away from the normal distance and accuracy of the general positioning point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie smirked and took this topic : "In fact, we can not be regarded as an absolute positioning point, but the data is slightly A little more common point of positioning, just happened to get a set of ancient transmission data, the cost is not too big. Of course, purely in terms of business, their value is also great. Every business partner heard that we have ourselves After the secret of the transfer point, the cooperative attitude will become enthusiastic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, pure gold can have its own transmission positioning point and has an independent transmission system that is not subject to the government and the wizard association. Even after the Lenny transfer point has been destroyed, she can reach Interry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder their small underwear business can be so big, so swiftly expanded, and think hard. This is like a businessman in the Age of Elves, claiming that he can control the Senate to form a magical corps at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Annie used the fine gold needle in her hand to engrave the last extra pattern on the gold foil. "The adjustment is complete, just do a mathematical transformation. Without the consent of the Lenny Positioning Point, we can also transfer to the ferry crossing point in the Southern District. There is only a small problem. The area of ​​the public positioning point is not as wide as this. If the two are going, the weight and size of the baggage. There may be some restrictions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much?" Sister Weilen is now asking questions and she has disappeared. "We still have some luggage. Rescued last night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, I think there is only one metric ton limit." Annie replied, "If the two have a magical figure or a heavy firearm like this The baggage may not be delivered. The capacity of the public anchor point is not comparable to our location at Intre."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other three used about half It took only a minute to react: Anne was saying a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister Wilen looked at Anne’s broken arm, removed her gaze and covered her mouth with her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zalt made a few unnatural laughter, which is not commensurate with the shape of his current middle-aged militia officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door did not smile, but gently held Annie's cold, hard left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde girl snorted, biting her lip and forcing her left hand out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it. You guys who don't have a sense of humour, go ahead. Today's ferry is probably very nervous."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, Shangyi Meiya is the largest diocese of our church." Sister Weilun went to the corner and lifted her suitcase. "The gods and their agents will help us. Anne You really don't need help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne shook her head and turned away, leaning against the edge of the table, facing away from others: "No Although there is not enough raw materials and equipment for my soul to transfer to the spare body, I can do this work in Interre. Leisa should have been transported, and it will not bother you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s also true. Even the absolute positioning point can be fixed, the magic of the spare body can naturally be affordable. It is better than forcibly using magical therapy, different sources. The magic will affect the normal performance of your level of magician. I hope you will have it when you meet next time. . Now your commitment "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; nun carrying a small suitcase to Chuansong Zhen central, chic waved to start the transfer magic disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zalt followed the nun to the transmission line. Before he reached the anchor point, he suddenly stopped and turned around and asked suddenly: "I think the mission of the militia divisions is over. Lenny probably doesn't need more defense. Soleil Don't you want to go with us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was only used for a moment, and realized that this might be his last departure from the big quagmire of Lenny. opportunity. He can go to Italy to start life again and re-establish the dream of becoming a rich and ordinary citizen of the Republic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also made the decision in just a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No need. The Liberty Bell is calling me, I am the official officer of the Free Army, and I am resistant to the door. Captain Solerton. I will not leave Lenny. But thank you, teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because only staying, he has the opportunity to get the power he wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne’s thoughts have touched Naomi: Yes, with his credit and Anne’s magic net, he can reverse the situation here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, this huge, warehouse-like room is back to an empty and quiet state again-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only remaining is the door? Sorelton and Anne? Phil two people are facing each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is facing the transfer point, his right hand stays In the state of the return ceremony, it has not been put down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sits halfway at the table, her right hand presses on the left shoulder and closes the fake left arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air is full of embarrassing silence. After the storm, all the lies were exposed, leaving only the uncomfortable transparent air, and everything was at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Wei Lun and Teacher Zalt just passed by chance, but they broke a lot of problems he and she wanted to avoid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was lowered and the arm turned and said: "Annie, I actually have some problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Annie held the table edge and twisted her head and said: "Resist the door, I happen to have some problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and her eyes collided in the air, almost Can knock out the sparks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and she both saw distrust in the eyes of each other. Deception of each other, even if it is only a temporary expediency, or even a deliberate deception, will sow the seeds of suspicion in each other's hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the silence is longer. Both he and her posture have subtle changes: the head of the door is deep down, and Anne's legs are tighter than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Anne opened the silence first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long will we stay here?" she asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know. But we can't wait any longer," he replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we all have a lot of questions to ask, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "The door nodded." "These questions can only lead to more problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annies turned her head and used the corner of her eye to smash it:" Then I have an idea. How do we resolve differences of opinion in the staff department?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The main parties to each point of view have listed their arguments. "Nanmen replied, "Remove all unnecessary explanations, in case the lie of good faith produces more lies, only put the questions and analyze the facts. If you don't agree, don't ask them, just put them aside." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And in the future you will call this tradition 'military democracy'." Anne said that the future vocabulary has no scruples, "I think, this is the solution." The best way to get this deadlock. We really don’t have much time to explain each other. The Lenny Army can make a decision to withdraw at any time. This decision may evolve into advancing, surrendering or falling apart at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree." Resist the door nodded. "So, let's get started."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne coughed and said the usual opening remark: "So, now...Western Army Lenny's Temporary Cluster Operations Conference. The initial spokesperson's position?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. priority."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door said to go to the table and started this only two Personal combat meetings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the name of the Freedom Army, Anne Sefir, I swear that everything I say next is what I think is true. If it is me I can't confirm or don't know what I'm going to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie said the vow of routine business and took off the first cross on her own badge Star, inserted in the ring on the right middle finger. This vow will trigger the magic that is bound to it. After the magic is activated, everyone can only make statements according to their vows. This magic guarantees that all statements must be true, but not necessarily true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Start from the right business. I think, you probably don't need to be busy to replace the body, then we should go to the parliament to report and participate in the reorganization." Namimen suggested, "We can't wait until the parliament has reached a conclusion and then rush. It’s too late.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne nodded and agreed: “The key question is what conclusions the parliament and the Marshal Fox will draw. I am worried that it will be Two conflicting conclusions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is 'withdrawal' and 'sticking'." Nana thought, "with such great encouragement, Members of Parliament will naturally tend to continue to stick to the city. But... As a well-trained soldier, I think Marshal Fox will not judge this. My opinion is, 'Withdrawal.' Lenny is not a city suitable for defense. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How much do you think the loss is, endure?" Anne asked. "I don't know much about the situation of the Lenny Army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was lightly tapped on the table, and the expression on his face was distorted:" It is estimated that we have lost more than 70% of the combat power. Almost all regular military divisions and militia divisions except the South Third District were all defeated, the preparation was completely confusing, and the backbone officers suffered great losses. Lenny's fortifications, Including the west side and the south side, all of them have been systematically and systematically destroyed. The big detection network and the transmission positioning point are not mentioned. The inner three walls that were not damaged have been blasted and the work magic has been destroyed. For the most part, the emperor blew up our defense system with our gunpowder and supplies. And... we have no reserve team, and the empire is afraid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Anne took over this topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is the intelligence of the emperor, I am more clear. They have a reserve team. The main army of the empire has a detachment on the north side, which was supposed to be reinforcements. Jena Blenheim’s double detachment. I can be sure that the best sorcerers and pastors of the empire are in that detachment.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants I thought, added: "Because they have mobilized all the magical powers to defend me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This expression has not allowed the door to end I was surprised. "Understandable judgment. The Empire has only a minimum of magical power in Lenny, so it will be defeated by us last night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let them be scattered into several The group seemed to be a good idea at the beginning.” Annie smiled bitterly. “But now... when they come back, the strength will only be one-third of the previous one. This means that their supply can be extended by three times. The magical power will only be stronger than before. I set up a simple magic net in the battle in the north, I guess the most powerful genius among them will understand the basic working principle of this system tonight or tomorrow. After all, Compared to summarizing the laws of motion from the planetary data, it is much simpler to master the magic network logic from the flow of magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In other words... even if considering To Anne, your strength, we will continue to guard Lenny's odds of less than 50%?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" More importantly, if 'hold on', the Free Army Will retain the existing power structure. We are not only unable to For Lenny's hero, he will also lose all his resources. The power of 'pure gold' is huge for individuals, but for a huge political entity like the Four Republics or the Coman Empire, it is no different. In the glass of water, ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing here, Nana suddenly inserted a sentence: "And, for a captain, he must have a system when the system is chaotic." Opportunity, right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie looked at him with amazement, as if he didn’t expect him to say such a naked word, but still ordered Nod: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door concludes: "Then we have no choice. We must give up Lenny."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The negative impact will be great." Anne made a counter-argument. "First, in a big victory, even if it is a big victory, it will take a very high political risk to abandon the capital. Second Abandoning Lenny means the disappearance of the power base of the entire province. This happened once in our time, and the city of Lenny fell. Later, South Ruslock, Fayce, and even Meyer, who were still resisting, surrendered to the empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was keenly smelling the hidden Content: "Is this the 'future of me'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. From the results, this retains more war potential in the free country. And at the end of the final counterattack, all the emperors in the area were wiped out. But... the premise is that someone is counterattacking. If no one counterattacks, then these war potentials will be invested in the front of the elves and the East. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The real problem is the lawmakers. The lawmakers who still stay in Lenny are a big part of the speculators. Last night these people may still be thinking of being a lord in the empire. Now they will definitely stick to the resistance. This will allow them to take over the power of their acquaintances."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door nodded noddedly: "Unless someone can help former Marshal Fox to suppress the ambitions of those members." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie uses his fingers in the air a little bit: "The man is you, the Western Army's resistance to the door? Captain Solerton, the hero of Lenny's great. You are not Lenny. The soldiers of the army, there will be no bosses in them to take away your credit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is us." Naim corrected, "I have Anne. The merits and strengths, what situation can not be reversed? As long as you make a statement, you can naturally control the Lenny Army. I am sure that every company will be loyal to you, and the former Marshal of Fox will not object."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne shook her head and said, "No, I won't go. I Now this kind of prestige, honestly speaking, is not suitable for the war hero of tragic; the one in your description loses limbs... No, the three limbs, the weak and helpless poor girl is more suitable for the role of the war hero of tragic. To prevent lie detection magic, you can tell the truth to them. I am going to Interre to change my body. Of course, don't tell all the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you go, Anne?" Naomi answered with surprise. "You are the hero who saved the Free Army. I went alone... How do you master the Free Army? Marshal Fox should have reorganized many troops. The school officials there are even more bureaucrats, I can't hold them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have proven yourself, Naimen? Solerton Whether in this history or in my history, you are a hero. Go to the title of 'The Hero of Lenni'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The door suddenly felt a bit dry in the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, would you trust me too much? I am alone..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I trust your ability. As for trusting yourself... it depends on your answers to other questions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie's words Turn, the next question is directed at the core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, I want to know what happened last night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear In this sentence, the door of the forehead began to appear a slight sweat. But Anne didn't intend to stop there. She wanted to ask all her questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to know why when I was still on the road, Sister Willen showed that she seemed to have seen me. I want to know, to the end? Yes? Who received this medal from the hands of Sister Wei Lun?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She poses in front of the military map, her hands are on the table at the same time . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left hand power composed of magic crystal is larger than the average palm, the hardness is higher, and the dull sound is heard on the table, and the door is heard. Trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistance found that Anne has closed all the activity boards on the desktop, and the magic array has been turned into an ordinary desktop, which is more convenient to shoot. Loud noise. He silently walked over to the table and began to state his answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone did come to Sister Wilhelm as you were last night, she is 黛尼卡. After the Jenas defeated her troops, We captured her, but she fled to Lenny through the Lenny transfer point. I don't know why she used your identity, or why she insisted on not coming back. Then I chased her to the book. The pavilion, the result of the emperor’s sneak attack troops. You know everything behind.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie’s expression is as serious as a military meeting. Didn't say she believed or didn't believe it, just asked: "The brooch was given to her by the nun, right. I want to know why it is in your hands."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of the door is also full of confusion. "I don't know. She just left the brooch in the room. I had to use it to pretend to be your military uniform and brooch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resist the door to the table, want to learn Anne to put his hands on the table to increase his momentum, but hesitated or not. He relaxed slightly, held the table with one hand, and tapped his fingers gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, I want to know, your previous fainting, the mouth that said the exit, and the 'this body is already the last'... What does it mean? I I think that should not be what I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he did not have an offensive posture, his question was not lacking in offensiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I should have said that I did not deceive you... This is also true. Everything I said before is true."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie looks as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this statement, Nana couldn’t help but glance at her cross star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised him was that the class stars on the ring did not shine at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is more and more incomprehensible: "It's all true? It's impossible, but this secret base, your fainting, exit, these... all and The scene here is not right.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Awful.” Annie bit her lip. “It’s immoral to force others to show the magic. I have never said that 'the secret base of the welfare home has been destroyed', I only said that 'it is impossible to replace the spare body here.' This is true - because my spare body must be replaced in the Intres Of course, my spare body can't exist so close to the battlefield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was carefully thought back - it was. "Then, those who leave and faint?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All my sentences, the subject and the implied subject are almost all 'body' and 'this body' Ah. 'This body' can't be replaced in Lenny, is there no tomorrow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest is no longer needed by Anne, and the door itself is also Can reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there is a transmission to the Intres.... As long as you don't know this premise, your words can be understood as a tragedy. So you don't Tell me there is a transmission to the Intre. This is really a magic, don't say I don't use lie detection magic, even if I really use lie detection magic, I can't see the truth."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, I have no intention of concealing you. Before we set off, we still need to use this transmission array. In fact, it is more than just a transmission array."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie's sentence raises new questions. Naimeng vaguely guessed the girl's mind in front of him, but still couldn't believe the reasoning result. He must confirm it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to know why you are doing this, Anne? Since it is not for deception, is it for..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne bowed her head and stared at her right hand: "If you have to say something... Is this a test?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Test? About what..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen knows that he knows the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He noticed that Anne’s neck became red again and the whole body seemed to be shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I want to know if you like me or not. By the way, it is my last question."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne jerked her head up and looked straight into his eyes, his eyes clear and clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was silent for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a pretty counterattack, it’s so beautiful, he thinks about the ring of his right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the real purpose of her convening this combat conference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain bowed his head and looked at the cross star on the ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, you should not ask, Annie. You shouldn't ask me this bastard, he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistance? Soledon took a deep breath and said the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this reply, Anne’s eyes immediately went to the door The cross on the right hand floats away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is also my last question, and I want to know if I like you or not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is still saying, his cross star is certainly not bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, I can't make a definitive answer. I used to think that I know what I like. I don't know now. Compared to what I have experienced. Everything... I can't know what I like. I don't know if I am qualified to like you. I don't know if I deserve to be worthy of you. Sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This is totally true. He really didn't know if he liked her or not; he didn't even know who he liked; he didn't even know what he liked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne’s body swayed and the left arm slipped, almost the whole person was lying on the table. She suddenly understood where her biggest mistake was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A young man living in the Age of Enlightenment, who has never read a modern novel, has never heard of a radio, has never seen a TV, and of course he cannot judge "like" Meaning! Stupid! Anne Seifer, you are a fool!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the era of Anne, everyone, both men and women, is familiar with all kinds of The story of love, the bridge of all things, such as a few treasures, all the lines can be a tool for men and women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the case in the world of Naimen Soledon. This is an era of lack of mass entertainment media. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Properly, my next question should be to ask if you like me or not..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The shyness on Annie’s face was as thick as a drop of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...but, what do you like?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the table, the left hand was stretched out with lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His left hand covered Annie’s right hand, covering the aura of the polygraph ring and pulling her in the direction of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne’s body lost its balance, and the overweight crystal arm slammed her body forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a revenge against your designs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is in her ear The whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if this is your trap, I will take care of this bait, Miss Sefer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he pulled her hand forward again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces of the two pose a wonderful angle--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the door? Soledon did not miss this fighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decisively put her lips on her lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a deep kiss, it’s not a slap in the face, a courtesy kiss or a close kiss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you must describe it, it is that you will see the kind of song that is not long or short at the end of the love movie, just enough to finish the theme song. A few key phrases, leaving a long memory and a love kiss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s completely out of the will of the other person, not an accident, it’s not a coincidence, it’s not a trick of fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie couldn’t even figure out how long this kiss lasted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually? How is it actually? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the end of the door ended the kiss, put Opened her right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie’s right hand is so suspended in the air, the body is as stiff as a sculpture, and it will not come back for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knot, end?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, she coughed from her lips These words are out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well. Just stop here, we should stop pursuing these issues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Naomi took the cross star on her ring and set her back on her shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne's face turned into a deep red. Kissed. He really kissed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanmeng this bastard said that he did not know. What kind of test result is this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some men really become too annoying, Annie thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, this sudden kiss...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She grabbed the door of the door with anger Collar, shouted loudly: "Bastard! Bastard! Bastard! Resist you, this bastard! Do you know what you did?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should not be true Angry, Annie?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this sentence, a sigh of anger flashed over Anne’s face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not angry! Don't do this to increase your risk! Don't you know that the kiss before this action is very unlucky? In the theory of film writers, this form of story is called the flag of death!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The flag of death refers to the wilderness The banner of the undead? Why?” The young man who has not seen any modern entertainment works asks, “What does a kiss have to do with their banner?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Annie irritatedly opened his collar and turned his head and explained: "It is not a specific banner, but after the incident, the story behind it will turn into a tragedy. Maybe it is a death." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne bowed her head and stared at the empty desktop, seemingly thinking about something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. This is too unlucky, I have to do something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is Pressed a few times on the desktop, the entire desktop suddenly separated, revealing the complex structure of the magic loop below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, I can really do something. I just said that this big magical array on the ground is not a transmission positioning array. This is what I have not been." Tell you another reason for the existence of this base."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found out." Naimen said, "It is not a transmission point and a matching transmission matrix. The simple law matrix is ​​not so complicated and complicated. It is certainly not the technology of this era."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the basics of using arcane and magic Power, combined with the knowledge of all the magical schools of our time, is probably a good insurance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie put her left hand On the other metal plate that just protruded from the side, the magic blue light passed through the left arm of her crystal, penetrated into the circuit of the desktop, and the magic circuit of the underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or, in other words, it is a miracle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said quietly The right hand draws a magical pattern on several hidden metal plates that appear next to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You may know that in this era, there is a theory of magic that the power of magic comes from the existence of a great power, that is, the root, by the ether. (ether) to pass. They try to develop a theory that can replace all other magic theories, that is, 'universal theory'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In our time, this faction was called the 'rooted school' or the 'Fausian school.' They derived a lot of extension theory, and the radical factions advocated that all other magical theories are hallucinations, and there are many magics. The teacher takes 'reaching the roots' as his own ideal - you have probably seen similar themes and novels. They try to deduce a set of axioms, uniting all the magic into the same logical framework, proving magic, magic All magical and spell-like systems, such as real names, Dongyi, Taoism, and even superpower, have the same origin. But in the end, the etheric theory was falsified by new discoveries and theories in the first half of the 19th century, and you can’t construct A perfect theory replaces all other magic theories. However, the theory and research results they left have become the basis of Magic Net technology."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Crystal And the precious metal engravings began to shine, and the magic array began to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ether theory is not a universal theory, the theory of magic cannot be unified, but we can make all theories public. As long as there is such power, you love trees." How many death flags are erected! Even if the whole story slips into the abyss, we can pull it back from the goddess of fate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ventilation at the top of the room All expanded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ingeniously combined mirrors bring the afternoon sun into this large room, and the dust seems to be accompanied by magic, turning into a tiny color magic cream crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me introduce the 'rootname array' (rootnamearray) and its core composition of 'ether'. If you are too lazy to remember These names can also be called 'artificial miracles'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is holding the breath. Everything around him seems to have a name flashing, but those names disappeared instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He understands that these words represent his understanding of everything in the world; and the flashing text nearby is the extended knowledge he is likely to acquire. He can't see the words all the time, but if he wants to continue to understand, he can follow them to move on to more and deeper knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can coordinate the working rights of the magic net, determine the working form of magic, and authorize the wizard to use the strange magic that he has not even mastered through the magic net. In, you can use my power. More importantly, it can replace the temporary magic net centered on me, turning Lenny's magic net into a permanent, neutral, free and open structure. There is a priest who has the same strength level as me, and it can even build a magic net in the whole world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can this thing be done?" "The door is incredible." This is to say... all the magicians in the world have to learn how to use magic again? This is equivalent to being an enemy of the whole world, too dangerous!"<br /><br />&nbsp "No, it's different from the temporary magic net. The temporary magic net is a world centered on a senior mage, and the etheric net is a network of all senior mages and their world. People can use more powerful magic as a price Their magic is also shared with the people around them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is sucking a cold breath: "That is... no more magical secrets." 'Oh. Our magic is no longer 'Arcane'. As long as you master the method and work hard enough, you can learn any magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Including the magic. My sister thinks that we can't put this magic net up. I used to think so. But I think I should be able to frame it now. The miracle I need has been realized." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne bowed her head and used her right hand to draw a magical array on the table. The blue light source of his left hand is constantly input into the circuit of the magic array, and the whole room is lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because we meet the times, it is already a miracle, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She closes her eyes and opens her eyes, and the color of the magical light in her pupils and arms is constantly changing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the light is blue at first, then green and cyan, then yellow and purple, then orange, and finally red. The seven colors of light make up the rainbow-like beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic is beautiful.
