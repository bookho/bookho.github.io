List of troops. One eunuch and the chief sergeant ran to salute and reported that every time a team was confirmed to return to the team, he wrote a new number in the official document. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troops have taken off the blue old military coat and replaced it with the summer dress in the Steelburg warehouse. The four-color cross flag is still flying in the head of the city of Steele, and the reflection is mapped on the waters of the magnificent Oslo River. Routine, boring, repeated day after day. The huge steel diamonds were particularly dazzling in the summer sun, and he had to bow his head to avoid its reflection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is all over." Nanimen wrote the last number and turned to the commander nearby. "Notify General Eugen, the republic of the Republic of the North Shore has When all is in place, the supply can be completed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody thought that the combat effectiveness of both sides would be so dramatic. Today, the Imperial Fourth Army on the opposite side cannot be called an army. At the beginning, only half of the force was used to defeat the Iron Army of the Twelfth Division. Now there are only the tragic forces that have suffered from several people. The ammunition and grain in the North Shore warehouse are piled up like hills, but there are no ships in the port to transport them. Desperate logistics officers can only hope that the river will sigh. The darkened ships sank in the harbor, and the wreckage and the rainbow of magical light left on the river recalled the miraculous victory of that day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle was about half a month ago. Under the strict command of the emperor, Lieutenant General Tyre of the Fourth Army of the Empire broke through the Freedom Sentinel on the Oslo River and crossed the Oslo River. The low fighting power of these sentinel forces confuses the count's judgment. He led the army to Strasbourg, where he met the first division of the Free Army, commanded by Ega; General Eugen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The balance of winning and losing is immediately reversed. The count led the army to retreat to the Oslo River, where he met a militia that he thought was no longer there. It was not Eugen, nor the operational staff, who commanded this unit, but a southern politician who was despised by the nobility. Under the orders of Colonel Luther and Colonel Luther, the militia and the newly reorganized two regiments left the reserve team position and attacked the ferry across the river. The count paid great attention to the defense there, leaving a whole three camps there - but he couldn't estimate what kind of monster Luther was, and he couldn't estimate what kind of genius he was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A monster that overthrew the old organization, a genius who built a new organization. A decisive battle may only take a few hours, but preparing it requires a lifetime of countless people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther set the church in the army, letting his temporary priests spread magic and tactics in the army, spreading fearlessness and fanaticism. The saints who fought against the elves empire took hundreds of years to succeed, and Pluto; Luther did it in a month with magical techniques, sacred emblems, and various magical items. His army played almost the same combat power as the first division because they would not retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town on the shore was burned. The magician of the Fourth Army of the Empire built a pontoon, but the pontoon was smashed into ashes by the ruling bishop. The soldiers united around the rest of the caster, trying to cross the rushing waters to the other side of the river; the soldiers of Luzer were prepared, and they used the ice stick to shoot freely into the river, producing a lot of deadly ice. edge. Seventy percent of the mighty ferries flowed along the river to the city of Apollo, where the emperors converge on these already stiff bodies. In the deep black despair, Count Tyre led his knights as guards, who shouted the slogan and rushed to the first group of Eugen -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp According to the Imperial Regulations, the deputy commander of the Fourth Army, who was far away from Newcastle, automatically took over the force that had only one-third of the troops. Since then, the Reconnaissance Force of the Free Army has been free to gallop on the north bank of the Oslo River. They intercepted a letter of help from the dozen, and the various specimens of the demon could fill a room. Everything seems to be getting on the right track...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just, there are still some minor problems." Ningmen said to himself. The situation they face is no different from the enemy half a month ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same day they won the miraculous victory, the emperor stood under the city of Lenni. This thing makes all the wins insignificant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sir, the big boss urges you to go back." Jacques; Pierre's voice came. The door turned and turned back to a military ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two people finally decided?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, they haven’t scored a success. The letters from all parties have been very enthusiastic." Jacques Shrugging, "There are too many opinions, and the people who can make decisions don't say anything, so the war continues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really troublesome, I still have a reply. It was delivered with the transport team half an hour ago." The young chief combat officer rummaged through the official document in his hand. "Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they go When the door to the room where the "General Staff of the Steelburg Army" was hung, Nana suddenly realized that the situation had changed a lot. The problem now is not to say no, but to express too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, at the end of the day, we can't use valuable troops to seize some empty cities that have lost their strategic significance, Lord Kegler's Speaker."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord of Lenny, I think your combat plan is too radical. Steelburg is not Fort Fort, the first holy city of Taranto is not Nie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know how many emperors will wait for us, the only politician in charge in history?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know. But I know that our strength is not enough to reach DeLand, it is not enough, double spy officer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The dialogue is full of tit-for-tat, even political scorpions can hear it. Soledon and Pierre stopped at the door and exchanged their eyes in surprise. The two chiefs of this unit did not conduct such provocative discussions in private as usual, but broke openly in front of everyone in the staff! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It won't be because all the troops are there, so showdown?" The door shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think that's the way it is. I'm going to leave tomorrow, but the bosses haven't decided which plan to take."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem of going north or south..." screamed into the staff. The staff members whispered in the corner of the room and were secretly divided into two camps. He quickly hid among them and observed the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eugen stood in front of the map of the Great War Zone, holding a cigarette in his mouth and pointing at a document pinned on the map: "Wiener; Bay General Qi’s letter clearly stated that he wants us to go north. When we threaten Delan, the emperor also had to split up to rescue?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther Sitting on the table without any grace, so that your line of sight can be flush with Eugen. He manipulated a marker pen through magic, which is drawing the route on the map. "The premise is that we can threaten Delan. Delan can pull out more than 100,000 militiamen, and the aristocrats along the way also have private soldiers. No, we can't do it. Klad; General Lopez said in his letter that he would Proposing to the headquarters to make efforts to promote us to the south."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a problem, we can threaten the very holy city of Taranto." Eugen sneered, grabbed After that pen, I drew another marching route. "As long as you have permission from the headquarters, you will accept the plan from the north, Colonel Luther?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" If there is one..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If any."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear Eugen repeated this sentence and insisted on the expression of the bishop. "Don't you really have it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eugen annihilated the cigarette and stood up. "Chief combat staff, should the letter arrive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton coughed: "Well... there is such a letter."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take it." Eugen had already revealed a triumphant smile, and the hand grabbed the letter. His fingers were rubbed over the magical seal, and the self-ignition magic for protection was removed, and the order was taken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His smile is frozen. This time Luther attacked: "How do you say it inside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Marshal said that let us launch an offensive as the case may be, anywhere can be. I clearly analyzed the interests What the old fox is thinking..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone held their breath at the same time: finally someone said this plan. From the time when the two top commanders began to openly argue, people predicted this result. From a historical point of view, the solution to internal contradictions in the military is mostly split or blood-washed, and it is rarely resolved peacefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eugen first smashed it, then took a picture on the military map. "No. We only have 30,000 people. The division is self-seeking. In addition, the remaining supply is not enough for the two armies to act separately. We lost 70% of the reserves half a month ago. It’s not enough at the same time to attack both cities.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther also stood up and walked to the map. "Then you can't attack the city. Isn't it okay? There are so many undefended villages on the rich Soma Principality and the South Coman Plain. A small and elite army can survive in it, and it can't be built in the attack on Lenny. The merits. Leave the siege equipment to our south detachment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turned out to be a guerrilla fan, have you seen more about the history of the War of Independence?" Eugen is not angry and laughing. "It’s really light. Do you know how many base equipment is needed for a long-term guerrilla unit? If I want to implement your strategy, I must pick the most elite 10,000 people from the Republic’s division. Take all the grain, horses, light equipment and magic items. All you have left is the grain and siege weapons... You need to use this to rescue Kengler and challenge the Imperial Second Army there!! Unless there is God The blessing contract of personal guarantee is only!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther suddenly applauded, and the loud applause echoed in the room. This weird action silences everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, the deal. You take what you want, and leave it to me. I swear in the name of the bishop."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You only need 20,000 people plus their grain and siege equipment to deal with the Second Army? Are you sure? This is death, I declare in advance. No one wants to follow you south. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's all I want. I have a blessing contract that God personally guarantees." Luther turned and faced all the staff's claims. "You can voluntarily join the North or South detachment. Is it going to compete for merits in the north, or to defend the hometown in the south? It depends on you. I am waiting for you tomorrow in the starting team..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, don’t take out the politicians who lie to me!” Eugen interrupted Luther’s speech. “I always feel like I’m on you. , Colonel... Then everyone makes a decision today, the North detachment, the South detachment or staying behind, the meeting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;"But this showdown is too fast. I want to split up, what are you thinking about? This violates all strategic guidelines." Ningmen whispered to himself, the volume just happened to make Anne around. Hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne snorted: "Come with me, explain to a secluded place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fort Stilt is a fortress that can accommodate 100,000 people. Even if the entire Stilburg Army is busy preparing for the expedition, there are many people in the alleys. Anne and Nani followed the path of no one and walked aimlessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is it possible to be more secluded? The pub is not good, and now it must be all human." Annie said on the small stone on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Church, there should be no one now." Nana was hesitant to start asking questions from there. "It’s finally the last day. Sacrifice so many people, we Only then, I will leave here. I will leave now. The fortress will become very empty tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie’s finger, projecting a fortress on the gray wall Map to find the nearest church. "There are two or three thousand left-behind troops, and they won't be in space."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you really want to give up Steelburg and rescue Lenny? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne turned her face. "I remember you should have read the draft of the 'Morning Defence', Soledon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. That plan looks perfect. It Essentially, the enemy is put in first, until their supply line is fragile, and it is no longer possible to retreat, and then mobilize the forces to destroy them, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although simple, you are right." Annie nodded. "At least Admiral Lopez said this to us. His army should be preparing for the attack now. We must cooperate with his offensive."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds quite reasonable." Annie laughed. "Actually, I agree with you. If you talk about risk, it must be safe for the North Branch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No, I don't mean this. I just want to know your judgment..." Namenton paused and added a superfluous addition. "I think it might be more appropriate to talk to you about this issue."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, do you think it is too awkward to talk to Luther about this problem?" Anne's rumor only refers to the core of the problem, and the threshold is touched. Before he even thought of an excuse, Anne had stopped. "Come on, go in and talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the door as she walked into the church, sat down on the top bench. Everyone at this time was busy with their work, no one came to the church; the pastors were also included in the starting team. Annie pulled out a thin map and spread it on the preaching platform. "Look at this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lines of the various colors on the map are dazzling. He quickly recognized that this was a deductive record: time and scribbled notes were found near the arrows that were mobilized by each of the troops. There are two fonts on the annotation, the delicate blue italic and the black rough font. The owner of the black character is mobilizing the emperor. He found eight opportunities to fight back near Kengal, and the blue word tried to resolve these threats through various efforts. He guessed the masters of the two handwritings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two of them have been played? Why do they break?..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They I can't convince the other person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, this deduction record shows that it is more dangerous to go to Kengal than to enter the Imperial territory? I don't believe Luther and you. It’s someone who will go to the dead.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come? You see, the empire is like a long snake on our land, Kengg Le is obviously the key to the snake.” Anne’s eyes flinched and escaped his gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The key to the snake is precisely the most rigorous position to be protected. The Emperor will never allow Kengal to fall for the third time. Even I can Seeing that the city was under too much pressure. Once Kengler was lost, the 60,000-strong army that surrounds Lenni could not be replenished. It is impossible to seize the city by 20,000 troops without supply." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But if so?" Anne's hand caught all the emperors west of Kengal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was slightly surprised and hesitated: "Can this be done?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Hopefully... Sorry, this is something I shouldn't have known, so I can't say more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can do it, the enemy The supply line will be cut off. But can we really do it? Even if it does, will the emperor have no solution? I don't believe that he will let his precious magical power to make grain, make water, make artillery shells...呃Sorry, wait a minute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A somewhat ridiculous thought suddenly flashed into his mind. "I think of one thing. Will the emperor use the navy to provide supplies to continue fighting? You know, there will be places on the coast of Interlake and Imeia that are willing to provide supplies to the emperor."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie "snapped" and laughed. "Navy? The imperial navy who dared to glory in Lu Xinhai? They didn't even dare to hang their own flags. They all hanged the elf flag and tried to escape the hunting of our fleet. This is unlikely, Soledon?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not very clear about the navy." The door is hot on the face, "but if they hang the elf flag in order to meet somewhere? They put the boat Come out, always have purpose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie smiles and considers this possibility with interest. "Well, this sounds very reasonable. I know that someone who is familiar with the Elven Navy is monitoring all the large and small fleets in the South Sea. Maybe I should tell him about this possibility, let him pay attention, so the Red Fleet will There was a reaction time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took out the notepad and took off a piece of paper and wrote down the matter on it. After fixing the yellow ribbon with the spell, she sealed it with her own ring. Then, her magic evokes a cute wind fairy, letting it take this note to find someone who can send it away. After finishing all this, Annie blinked and patted the shoulders of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word "prize" allowed the door to swallow. What can he ask for? What will she give? a kiss? Or a valuable gift? He thought about it and picked one that he really wanted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to know the true intentions of Lord Luther. Otherwise, I decided to go to the North Detachment, which is safer."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne's breath stopped. "How do you guess... No, I can't tell you this. If you are interested, go back and check out the Magic Combat Manual, Chapter 12 of the attack. Change one."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Change one...do you have a bar? I know you should have it today." The door was a bitter smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Open the wine." Anne untied the button in the red summer dress and rummaged through the magic mark in the inner pocket. The door was accidentally caught in her underwear and hurriedly turned her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's black, with lace stitched by hand..." he thought in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, here. Take it back and sneak it out, this ratio should be sent tomorrow." Annie pulled out five bottles of red wine and placed it on the sacred preaching desk. On, turn around and go. Somehow, the door-to-door ghost reached out and took her hand and pulled her wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, let me have a few drinks, Anne. Just as a screening, I will go to the North Detachment."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way. Are you going north?" Annie stunned and picked up the bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magical appearance is the wine set, which was originally a silver button set on her cuff. She is a natural logistics expert, and no one can guess how much mysterious thing she has brought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I prefer beer, but red wine is also good. I don't know why, all the extra rations on the opening day are red wine."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You haven't heard of it?" Resistance lowered his head and stared at the deep red wine in the cup. The silver goblet was bigger and deeper than expected, and he saw his reflection cast on the black-red wine. "The red wine on the opening day represents blood. The soldiers believe that drinking a lot of red wine can increase their blood volume, allowing them to continue fighting with the wounds, and support the pastors to keep up. This is my logistics in Fort. I heard that, we drunk the reserves there for ten years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this superstitious? No matter how good the wine can not become Blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door touched the glass of her hand with the edge of her silver cup, and sipped it. "Actually, everyone knows this. Wine is just grape juice, not anyone's blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone knows, but no one says it There are a lot of things." Annie muttered to herself, and also drank the wine in her hand. “Everyone knows that there are many loopholes in the plan. Everyone knows that each arrow represents a terrible sacrifice and a horrible battle. Everyone knows that one plan cannot be expected to make no mistakes.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not drunk?" Naomi asked a little worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible? This concentration of red wine, want to get drunk without distilling? Wait two hundred years." Annie provocatively put the two men's cups Everything is full, "Say, the plan with a lot of loopholes is stronger than nothing. No matter what you do, the world may change because of it; but if you don't do anything, nothing will change."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This sentence is really good, but I seem to have heard it? It’s too convincing that your age is such a thing." After retorting, "Sometimes your tone and my teacher, Clade; Lopez is very similar...but that is an uncle who has been wandering in the East for more than ten years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who do you say like Uncle?" Anne's face was slightly red, angered. She gently rotated with her index finger, middle finger and thumb to play with a silver cup, with a sly smile on her face and opened the subject. "In any case, I think we can win."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young lieutenant sighed and lost. "How long will it take? In front of us, I don't know how many hard battles there are. To be honest, I have never missed the peaceful life of half a year as I do now. Maybe in the near future, I will miss this in Steelburg. Duan peace life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie was mocking, but with a hint of admiration in her tone, but the door was not heard. He looked down at his chest without a medal and shook his head and smiled: "I just think that I will not die so easily, but you... I know that your magic level is good, but things don't always look like I’ve never been lucky. I know, so I won’t go to the South with you this time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Thank you for your concern "The blonde girl licked her lips and picked up the bottle." The first bottle had already bottomed out. As soon as she pointed her finger, the cork of the second bottle flew into the sky and slammed into the statue in the church. "However, I am also a high-ranking mage. I can judge what kind of occasion I can handle. Your choice is correct."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Does anyone seem to say that I am confident that there is a surplus? High-level Master?" Nana's mouth sneered and raised. Alcohol is a wonderful thing that unleashes his true feelings. He is no longer worried about anything. "Death is never in anyone's options. It's a fate, just like a natural disaster, we can only reduce it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Annie browed and wanted to continue the fight, but accidentally noticed the eyes of the door. There is no taunting smile in his eyes, but a thick indifference. It is the indifference that is suppressed under training, jokes and carnival on weekdays. The real veterans are indifferent to the battle before they are indifferent to themselves and to the enemy's life. This look made her breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past six months, I have witnessed too many ugly deaths, no one is voluntary... I remember the one in the Battle of Kengal At night? You told me that night, your goal is to make people who are still alive better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course." Blonde girl blinked "I won't forget them. This is my debt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's mine too. I have no ability to promise to make living people better. Because even my own future is very unclear. But I can fight alongside people who are still alive." He took a deep breath and said the answer he found. "I will do my best to make you and more." People see the coming of the final victory. If the god of death really wants to meet me, I will smile and receive it, and that’s it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ......" Anne is obviously already drunk, "After you laugh... Maybe... maybe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp; "Handsome?" Under the influence of alcohol, the door is also a bit interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...may be a little better luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny grabbed the second just opened Bottle of wine, stood up silently. The sunlight through the stained glass windows at the top of the church is colorful, and it turns into a warm crimson through the bottle. She stared at the bottle for a long while, and suddenly he did not hesitate to pour the bottle. The good wine poured out and poured out the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What a great ambition. Smile and meet the god of death? Don't be kidding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, what?" The door-to-door, which was shocked, looked up and stared at Anne unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde girl swayed and said in a word: "Don’t talk about death easily, because you never know what will happen next. We can... no We will definitely win. If you can't live that day, isn't it too bad?! When life comes to victory, Soledon... promise me. Even if you have to endure humiliation, you have to survive." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it’s dull, like Soledon, I’ve heard the good feelings in this passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You drink too much, Anne?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and grabbed her The shoulders and wrists have won the bottle. He is almost the same height as her, and when they face each other, their eyes and lips are inevitably very close. Her wrist is far greater than he imagined, but she did not resist hard. The impulse of instinct rushed into his heart, and the boy kissed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as his lips felt the other's body temperature, the rusted door shaft suddenly creaked. He and her at the same time removed their gaze, stepped back and panicked at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that some people are very uneasy before the troops leave. Are you two on a date?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You actually drank three whole bottles? Are you a casks? Do you know that you are going to leave tomorrow? You two..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Annie glanced close to him. She slammed Bonnie's cheek, and the glass in her hand reached the mouth of her sister at a speed that was hard to capture with the naked eye, and poured it down. "Don't say that. This is the last day. Isn't this the tradition of the Free Army?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough... Annie, you!" Bruto pushed the glass open, but the automatic counterattack magic on his body had already been activated. A thin circle of white light was unfolding around his thin body. This powerful force pushed Anne and the door open a few steps. The preaching platform and the chair in the front row were also crushed by this force. The bottles all flew up and slammed into the stained glass. They smashed together and the smile on Annie's face solidified with the broken bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's all four or seven years of red wine. There are only five bottles in the depths of the wine cellar! How do you pay for me, Pluto? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blond girl's body emits a rare momentum, and the palm of the hand is heavily photographed on the preaching platform, and the preaching station has cracked. The part of the door that was not paralyzed by alcohol immediately updated the previous estimate of her wrist strength - even if it is an orc, it may not be able to crack the 20-year-old preaching platform. There are only a handful of men in the world who can overwhelm her with force - he suddenly feels a little scared. Obviously, Luther thought so too, and his momentum would be embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it's such a precious wine, don't put it out together... forget it, what do you want me to do?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s better to have a drink with us when you are drinking alone?" When Anne squinted and said this familiar line, the corner of the door was uplifted. . He knew that Colonel Luther had no room for resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then this little drink will expand. Anne did not happen like anything, and she took out ten bottles of wine for four or nine years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is strange is that as these wines disappear, the people in the church are gradually increasing. The security officer who came to find Luther to handle the official duties had the longest tentacles, but the intelligence of the staff and the rest of the logistics department was as sensitive as they were. The security officer got the news, and the arrival of General Eugen, who chewed the gum, was also a matter of course. Some people come to some instinct, such as his patriotic adjutant; and some... some of them can't tell, such as an organist who is sleeping on a bench, and Nami does not even know when she is. Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the door finally reacted to prepare a few heads, the little church was already filled more than the prayer. The bottle was thrown all over the floor, and he didn't know if Anne's wine inventory was drained by everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He even forgot how he struggled back to the dormitory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hangover continued until the next morning. The door that endured the headache sat up and suddenly found the "Magic Warfare Handbook" on the bed. He remembered Anne's words and opened the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Attack articles, Chapter 12... Hunting Dragons Code of War? Original..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He suddenly understood and struggled to run out of the door and rush to the assembly point of the troops. He found the logistics officer of the unit and patted her shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can I not think about it, why are you still so energetic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Soledon? You should be in the North Detachment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I changed my mind. I still want to be bigger than the easy-to-get small credit. ..." He lowered his voice. "Count me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie laughed. "I know you will come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I still have some questions... Why are there so many carriages here?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the agreement, the supply of carriages belong to the North Detachment, they account for 80% of all supplies... It should be like this. As a combat staff member, Naomi is well aware of the supplies that Anne has given him every day. He knows where magic items and ammunition are scarce. But what is in front of him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
