The two cross-shaped main roads that cut the whole city are called “Central Avenue” and “Central Avenue”, with these two roads as the coordinate axes. The remaining roads are “East One Street” and “North Third Avenue”. name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, this year's cotton market is really good. How much profit, slave b?" When it comes to profitability, Reza is very happy and comfortable. In the trading market, all the cotton was shot, and then the rented carriages and caravans were returned to the chain car dealership. The hard work of the journey finally turned into the gold in her cash box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Deducting the cost, about 2,000 pounds." Bonnie, who has become her exclusive accountant; Sefer mentally calculated and got a Probably the result. Unlike the appearance, Bonnie - or Melia Yana - has more than 10 years of practical experience, even if it is a casually reported number, it is basically inseparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this amount, Reshua whistled; the two men following her, each with different expressions on their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"2000 Union Pound, which is 200 white gold coins? Merchants are really good to earn." Only one month can get 1 platinum coin salary When the elf's former sea otter heard this number, he felt a little bit depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kazmi heard this sentence and patted him on the shoulder: "In fact, there is not much money, we make a big business, than this It’s much more earned.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “No wonder the pirates are killing...” Leonard couldn’t help but have some doubts about his previous life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think about changing jobs? You have already been kicked out by the Elf Navy. Even though my ship is sinking, it's not hard to do it again... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, the former pirate captain, when he persuaded him, met the sharp eyes of Reza, and immediately fled. In his memory, the strength of this woman is enough to force him to use the vacuum three times a day for a continuous period of time. He has not had the guts to violate her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, noble lady, finally ended the journey, do we want to find a place to celebrate?" Anne spoke in time to save Katzmi Come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s also true." Resa thought for a moment. "Everyone has worked hard for a long time. You have to find out where the best hotel is, Anne?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, Anne; Sefer returned with the answer: "The 'Sunshine' in the West Third Section of Central Avenue is said to be the best local restaurant . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So let's go! "Leiza waved her hand and issued an order that could not be disobeyed. However, to receive these former desperados is not a good news for "Xi Zhao"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After about two hours, the sky is already dark.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The evening sun" is located in the West Third District, not far from the United Parliament Building. Whoever you ask, they will tell you that the 20-year-old "Sunshine" is the best restaurant in Lenny.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the door, it looks dazzling : At least eight colors of light are shot from the corners of the nearby streets and gathered on the huge signboards to create a dark orange sunset. The huge glass floor-to-ceiling windows and glass revolving doors are amazing enough; Say, “This restaurant looks like a crystal palace that the legendary gods used to enjoy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this crystal palace was squandered by a group of hairs this evening. The barbarians captured.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About twenty The young man with a ragged, disgusting look is spread over more than a dozen tables in the lobby of this high-end restaurant. He has no appreciative manners and graceful grasp of various high-class dishes. The fine dining restaurant has become a cafeteria. The middlemost table was made into a ring, and the main dish, appetizers, desserts, soups were mixed together, all in large pots, placed on the table for the barbarians to use at will.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the melody of the songs to each other, even more out of tune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collision sound of the wine glass is mixed in between these sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, no one but anyone else has eaten. The culprit causing all of this, the "golden alchemist and his servants", a group of people sitting in the remote corner of the restaurant, enjoy this cheap and cost-effective food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reesa; the clothes chosen by Hermonte are still shining in gold. As usual, today's pure gold alchemy masters are not interested in all kinds of dishes, just lit a cigarette, discreet red wine, boring gaze into the distance Kazmi and his front under the opening " A manly banquet." Former naval officer Leonard; Kikawi has had some lack of energy since he landed, but he sat silently next to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spell the long breath of smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A buffet will cost five hundred pounds, will you say it will be a little expensive, Bonnie?" One thousand pounds at a time, Leisha slightly Feeling painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The restaurant of this grade should be normal...hey." In the mouth, Bonnie, who had seen the menu, turned his head and vomited quietly. Spit your tongue. First, the fierce Kazimierz pirate group and the huge golden golem rushed into the store, and then Leisha and the golden light appeared on the scene. The clerk of "Xizhao" had already been scared enough; at this time, a look was made. The very warm half-elves raised the "500 gold coin buffet?", the clerk naturally rushed to take it as a life-saving straw, and couldn’t care if the price was too low. If you really want to calculate the recipe, so many people can eat and how to get more than two thousand gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's normal...that's it. It looks like it's time to think about making a fortune..." Resa sighed, it seems I feel a little sorry for not being able to save more money. She rolled another cigarette, and the table fell into cold again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne turned her head boringly, and saw several people standing at the door of the store, worrying about the reality of becoming a buffet restaurant. However, this time these guests were different from those of the previous guests, and one of them was very eye-catching and attracted her attention in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a middle-aged man with a cold face and a deep-eyed face, wearing a blue military uniform of the Free Army, giving a considerable sense of oppression. Whoever sees it will admit that he is a born soldier. On his shoulders, there are two gold star decorations, plus a silver cross mark; the trim on the side of the shoulder is white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie also noticed him, and grinned in surprise. Her mouth didn't open, but her sister could hear her voice: "The Major General? No, there are special signs. Not only the Major General..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It should be... oh..." Annie grabbed her hair and thought about it, using the same mind to communicate magic. "I have just seen it in history books two days ago. White seems to be a central army directly under the jurisdiction..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also remembered. The Silver Cross is a temporary rank, indicating 'actually leading the troops', in order to distinguish it from ordinary honorary generals. It is like... 呃, Oriental empire All the local officials are the same as the word 'right'. It is a kind of tradition. He is a temporary lieutenant who led the Central Army..." Bonnie tried to think back, "...now, the temporary officer in Lenny should only have Two people only."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which two?" Anne asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There should be only two troops assigned to the military by the Joint Council. The two commanders should be Clade; Lopez and Dico; Lyme Da." Bonnie answered with certainty, "...the latter should be a temporary major, then the former."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crad? Lopez? Are you sure? Is it the same as Gustav; Hugh; the emperor of Coleman?" Anne’s telepathy was trembled and her face changed slightly. Even if she relies on the history books to make up the lessons from time to time, she also knows the name of this person. She was so excited when she could see such a big man with her own eyes - just as she saw Leisa for the first time; Hermont and Leonard; when Kikawi was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm sure...this is Clade; Lopez." After that, Bonnie fell into meditation. Annie felt that she was thinking about the problem and didn't bother to know it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be advising them to leave." Anne snickered, she had seen at least 20 guests seeing the situation inside and turned away, and 10 were advised to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of her expectations, the middle-aged people did not retreat, but pointed their fingers at the direction they were in, laughing and saying something. The waiter stunned and promised. Without the use of magic to enhance listening, Annie can guess what he said: it must be a noblemanship such as "Since women have the guts to leave, why don't we dare to eat here". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also guessed another fact: the waiter did not dare to tell the lieutenant the true face of this seemingly harmless guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, she was free to pay attention to the two people behind the lieutenant. The first person, wearing a black robe, looks quite old, but is estimated to be no more than thirty-five years old; this person's gaze lacks Clade; Lopez's wind and sorrow. The second one is a small black-haired boy with a narrow eye. His eyes are shackled and he is always yawning, giving him a feeling of no spirit. It should be a lazy young mage who is too tired to exercise and feels tired with a little magic, Anne thought. She used to be such a mage before, delicious, lazy, sleepy... although these points seem to be the common occupational diseases of young women two hundred years later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of curiosity, as a super-magic expert, she silently sent a silent magic probe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A layer of gray filter descends from her retina, and the brightness of the outside world symbolizes the strength of magic. In this era, most wizards do not deliberately hide their magical aura, this magic is still quite effective in detecting magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shiny silver tableware should be in the gray field of view, just a black environment decoration. The magic candle used for lighting is just a shimmer. The table is dark and the crystal turntable placed on it is slightly magical - it is estimated to be a small effect such as automatic rotation. She nodded with satisfaction and the effect was not wrong; then she focused her attention on each person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She and her sister are wearing pure black armor, and the body is faintly shimmering under the influence of anti-detection magic - in fact, they are two It should have been shining. Leisha; Hermonte's whole body equipment exudes the light of ordinary brightness, and the alchemist is slightly brighter than the equipment on his body. The half-elves themselves did not seem to have any magical repairs, and the stilettos were somewhat shiny. The magical aura of the boy is as worthless as his appearance. The black robe of the black robe is also black in the field of view, and the magical power of his own body is only slightly lower than that of Reza. As for the Clade; Lopez...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged soldier’s body has no light at all; rather, the faint light of the two of them Almost the same. Anti-detection, Annie thought. She was slightly disappointed: this would not determine the strength of the opponent's magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedestrians came in the direction they were in, and the black robes and teenagers also noticed them. When she saw her and her sister, their eyes were clearly bright; Anne felt that her precious self-esteem was stretched out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After they were seated, the caller’s fingertips sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the opportunity of the waiter, Reza also called a bottle of wine. The first bottle of wine has caused a flush on her cheeks. "...Speaking, Anne, you seem to have mentioned the problem of opening a store before? What store is open?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, inside, underwear store..." There were strangers behind him, Anne; Seifer said, lowering her voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Underwear? What is that?" Reza had some puzzles. "Are you talking about shirts or petticoats? Can such things make a lot of money?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, not a shirt or a petticoat, but something different..." Annie hesitated and thought about how to explain this "transcendence." The invention of the times." “For example, bras, underwear, garter socks, and things like swimwear.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza looks even more puzzled: “Brassier? Panties ?? Stockings??? Swimwear???? What are you talking about, Anne?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...this...the bra is... ..." Anne stuttered and couldn't pick up the words of Reza for a while; fortunately, she had a very strong sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, these are nuns?" The alchemist interrupted her and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh... this?...yes...." Bonnie quietly apologized to the word "nun" in her heart. She feels that she may be unforgivable about history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute?" Resa sank. "Are you not out for a tour tour? Why are you so enthusiastic about making money? Are you really? What kind of rehearsal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Manny's retreat." The two sisters had a common answer, "The purpose of our rehearsal is Relying on money to do justice. By relying on money to do justice, we can carry out the will of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rely on money to do justice? I also want to join. "Lisa's body explored and smothered the smoke. I asked with interest: "Show me your 'repair uniform', is there something real?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... wait a minute..." Annie turned and made an action that was rummaged through the rough bag. She quietly meditated on a magic, ready to temporarily make a bra out as a sample. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me introduce myself first." This voice is without a doubt Krad; Lopez. His voice is very low, with a magnetic temperament. "My name is Clade; Lopez, Liberal Army Major General, Temporary Lieutenant. Thank you for your care of the little girl for many years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intensively listen, Or eavesdropping on the four people he spoke - two men and two women - at the same time turning the same thought: we already knew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't dare to make it. The talent of Qianjin is too high... I don't miss the children, I thank God. My ability to collect magic and intelligence. I want the highest respect; the guy who can't accomplish anything is far from it." The voice is very gloomy, but it seems to be a gloomy deliberately. It is about the voice of a black robe man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I say this, I am not even more useless. In order to pursue my blind ideals, my wife is sick and dead, even my daughter, do not want to recognize my father... ...ha." The sound of liquid flowing into the throat. "This... is also retribution. What is ideal, what ambition..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This..." After a moment of silence, the voice of the black robe man rang again. "However, my incompetent mage has taught her for so many years, and she knows her character too much. It is difficult to change the things that make a lot of money... Is it, Soledon?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "Sorlayton" is about the name of the humble boy? Annie thought, as weak as his sense of existence, a name that was hard to remember - she almost forgot it in a flash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...the things she decided, almost never changed. I grew up with her and I can’t understand it." His voice and Like his appearance, he is drowsy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a long silence. It sounds like Klad; Lopez's past is quite painful, not only his wife, but his daughter refuses to recognize him... Anne feels some sympathy and whispered to her sister: "Is there any strings later? How is her daughter?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie frowned and thought back: "I haven't seen Clade; Lopez passed... but there seems to be a mention of him in the history book. The middle-aged wife lost her wife."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well..." Anne seems to be quite touched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, I think he still can't use your sympathy. If you even Klad, Lopez must sympathize, I am afraid you have to sympathize with this age percentage The ninety-nine people." Seeing her sister and revealing the expression "I want to be a savior", my sister hurriedly reminded me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous pouring, drinking, pouring, drinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really not me. Say these things... make everyone very jealous. Come, come, drink!” Klad’s voice, then the first The sound of the secondary glasses hitting each other. "Right, when are you going to propose to the nun? 'My brother, Mr. Ninmen...hey, or Mr. Fran? She should have never announced a true life-long vow."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He... what did he say?" Anne; Seifer's hand trembled, the golden lace bra in her hand fell underground, and she even forgot to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This name. This name. this person. this person. Her pulse is speeding up, like a wild horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s true that the door is right, men. The ancient Elvish means 'no such person'." Bonnie clasped her hand. Stopped her body from involuntarily shaking and calmly confirmed it. "It's that person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Which one?" Annie asked with a last hope, "Which one was talking...?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impossible. impossible. This is an illusion. This is an illusion. Not an uncle. It shouldn't be uncle... Her heart beats fiercely, and her thoughts beating as the heart beats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie tried to make a blank expression: "Well, unfortunately, it should be the uncle. The boy is unlikely to be the younger brother of Lopez." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you look like 16?" If this is a nightmare, wake up. If this is a fictional world, then dissipate it...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If his son is 16 years old, I would not feel very strange."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe... is it a coincidence? He may not be that person...? He just said 'Mr. Fran'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, of course it is very likely to be a coincidence. However, logically, it is not impossible, for example, the original name is 'Neimen; Fran', and then got the surname." Bonnie for her Completed the golden garter and gold one-piece swimsuit and handed it to Reza. “Respected lady, we found a new uniform. You can give it a try.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alchemist took the whole set with doubts The uniform of the seminar," looked at it. “Looks like it’s made for me? Is it too much to use with such a piece of fabric?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie’s “snap” "This uniform is worn under the outer garment, just like wearing a corset and a waist when wearing a leather armor. However, it is more comfortable than a corset and a waist. Two sets of uniforms, one is usually worn. One set is used for swimming and bathing. The latter set is characterized by no transparency even if it is stained with water."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Oh." Resa stared at the cloths for a moment, and finally made up her mind and stood up. "So, how do you wear these things? I will try it on now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, the half-elves who are drinking, have been drunk The son was provoked by the association, and the whole body almost fell on the table. He hurriedly said: "This, Ms. Hermont, this kind of clothes... at least... at least it should be covered?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are thinking What, Mr. Kakawi?” Retha gave him a cold look, and the right elbow squatted on the back of the half-elf. The unfortunate half-elf picked it up and huddled on the sofa. The alchemist did not care for him. He pulled Bonnie down to the corner of the wall and created a temporary locker room with deformation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the shape of the object changes. The sound of the curtain turning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t peek!" Bonnie snarled from the locker room. So, next to the table, there was only Kikawi who continued to drink and Anne, who had never been able to look up; Sephiel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible...Impossible...this is all fake...not the old cows eating the grass...and he has to propose to others ?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde girl is covering her head, and countless thoughts are spinning in my mind. I don't know why, she can easily accept the undead monsters of more than two hundred years old, but it is difficult to accept the uncle in his thirties - even more unacceptable to the uncle who is about to get married. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why... Why does she feel so resistant? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it... her love for him is not unconditional? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
