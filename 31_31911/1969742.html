			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The gravel is thrown to the "Butterfly in the Storm"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;七曜之牙<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the high school era, I used to borrow the first half of the "Blood Blood Rose" in the rent bookstore. Now I still want to miss it. Before and after, borrow at least three times. From a novel, "GBR (GUN-BLOODROSE-NECROMANCER)" is undoubtedly a very interesting thing, and as the sequel, "Butterfly in the Storm" is also the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first volume of the article, necroman made the two sisters who were the real protagonists out in a rather covert way. I have to say that his technique Quite clever. The incomprehensible part of the previous scenes caused the effect of “Wow! The original author’s foreshadowing was so brilliant” at the moment of identity disclosure. "Unexpected, reasonable," I would like to use this sentence to describe it as appropriate. At the same time, the author's ability to grasp the structure also makes me lament: the routine of "going back to the past" has been quite widespread in today's online novels. However, under the author's settings and skills, this setting itself constitutes a suspense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a web work, Butterfly is undoubtedly excellent. However, its implication is not that it has no flaws at all - in fact, this novel also contains a lot of shortcomings. The enthusiasm for setting has largely contributed to Butterfly, but in the same way, it is constantly damaging the expressive power of the novel. The interpretation of the scene, regardless of the scene, can indeed solve the reader's doubts and maximize the audience to show this interesting and wonderful world - but the problem is that these explanations can also turn a very good feature film into the DISCOVERY Discovery Channel. 》. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe we should return to the first volume. As a link between GBR and Butterfly, this volume did not revolve around the Quillahiya sisters. Undoubtedly, this technique is a good guarantee for the rhythm of the work, and it is also an important part of the separation between Butterfly and GBR. But the author seems to have gone too far on this road. The first chapter of the first volume focuses on the struggle between the two peoples on the New World, and at the same time leads to the important figure of Reza. Other than that? No more. The two different cultural representatives who occupy important plays here are hanging out in this chapter, and then do not seem to have much effect. The plot of the present seems to have no connection with the following texts, and it has no effect on deepening the shaping of characters. On the whole, the introduction of this war drama can indeed express the small theme of cultural conflict, but it is a waste of ink for the big theme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another shortcoming in Necroman's writing is the lack of a grasp of the big scene. Controlling individual characters is pretty good, but when it comes to writing large-scale battles, it seems to be powerless. One-on-one combat is quite visible, but once it involves a real big scene such as a cavalry charge, there is always something missing. In the words of some unsatisfactory words in memory, it is "a master fight, pull tens of thousands of cannon fodder to accompany the death, and set off the atmosphere by the way." For the unknown soldier, the author does not seem to waste time on them... so cannon fodder Their achievements are at best only as a stage set. Basically, most of the sensational feelings in the book are static scenes such as poetry and "post-historians". The description of the battlefield chill is always lacking in appeal, so the cannon ash is more than a number. This lack of appeal is in line with its predecessor, "The Gun Blood Rose." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A major feature of current online novels is that the protagonist is invincible. Around the circumference of the king's gas, the pig's feet with a group of younger brothers killed God and killed the Buddha... Of course, necroman did not set his protagonist as an invincible superman. If you do this, I am afraid that the novel will not progress anymore. However, from the plot so far (including GBR), the author often repeats such a routine: the protagonist upgrades with the enemy upgrade, the enemy that appears every time is always one or several levels lower than the protagonist, just eaten dead. . The feeling that everything is in control is certainly good, but it is boring every time. When the FSS is still in the sky and there is a loss of power, the protagonist occasionally encounters a situation where he can't make a handsome POSE. It will be interesting to think about it. The result of shaping an overly powerful protagonist is usually the general paleness of the surrounding characters. In the second half of <GBR>, in fact, this tendency has begun to become serious. In the "Butterfly", the Quillahiya sisters do not have a large enough stage to use their own power - so I keep my opinion on whether the author will make this mistake again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last is a question. “Faith becomes power” seems to be the rule of the GBR world, so why do you find it difficult to use uninvented spells? The words spoken by Naimen in the previous work can be used as a clue... "There must be someone who believes in you." Here, or it can be said that "you must have someone who believes in this spell." Can the belief of others be the power to support the magic net? Or is it purely a force of time and space? In fact, I am quite looking forward to the correct answer given by the author. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Necroman's comments in 2005-02-1520:09:12 may be unhelpful... If you set more, it will become a good one. (Sweat) I thought that I also despised Yongye Huo and Shiliang Authentic, but then I enjoyed it myself. One of the characteristics of setting madness is to require "inner logic completeness", so setting the characteristics of a city is to set the nearby terrain, set the terrain to set the history, set the history to set the organization. Set the organization to set the strong... After setting it, it is unlikely that it will be used without any preparation, and then the inexplicable explanation will increase the length of the description. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the issue of "the strong control of everything", the author is introspection after writing GBR. Therefore, this time the main drama is no longer around the protagonist, but with a tentative approach, the scattered clues are intertwined, each clue symbolizes a small theme (the male No. 1 has not yet appeared yet...) . The title of the butterfly in the storm itself indicates that the history is quite uncontrollable. Er, to be honest, the structure that I am going to adopt is a bit of a copy of "The Song of Ice and Fire". The main clues are events, and then the characters are angled, but the structure has no copyright, hehe. (Become "multi-lead invincible"? Sweating...)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of large-scale battle is full of discussion. As far as I personally look at the look and feel of other works, I feel that it is a bit fake to create an inexplicable new small person, or to describe the momentum of war through imaginary description. The former will disrupt the rhythm of the narrative, while the latter will be more likely to look similar. So I finally chose the method of cutting in and adding realistic tactical data. Do not know which works the landlord agrees with? I also refer to learn about ^_^ and finally answer the last question. "Spiritual determination of power" is indeed the basic principle. All settings are made on this basis; therefore, the more a magical formula is used, the more it becomes deeper into the minds of ordinary people, and it becomes easier to use; therefore it is not Everyone can create a new stereotype. In this world, if all the intelligent creatures between the **** think that "magic is not there," then it will become a world without magic... that is, projecting "subjective idealism" directly The product of the material world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comments of the seven-footed teeth at 2005-02-1522:28:09 <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my opinion, "the momentum of war" is a relative concept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, compared to the war itself, the power of the individual is negligible. In the capacity of a participant, a small mistake is enough to extinguish the top - this near-absolute power ratio is the biggest factor that constitutes the truth of war. If we describe war from the perspective of a military strategist, we may see what art of war is (WARCRAFT...explosive, WOW has played more recently); however, if viewed from the perspective of war participants, it will inevitably involve stray bullets and splashes. The soil, the intestines flowing in the ground, shivering and urinating **** crying and wanting to go home but still being supervised by the supervised team to send the soldiers to death, such as all kinds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Superman on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a novel that really gives the impression that "this is war!", the above sentence is almost always true. The war is creating tension and fear because of its cruelty and absoluteness. Maybe you are the savior in the prophecy, but on the battlefield, it makes no sense - you can be blown off by the mines at any time, shattered by the shrapnel, and even pressed into a slab of meat by the armored car. As long as you have gone so badly, you will die on the side of the road and fall to the end of the wild dog you saw yesterday. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, in terms of the novel's approach, rendering the overall momentum of both sides may be quite a clever means, such as "storm-like cavalry" "black cloud Pressing the city to urge" and the like. However, this method usually only works when viewed by a third party. I personally call it "the war of bystanders." Listing the numbers is another way: what is described in this way is the "war of military staff." If you want to describe a "war of soldiers," the use of these two war descriptions is probably not enough. The most practical solution has been used in countless novels - I mainly refer to non-fantasy books. What the "war of the soldiers" needs is --- details! detail! detail! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diffuse smoke is stinging your eyes, the landslide-like explosions hit your ears, and your comrades fall down. The bitch is raised! That group of rabbit scorpions are charging! Aiming - shooting! Upper bayonet - all assault! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the war in fantasy does not need to be described in real terms...but before we can put on a duel, we must at least forget that there is A group of people are watching the poor guy. A Western European knight who made a duel pose is likely to be dragged from the horse's back to the next moment. NPCs may be weaker than NAMED, but at least they can't become the nameless firewood in the contemporary martial arts drama "being touched by a backspace" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
