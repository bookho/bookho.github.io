			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scattered gunshots and wrestling sounds continued inside and outside the city walls, and many soldiers dropped their weapons and raised their hands. The cavalry units left behind to clean the battlefield chased the defenders’ defeated soldiers and confiscated their weapons. One team and one team were taken to the distance. The bodies of the soldiers of both sides piled up from the battlefields of both sides to the wide suspension bridge. The weapons, armor and military uniforms of the deceased were layered together to form a cruel roadblock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guerrilla cavalry’s running horse forcibly swept a road from the corpse, with weapons and limbs falling into the moat, making this artificially-cutting dam Like the boundary river to hell. For the young commander of the Assault Company, this Hell River is the only chance for him to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Robert’s cavalry broke through the shield wall, he lost contact with his subordinates and superiors. In order to avoid those horseshoes, he discarded almost all the equipment and jumped into the river. His magical rumor is not high enough to use the magic of breathing in the water, he can only try to float in the blood, the white military uniform has been covered with blood and stains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been able to hear the shouts from the banks of the moat, and the increasingly dense cover of gunfire, the other artillery position is bombarding the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not coming to die. I will live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If now die If you are here, no one will know his whereabouts. Like countless corpses here, it was buried in the grass and finally turned into a number on the statistics of the Logistics Department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two ways to describe war in words. In the first work, the deceased is just a group of figures, passing between the lines of the word, replaced by the strategy of the commanders and the honor of the generals. The second type of work is focused on rendering the death of the main character, using this method to reflect the cruel killings on the battlefield and the tragic people. The real war is a mixture of the two: the winner enjoys honor and the loser tastes miserable. The living are struggling to survive, and the deceased are not awake. In other words, multiplying the description of the second work by the number of the first work is the result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the body of an unfortunate soldier as a shield, the door was carefully swept to the waterway leading to the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a few minutes ago, the owner of the body was still standing near him; just a few hours ago, he was still happily celebrating the gods with everyone. Festival, eating the firebird baked out in a mess. Thinking of this, the teenager accidentally swallowed a blood and coughed up. He is not strong enough to survive on the bones of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are people still alive? If there are still people alive, come over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe Hearing his cough, someone shouted in the distance. The door was thrown away by the sheltered body and swam over. Several comrades who also used the waterway to escape were gathered in front of an iron watergate. One of them was still familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lieutenant Soledon, directly under the staff?" The officer with the rank of Lieutenant on the shoulder tried to ask. The door nodded and the tight expression on the man's face was slightly relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you unlock magic or impact magic? I learned to dispel and fire magic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is sucking in a cold breath. Unlocking? Impact magic? These spells are too difficult for him to learn only the first stage of magic. He hesitated, staring at the rusty old iron lock on the water gate, recalling the magic he would have. Squat surgery? Primary treatment? Glare? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door suddenly thought of a magic, a move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me give it a try." Soledon lined up everyone, swam to the watergate, whispering the curse, "...ice dagger (ice "刺刺)."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A chill came out of his palm and instantly frozen the surrounding water. The river of Christmas Eve is icy and bitter, and there is no temperature in the right hand using magic. As a result, this ice thorn is also grotesque. He smashed the small ice thorns around him and made an ice rib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I think this thing is probably cutting this lock." The flame master’s tone gradually changed from anticipation to suspicion. "You can do it." ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the experience of wandering on Lennie Street, Lieutenant Soleton carefully pierced the ice thorn into the keyhole of the rust lock and listened to the tremor of the old lock cylinder. A moment, two times, three times...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "咔", the ice is broken. A lament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Budget. There is no way out..." The young man snorted, spit out the cold blood and changed his tone, and began to prepare for magic again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...ice dagger!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second ice thorn is silently extended from his palm come out. When the door is not finished with magic, the ice thorn is directly extended into the keyhole, and the strength of the mind is extended with the slight vibration of the lock cylinder--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Open it. Please, open it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes and experienced the subtle extension of the ice thorn, forcing the result of the magic to be completed. Forms a bridge from one spell to another like a spell...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咔嗒". This soft voice is as sweet as the hymns sung by the angels. The teenager is pleased to find that his technique has not regressed. He and several other people pushed the water gate away and swam into the fortress from the waterway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he didn’t know was that he had already taken the first step of “Super Magic Technology” when this “咔嗒” sounded. It is the door to a few hundred standard magics that expand into near-infinite practical magic. In another history, the man known as "the most comprehensive master of history", first encountered the starting point of this technology here -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Meta sculpt, a super-magic technique that changes the shape of a spell's active area. That is a completely different starting point from the “energy” of Jenica. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, outside the city of Fortified, the offensive and defensive has been translocated. Eugen led his army to once again attack the French artillery positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All field artillery advancement, don't let the other party cross our line of defense!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Europe In front of the tide-like offensive, the remaining French monks are still advancing. Even if Robert took more than half of the manpower, even if the enemy in front of him was almost twice as much, the soldiers of the elite army "French" from the Free Army were still confident. Regardless of whether the opposing commanders are from the central elite, they also have confidence that they will not easily lose to the rabble who are put together by the coup and the fortress garrison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Awful! We have 4,000 people, they have less than 2,000 people! To be able to break even this level of defense, what do I see? Lord Marshal! Attack again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eugen roared at his majesty. When the battle was about to fall into a stalemate again, the reinforcements sent by Gowar finally arrived. It was a strange soldier outside the expectations of the French. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Fause fleet can hit, we can also hit. Hit it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Cousin’s fleet savagely entered the already established landing site in the same way as the Fauses fleet. The eight company soldiers from the southern fortresses raised the flag of the green background and followed the same path, cutting off the connection between the fourth guard and the artillery positions from behind. The ratio of the strength of the two sides has changed from two to one to three to one, and even more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lieutenant looked at the scene and opened his mouth in surprise, and even the cigar that was lying on the ground was unaware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The original Marshal is thinking this way. Directly borrowing the other party's prepared strategy, great. This time I personally led the team, attack, we have to join the friendly army In their artillery position!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the attack ended before it started - because the opponent ignited white on all positions The flag is lowered. Eugen and Cousin did indeed work in the artillery position, but the faces of the two had no expression of the winner; and the other major who came to hand over the surrender did not perform like a floppy loser. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Chief Principal of Robert confessed to us, if you attack us from the flank or behind us, we can surrender immediately. We don't have to be in a winning war. We paid too many unnecessary casualties, so we decided to surrender. Anyway, when the lieutenant colonel catches your marshal, we will immediately resume freedom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...If you are an emperor, I have already killed you on the spot before the position. If I say, you may not be able to catch Govar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "That is impossible, because Robert A. Lieutenant Colonel Ayre represents justice. Although justice may not always win, he will certainly win."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major is still not a humble answer. Obviously, all other staff and soldiers around him agree with him. Seeing this group of officers and men who trust the chief officer to exaggerated, Eugen has nothing to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I always thought that the rumors were exaggerated, but I didn't expect it to be true. The French army was really a sect, and Betsy was their god. Robert is his prophet, and they still have a textbook as a holy book. Unfortunately, it is estimated that it will not be me to ban this church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry." Major Cousin intervened. "The marshal's battle plan is perfect. As long as Robert wants to keep the cavalry, he will only die. I don't see any mistakes in the plan..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem is that no one can count as an accident." Eugen interrupted without mercy. "I believe the Marshal's experience and experience, but his plan is It is based on the fact that the other party has only one army. If the other party still has reinforcements, or... I think we are still ready to reinforce."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No, Marshal Govar has specially confessed that I don’t want to reinforce. If the situation is not good, he will choose the waterway to come and meet. If we . Go in, and even the possibility of withdrawal are not a "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; hear the words of Peter, Eugen look suddenly thickened. "Do you really say this to the Marshal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Receive all quickly The Fortress, the guns in the direction of the city wall. The company will take time to rest, and then there may be hard work." Eugen reached out and smashed his jacket pocket, grabbed the last cigar, "I hate all tricks. They I don't know if the strategy is risky? Damn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nearest exit of the waterway is at the foot of the giant wall of the fortress, between the cracks of the building. They walked out to the place close to the main road and saw an exceptionally bleak picture. The confetti banner hanged to celebrate the Promenade was picked up by the sabre, fell to the ground and stepped on the horseshoe, and soon became a dark piece. The cold wind passes through the lanes of Fort Fort, blowing on the people who are struggling out of the water, turning their skin into cyan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, Naimen had time to calculate the number of people who had escaped on the same road as themselves. A total of seven people, three assault companies, two infantry companies, and two military monks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe, there are so many people left in more than a thousand people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hits A cold greeting, hurriedly expelled this unlucky idea from his mind. Before dropping the moat, he saw Major Constance commanding the surviving troops to retreat into the fortress, and they would have been safe. If he is alone, he can surrender, but now...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no flame magic that makes us easy, so it will freeze!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I have only learned some attacking magic... Lieutenant Soledon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Ah?" Hearing the conversations of his comrades, Nana came back from his thoughts. "Sorry, I have not prepared this magic... Auntie!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of his sneeze, the hooves and the conversation with the French accent came from the other end of the building. The faces of the soldiers changed, and they looked at the two chiefs with panic. Nanimen and the lieutenant looked at each other and immediately made a decision: "There is a bunker over there, hide it first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just hid in hiding Behind the bunker of a cannonball, an entire cavalry squad rushed to where they were, and happened to stop at the artillery firing line. The door knocked out the Flint from the pocket and wanted to ignite the fire; but the Flint was damp and could not be touched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give it to me." The lieutenant ignited a spark on his fingertips and ignited the fuse. The dull explosion of the guns rang, and hundreds of lead particles went out -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the moment of the light curtain, Naimen lost a sentence "Fast escape!" and turned and ran into the fortress group. At this moment, Lieutenant, who often travels to the corners of the fortress to inspect the materials, has finally played the advantage of his experience. Among all the people who came from Lenny to this fortress, he may be the most familiar with the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to go back alive...forgive me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his back and in front, Dreary fires, harsh explosions, and the brilliance of magical instruments are on the rise. He fled at a speed that he could not believe, and fled in the direction of survival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are swimming out of the moat? First retreat to the back to change clothes, warm up!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A captain in a blue military uniform stopped him. Resist the door and looked up and saw a familiar face - it was the captain who rescued him from Lenny. The door is vaguely remembered that he used to be a magic officer who used only magic instead of firearms, but now he is also like a normal soldier with a slick gun behind the bunker. The "direct staff of the staff headquarters" with the pride of the number has also been exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind them, is the central square where everyone celebrated the coming of the Shennar Festival, the only space in the entire fortress that allows the cavalry to be reorganized for a dinner party. The fire is still not extinguished. The door was run to the side of the fire, greedily absorbing the heat, so that the already stiff limbs would not be necrotic. The clothes soaked in the moat and blood are frozen by the cold wind, and they stick to the skin. If you want to take off, you may be confused. He took off his coat and placed it on the side of the fire, and put the soaked bomb bag, gunpowder bag and his black handle with a handle on the military coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If Shenneng can make a wish, I only want a safe and warm place to sleep. It is also unavoidable to die in such an empty square. It’s too cold, it’s a little better than being dead in the moat...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reacted fiercely. open? Here is the only place where the entire fortress can gather the army! This is unreasonable... He looked up and saw a strange sack around him, and he understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone, hurry, leave here! Here is where the marshals arranged for the enemy to bury, we can't stay! Once the last line of defense is broken, here is It turned into a sea of ​​fire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door shouted loudly, grabbed the wet and cold coat, and put it on again, and the icy cold was immediately spread throughout the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Very smart, Lieutenant Soleilton. Since you have noticed the superior arrangement, I don't have to make another order. Lieutenant Soledon! Martin Lieutenant! Return to the team immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown when, Constance also stood by the fire. Although there is no magic, the military uniform of the gendarmerie captain who also escaped from the crash disaster seems to be much cleaner than the two magicians, and it is not so embarrassing. Seeing that he also survived, Nana felt a peace of mind and felt that things might not have been as bad as he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow, sir! I can ask, how many people have we escaped?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Cyan frowned and lowered his voice: "About three hundred people, but in the previous lags, many people were sacrificed. There are still more than two hundred people left. You are the only one who survived." Long..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous shelling interrupted his words. People subconsciously looked in the direction of the sound, only to see the fragments of the tower shield and the broken pistol flying in the air with the fire. The nightmare chaser finally broke through the last obstacle to the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gowar observed the action of the Fabian cavalry with a telescope on the shore cannon near the port. The commander of the shiny silver breastplate outside the green uniform came to the middle of the square and looked at the remains of the firebird competition. The guerrilla cavalry rushed into the square, and the striker shot the defender who withdrew from the square with a pistol, trying to knock them back, and the rest of the team was near the fire in the middle of the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the veteran Marshal who has experienced a lot of battles, I feel a little excitement at the moment. Every real general will be excited and excited when he meets a chance to win more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Full gun door preparation. The enemy has arrived at the square, waiting for them to attack the whole team at the beginning!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"It's Robert &#183; Ayr. His sword seems to be really like a rumor..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rasta stares tightly The figure of the commander, and the unremarkable iron bars in his waist, swept away the burning cravings in his eyes, and then converge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Detonated!" When almost all the Fabians arrived in the square, the marshal decisively reached the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis aimed at a gunpowder barrel at the corner of the square and accurately shot a flame ray. Several other magic officers hiding in the vicinity also started to detonate all the gunpowder behind the Fagas and split their troops. More than twenty fortresses began to pour fire at the places where these guerrilla cavalry were located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explosion immediately caused confusion in Robert’s army. The frightened horse was galloping, and the mage who was responsible for using the anti-fear enchantment was exhausted. A small number of teams completed the entire team, but they were unable to break through the blockage of the front. Gowar has mobilized all the forces at hand, and every 20-row infantry array is arranged on every road leading to the port, enough to stop almost any assault that lacks fire support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Muse is about to be wiped out by the whole army...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a yellow magical light Direct flight to Robert &#183; Ay, hit him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing this scene, Rasta took a sigh of relief, and he feared that the sword would be destroyed by this brutal attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the result of this gun was beyond the expectations of the Viscounts and all the officers on the fort. Robert did not fall from the moment and was not injured. He just pulled out the sword and pointed the tip of the sword at the direction in which the yellow light flew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The road is already open! Go forward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the cavalry are down, With fierce gunfire, he rushed to the attacking Constance and his more than two hundred soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing dares to believe what happened next. In front of Robert, who is on the verge of desperation, there is really a miraculous road! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All put down the weapon and let the center of the road. This is the order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Constance With his daunting eyes and the handguns clenched in his hands, he swept all the eunuchs one by one. Everyone opened their mouths and was surprised by this order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say, sir?! So the enemy will break through from us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just want them to break through from us. This coup is enough. It should be over. There should be no more blood. Now retreat immediately, otherwise don't blame me for not talking about friendship."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sain’s face is a rare smile that looks chilling. Even a dull person now understands his identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the traitor of Bezi ambush here?!" The question of resistance to the door blurted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The word "small" is a bit ugly... right, Lieutenant Solitaire of the Southwest Army? The steaks of the officer's restaurant are good."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this sentence, Nana finally understood and opened his mouth. The cold wind passed uncontrollably through the nose of the young officer and rushed into his lungs. He coughed up and couldn't take it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to everything is solved. I want to put that kind of wax pill in the steak, and there is no difficulty for the head of the anti-espionage department. The reason why he did not immediately die, but because the gendarmerie captain is also a spy... probably because of the "enemy enemy is a friend" reason? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared at the two guns tied together, imagining the sight of a one-fifth-pound shot put on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Blood flower will splash a beautiful parabola in the air. I am just an ordinary person, an ordinary tool, a tool that is manipulated by others in the palm of my hand. There is no choice to survive.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
