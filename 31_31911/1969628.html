			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The San Francisco Clippers "Wittsland" squatted in the morning, quietly leaning on Port Lennie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crew slowly picked up the sails and parked the boat on the easternmost dock. The commander first disembarked and rushed to inform the nearby guards; the sailors quickly rushed out of the cabin and used the detection magic to lay down the warning line along the ship's side to prevent possible raids. This ship carries people who are vital to the national movement of the Republic of the Union and cannot tolerate any accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, we are here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young lieutenant colonel after the ship has stopped Take a deep breath and knock on the hatch of the special class to evoke the special passengers under house arrest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radez Govar sat up and habitually put the quilt in order and put on the uniform. The former marshal who once reconciled the entire Freedom Army stood at the front of the mirror and looked at the appearance. He picked up the golden star on his shoulder and handed it to Lieutenant Colonel Hull Tedwood waiting at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," Herreb admire. If he is replaced by himself, he will never be able to retain such a temper after being captured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are all bloodshot in your eyes. Didn't sleep last night, Lieutenant Colonel Tedwood?" Govar's tone is not like a prisoner of war, but like 谆谆Caring for the subordinate's superiors, "How can I continue to fight without raising my spirit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her's smile: "No, I am just seasick and I can't sleep." The people who really stay up all night are on the deck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Radz yawned, did not continue to ask, indicating that the lieutenant colonel led the way. Soon, they saw the one who had not slept all night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supreme power of the ship, Lieutenant General Clad Lopez, leaned over the military cap and leaned against the guardrail of the ship's side. The general's expression was as tired and vicissitudes as usual, and there was almost no trace of overnight stays. In other words, this middle-aged man was a night when he was overnight. When he saw Hull and Radz, he looked up and said, "Good morning, sir. Welcome back to Lenny."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radez looks around It was found that there was a company of guards around them, and another cavalry squad had blocked the port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have to be so enemies at all, I am not good at magic. What about the old man?" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Leave first. If you are not there, this trial is necessary to be present."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The rebel leader smiled ironically. "Can you go with me, Clade?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you wish." Clad stepped forward and helped him over ten years older than him. The former marshal went down the ramp. The carriage with the black curtain was already ready, and Clade stepped forward to open the door for Radzla. Gowar also sat in humility. The cavalry around them sipped and cleaned the road. Under the command of Hull, the carriage was covered, and the infantry company trotting down the place not far behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an uninformed person sees this scene, he will probably think that this is the two generals of the same camp, and certainly will not guess that they are on the battlefield. The good rivals will not even guess that they are the relationship between the winner and the captive. But if a politician who knows everything sees this scene, he will be surprised to open his mouth: he will guess that the two men have reached a certain deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Anne Reese Seifer, who is wearing a red military uniform and watching it all on the deck, this is more than just a guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was no credit for the credit, and the support of the Northern Army was obtained through out-of-court transactions, and the venue prepared by Wiener Betsy was promoted. My own merits, bright and unbeatable. I just gave him an intelligence, he can do so beautiful, it is worthy of the 're-employment of the gods' Lopez... It seems that the Marshal badge should be no problem."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue-eyed blue eyes of a girl became a line, and struggled to go to the trial site. If her sister Bonnie handles this matter, she will definitely stare at the end, even if the incident itself is boring; but this does not meet her preferences. The trial is only a form, and all results should be decided before the trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them took a thin metal rod and hid it in a pocket and asked a little curiously: "Why don't you go there yourself? This is better for Bonnie and Bartholomew..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Nonsense. I don't have citizenship, or a woman, how can I get permission to listen? Also use some brains. Don't hurry to chase the carriage?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand." Seeing Anne waving a pink fist with a little anger, the two hurriedly ran off the boat. Seeing their figure disappeared into the car rental at the dockside, the girl sighed with blond hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is one or both of them so unreliable? Everyone is awed by Bonnie and afraid of Bardot, but how come I have hippie smiles here. I can't figure it out..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has two public identities: one is the direct maid of the "funded gold" hostess of the big consortium and the two general managers. One, the other is the reserve lieutenant of the Freedom Army Intercontinent. The red military uniform she wore was the symbol of the latter, and the intelligence officers and guards around him were all "pure gold." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, her true identity is much more complicated than this: she is a future person. The future man from the era of highly developed magic in two hundred and fifty years is also the only great magician of this era. A great magician named Reese Quillahia who can use nine pieces of magic. Because of her and her sister's existence, fate has undergone subtle changes: it is a new world created from the dusty history books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking, it seems that there is still an agreement..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember the "that guy", Annie shook her head. "The guy" was so lazy that she didn't even come to the whole collection, which made her wait here for the morning. He was full of lies, greedy for money, stealing fraud, and he was not aware of his poor strength. Last night, he even put his hand on her, and almost stole her important belongings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The guy is actually the sweetheart of 黛妮卡. It is obvious that the adoptive parents are very honest, kind, and hopeless, how can he become that Looks like? Is it a reverse period?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the final analysis, the agreement is an agreement. She said that if he wants to explain to him and his family, he will do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guy" was lying on the bed in the health cabin, staring at the wood grain on the ceiling, and was unaware of the fact that the ship had already been ported. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past month is like a dream. Become a lieutenant logistics officer, mix into the enemy like a spy, and madly join the comrades in the war, avoid the death in the slit of the war, sniff the blood and swim in the ice water... This is all over. Those who have followed him, those who have been hostile to him, those who have supported him silently... None of them are now by his side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, he is finally going home. The past month was just a small embarrassment in his life, just an anecdote that could be left in memory in the future. From today on, the daily peaceful life will return to him. Those wars, and those who died in the war, will have nothing to do with him. If you are snoring, let the person who is willing to do it. He only needs to pay taxes. Magic can be studied in amateur research, used to change the trick, create fire, and catch mice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t have enough talent, he can’t make a living by magic, and he doesn’t have the money to buy expensive materials, scrolls, and theoretical books. He can only use it as a hobby. Although he only has the first stage of magic, it is enough for him to leave the welfare home and find a good apprenticeship in the Grand Council. With enough work experience and savings, he can donate a citizenship, and a young girl who is not beautiful but can work, is called "Mr." or even "Mr. Dear"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Soledon?" Someone shouted his name, but he didn't notice it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is too much money in the world, but there is too little money for a person who has no life and no talent. Which guild is going to go? Pottery, tanning, smelting, machinery, construction? Or try to go to the Freedom Wizards Guild? If you ask Mr. Folan to introduce it, it may be feasible. If you go there, you don't have to use magic as a hobby. You can get permission to enter the guild library after a few years of service, and you can get free citizenship. That thousand pounds is a lot of money. Without citizenship, there is no status in this country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorlayton!" A hand with dark green nail polish swayed in front of his eyes. He just turned around and stared at another piece of wood grain, revealing the back of the head to the strange disturber who did not know where to come from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thought is the source. Knowledge is skill. Faith is power. Magic is for the guardian of the thinker. I fight for this and I call myself a magician. First for the thinker, then for the magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he really has potential magical talent? After all, in this world, where you can rely on your own efforts, without relying on your life and money to get a chance to exercise magic, there is another place... He shook his head sharply and expelled the idea from his mind. He lives in a real world. In this world, money and status are everything. A gamble is not something he should do. He should choose a safe path...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abominable! Did you hear it!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the voice is angry. She did not hesitate to use her full weight, pressed on the side of the "that guy" -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next scream is so Far, even the commander of the fleet that was about to disembark, Leonard Kikawi, heard it. The semi-elf's sensitive hearing captured the screams here, but thought it was an illusion and did not pay much attention. Other seafarers have already disembarked to enjoy the rare holiday after the crisis, and will not visit it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah...you...you..." Solerton's five senses twisted into a ball and his body twitched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie stood up and happily slammed her hands: "Go. It’s time to go to your house, I will explain for your recent whereabouts... eh? How? I think my weight is probably not enough to crush you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really don't care, but just... my left leg was crushed It’s time to come.” The teenager sat up and suppressed the pain. The blonde girl turned red and turned her head. Her hand groped in the inner pocket of the military uniform: "Sorry, use this to stop the pain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton Through the blue-light syrup, the transparency and dazzling dark blue are enough to show its concentration and grade. "I can use this... no problem? It looks expensive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't want your family to see the bandage on your wound? Drink Let's take off the bandage and I will wait for you outside the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager stared at the bottle of blue-blue therapeutic potion. I don't know why, he remembered the blue world. Last night he tried to steal a little thing from the girl in front of him, stealing the projection of the whole world. It was a dreamlike memory - even now, he doesn't believe that the girl in front of him really has something so magical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hesitating for a while, he drank and all the tingling sensation almost disappeared at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...thank you." Soledon tried to thank him, but was interrupted by Anne impatiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not talk nonsense, go on the military uniform and go. We can give a confession on the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The confession?" Resist the door and thought back. "Ah, are you telling the stories to be used to swindle the nuns? Well, we should be right, to match the letter of the family." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speak while walking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two hired a carriage at the dock. As it is expected that the road connecting the Eastern District Supreme Court will be traffic jams, they circled the road and crossed the half-city to the welfare homes also located in the Eastern District. They also reviewed the fictional story that was about to be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was a good thing happening today. Maybe there will be a letter from Seneca or Soledon?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking advantage of the leisure time after breakfast, Sister Wei Lun predicted the gas movement today with prophecy. The St. Grace's Welfare Home has been in good shape recently, and there are many more children to raise; there is nothing to worry about except for the two wanderers who are away from home. Of course, she didn't even figure out that Solton, who is the equivalent of her adopted son, is making up a confession: the accuracy of prophecy is generally only 65%, which is a little higher than a nonsense or a coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it. Now they should be immersed in a happy trip, I am afraid I have no time to send a letter to my family. When the child grows up, he will go out." Going on the adventure, this can't be stopped." Zalt Fran, who cuts the costumes on the side, smiled and repudiated. "After all, the last letter was just a week ago. Yes, I made a dress for you. Do you want to try it, Wei Lun?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, this is the Women's Department of the Royal Theological Seminary... Besides, are you not too happy to wear it? Or will I be your alma mater next time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Introspection of theological seminary? It is quite nostalgic to say..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are discussing the issue of women’s uniforms, from the wall The approaching hooves soon became a knock on the door again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister Weilun! Have a letter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nuns sorted out the grooming and ran all the way Go out. Zalt followed him, and he couldn’t see the look of refutation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From postage from Kengler, postage has been paid, please sign for it." The female postman in green uniform took the letter from the letter bag behind the black post. Sign the receipt. Seeing the woman’s school uniform worn by the nun, the postman’s face was full of surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nun was a little embarrassed to thank and quickly pressed the seal, and then robbed the letter. The word on the envelope is the round body of Juan Xiu. At first glance, it is the word of 黛妮卡. The young female postman seemed to be a little embarrassed, and rushed to the carriage without saying a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You see, there is a good thing." As soon as I got back to the house, the nun couldn’t wait to open it. "Let me see... she changed her name." I used my nickname to do a surname, and it seems that I have to sever my relationship with her father. It’s really young.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Seneca Weilun? And you The name is very similar, it sounds good.” Zalt smiled happily. “Although I haven’t seen Clade for a long time, I don’t want to tell him about this.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nun snorted: "Let's come to this compliment. She wants to follow the new companion to the north?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zalte's face is condensed:" North? Isn't she already in Ruslock? Is it the 'North'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You guessed it. She is going to the empire. She said she If you want to see the whole world, you may not be able to write a letter for a long time, let us not worry." Wei Lun smiled bitterly. "That is an empire that is difficult to send to the letter. How can you not worry?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Coman Empire. If something goes wrong, it will be troublesome...the weather is not good." Zalt thoughtfully. The climate he said clearly does not mean the weather. He remembered the day when he became known as "National Fran" to avoid tracking. "What the hell did she think? Right, is Solerton going together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister Weilun continues to look down: "No, Jenny The card said in the letter that he did not want to go to the empire. He liked a beautiful girl, I am afraid that he planned to settle down and not come back. He did not bring the girl back to show us? The young man is really happy..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zalt’s face suddenly dignified: “Wei Lun, give me a letter. I feel a little bit wrong.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?" The nun passed the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think there is a three-point lie in this letter, especially the part of Soledon. If he is really in love, how can he not write something?" How could you not tell us the name of the girl? I think it might be an accident..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the nun immediately became angry:" Today is the Shennar Festival. Don’t you say this kind of thing?!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sorry, but this letter is really a bit strange. Look, the letter. I didn't write the name of the recipient, but I didn't get it back. We didn't know the postman just now, but they called your name... Don't you think there is a subtle sense of disharmony? Maybe our children They got involved in the troublesome incident."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zalt.Fran frowned and seemed to want to see something from this letter. . At this time, the sound of the hooves approached outside the courtyard wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here are two golden pounds, don't look for it." Annie threw the money to the driver. "Go, Soledon. You stare at the post." What did the carriage leave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, nothing, just think that the car is retrograde..." Soledon jumped out of the car and hesitated to ask: “Can you knock on the door first? I am a little embarrassed.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
