The staff members borrowed from the room left by the Sixth Division when they retreated, dealing with the aftermath of daytime fighting. Re-opening the Königs City Government, restoring security in the city, arranging prisoners of war, and accepting military institutions... There are so many things to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire staff is enveloped in a low pressure, and people do not have any emotions after the victory. In the previous battle, the Intercontinent had nearly two hundred casualties, only to retrieve more than three hundred captives and thirty-one artillery pieces from the Medibies. The staff members were confident that they would take the opportunity to defeat the empire and the people of the Ruhrlocks, recover Kengler and push into the northwest, but did not expect to get the result of this difficult victory or failure. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when more than a dozen surviving Sixth Division and National Fifth Division officers entered the staff, everyone still played the spirit. Chief Staff Hull; Lieutenant Tedwood smashed the dark circles caused by staying up late, stood up and welcomed the greatest credit, and also ate the greatest suffering. These people have been sleeping all day, and now they are much better than the people in the staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Working hard, Eugen's senior." Hull greeted him and kissed intimately. "But, aren't you quit smoking?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like most of the staff officers, they graduated from the Army College of Lenny, commonly known as the "Military Academy." The two have a lot of differences, and they have not met before. Tedwood graduated with a third place in outstanding performance, and was the fastest among the graduates of the calendar year; the 28-year-old Eugen flew at a low-end score in the penultimate, and suffered in the expeditionary force of the New World. After six years of work, he was promoted to the staff headquarters with outstanding achievements. When he arrived at the staff headquarters, he was also unhappy. The news about him was an anecdote like "the officer who found chewable gum." It was not until this coup that his name was spread in the Free Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The hard work is better, only the gums accumulated in the past few days chewed, so I had to take two more. You have to come one day later, I am afraid that even the tobacco Not enough." Eugen put away the smile of the usual day, and smothered the cigarette that was being smoked on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her noticed that the paper on his cigarette faintly revealed the words of the "command book" and thought of the hard battles that this person had passed before. Can not help but take a breath of cold, changed the subject. "The sergeant has been waiting for you for a long time. Should you know him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." Eugen was silent for a moment, suddenly standing upright, facing the commander-in-chief of the Free Army. Officer, Conti; Marshal Fox has a standard military ceremony. "Ega; Major Eugen, affiliated with the Strategic Planning Division of the Staff Headquarters, returned today, please order!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tore off his shoulder The general badge is placed on the table. The rank he reported was not the lieutenant colonel he received at Fort Vatican, nor the major general when he was in charge of Matt Bissi, but the major at the time of the general staff of the Strategic Planning Office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This move not only stunned all the staff, but even the officers who came with him were shocked. For a time, no one knows how to deal with this scene. Finally, Hull reacted and shouted loudly to all the staff: "All stand up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All but the Marshals of Fox "squat" neatly Stand up. Everyone knows that Ega; Eugen is the real hero. If it wasn't for him to create an opportunity to intercept the emperor, it would be useless for the Intrecle to move fast and plan to be more careful - things could have been worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To the hero of Kengal, salute!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone’s right hand is neatly raised Start. Last night, most of these staff members stayed up all night in order to go beyond the conventional marching plan, but their tired faces were still filled with tribute from the bottom of their hearts. It is easy to say that it is easy to give up, but there are very few soldiers who can really tear off their own ranks. They were also unable to raise their hands, and the entire staff was immersed in a rare silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last one who stood up was Fox, who wore a white Marshal military gown. The 70-year-old man personally picked up the epaulettes on the table and handed it to Eugen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello..." Eugen hesitated and seemed to want to quit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? Do you want me to give you another award ceremony? Or do you want to take away the nickname of my 'Kingle's Fox'? "The old Marshal's eyes are filled with smiles. "This nickname is for you, I am afraid it is more suitable than giving me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little embarrassed Eugen grabbed the back of the head . "No, no, I don't have this luxury at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Major General Eugen, from now on you are the commander of the new Sixth Division This division will be composed of the strength of the Fifth National Division and the former Sixth Division. The insufficient part will be supplemented by the second division.” Fox said his decision. “The empire may tear the face and launch a full-scale war at any time. The army must move forward, and your department may be responsible for the flank defense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Below the age of 30, you can become a major general, you should be the first Congratulations, you have refreshed the promotion record of the Military Academy, Eugen’s senior.” Hearing the words of Hull, people laughed and diluted the previously suppressed atmosphere. Of course, they don’t know if they feel embarrassed about Eugen. After all, most of Eugen and the same high-level students are serving as general chiefs officers in various divisions or departments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment of celebration, a commander rushed into the staff and grabbed a white cover with a red title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lieutenant Colonel, there is an emergency magic newsletter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her; Lieutenant Colonel Tedwood When I saw the cover, my face turned white immediately. The “emergency” sign on the cover hits the highest, while the “encrypted” one is empty. This proves that this message uses more than 30 communication magicians and ensures that every free command of the Free Army can immediately understand the news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not ask what is documented: every means of communication invented by humans is to deliver bad news faster, not good news. The worst bad news is that it does not need to be kept secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hull tore the report and read it quickly. After reading it, he repeated the current situation mentioned in the report to everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This morning, the Holy Coman Empire submitted a declaration of war to us. Their troops began to move three days ago, and the Pioneer has crossed the Oslo River. A group of invading troops are presumed to have three to five troops, about ten to fifteen thousand people, and will invade our country in three ways within fifteen days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eruption in the crowd There was a whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ambras in the middle of the Oslo River have been struggling with the enemy road cluster, and the twelfth 'Oss River' division has been tripled. According to the current situation, the Twelfth Division with a full membership rate of only 60% can only support one to two weeks at most."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a violent explosion in the crowd Whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Steel Lieutenant General of the first division of Steelburg was passively fighting, letting the emperor build a supply station along the King's Road Without any harassment, the loyalty is very suspicious. The enemy west road cluster avoids Steelburg, and the 40,000 main force is rolling south along the king's river, leaving only less than 10,000 people to monitor the fortress. The movement is unclear, and it is presumed that it will attack the Fabians hinterland along the direction of Champagne and Brandi."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a deafening whisper in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hereby request that the Central Army Marshal Fox, the Western Army General Lopez, act in accordance with the No. 6 counterattack plan, and the Eastern Army will act in accordance with the No. 5 defensive plan. Military Staff Meeting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her closed the document and took a deep breath and turned to Major General Eugen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are coming faster than we think. Major General, originally scheduled for your division to defend the flank, it may not seem right now. The entire Central Army and the Western Army It’s the first priority to turn to counterattacks. You should also know that one-third of the Central Army’s strength is near Rennie, and one-third is in the area between Kengal and Lennie. They have to go to Kengal for about fifteen days. In the same half a month, as long as there is no interference from Steelburg, the emperor can rely on the waterway to supply, and advance to Gistov and Kengler at full speed. Only the sixth division and our second division can come in handy in this half-month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hull nodded. "We desperately stopped the enemy west road cluster and created opportunities for Lopez; and you joined the 12th Division and delayed the enemy central cluster. This is the best plan at the moment."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eugen was silent for a moment, took the report and read it himself, and did not answer for a long time. His hand unknowingly licked the paper sheet of the report, and the paper corner was gently rolled up and gently released. Just getting an official promotion order, I received such a dangerous task, and anyone who feels hesitant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eugen, I know that you are very hesitant. Your new teacher is pieced together and cannot be compared with the tenth or sixth division you commanded before. But now we have no choice.” Fox saw the reason for his hesitation at a glance, and persuaded him. "If the other side passes the northern border, don't say that the first division is undecided, even the twelfth division may surrender. We must let them know that the Republic has not given up on them! This task can only be done by you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new general shrugged and walked to the military map on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the price of the upgrade, I will complete the task. However, I am not going to face the Imperial Central Army." Eugen’s fingers are Crossed the map and stayed in the middle of the northern border of Jules. "We want to take down Fort Steel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This place name appears, the surrounding staff They frowned. Is this new Eugen official who is in full swing and intends to attack the first division of the Freedom Army with the most experience in combat? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can the first division be an enemy or a friend, is it still undecided? General Pickett is a rough, cold-blooded, difficult-to-handle Ruhrlock. I think he is likely to surrender to the empire," Hull reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The guy used to be the commander of the New World Expeditionary Force. I know him very well. He is qualified as a bureaucrat general, but he is actually responsible. The teacher is too indecisive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing that Eugen criticized the former sergeant without hesitation, Hull frowned and took a shot The shoulder of the new general will stop him. "Okay, let's discuss this new plan. If there is a danger of being cut off in the back road, give up Steelburg and use the sport to fight the enemy on the central plateau. There are 35,000 of us behind you. , enough to meet you back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will consider this. So let us review this plan from the beginning. The first stage of the plan is to capture Tilburg..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door has been quietly watching this scene, faintly feeling a little wrong. Why did Eugen’s proposal be accepted so smoothly? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these senior officers of the Free Army, war is a race, a brutal race. In peacetime, the promotion of officers depends on their connections; in times of war, it is based on iron merits and luck that can survive. There are only so many high-level positions, the winners can rise, the losers... they usually have no chance to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the luck is very good, the eunuch has the opportunity to be the lucky one to be promoted by the FireWire and take the senior officer’s road from this point; if the luck is not good, He may become a 21% dead soul--this is the average death rate of low-ranking front-line officers in various battles in history, even higher than the death rate of soldiers. If you participate in the battle repeatedly, then this number will be higher. The probability of death in a war is often as high as 20%, or 30. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He understands a bit: his future is tied to Eugen’s gamble, and there is no choice. Before the end of the war, he could not go to the military academy for further study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least, the victory of the war is impossible to forge. Win is victory, defeat is defeat." Ningmen muttered to himself, did not listen to Eugen Detailed plan. He found that he didn't really hate this hard-hitting challenge - even if it was a bloody war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... The ultimate goal of this new plan is to create an in-depth situation in which the most powerful West Road Group of the three-way enemy forces is going deep, forcing their opponents to retreat. The whole king of the river will be in our hands. The code of the plan is set to 'Morning Dew', I hope this will bring good luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eagan The voice is confident, clear, and powerful, just as he can see the results of the war. Resently infected by the future sergeant, Namimen also joined the staff's discussion of the new plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war is approaching Lenny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s ironic that the harbinger of war has always been the first to appear in less intuitive places. Long before the blood flowed into the river and the bones were everywhere, before the guns rumbling and the banner was exhibited, the harbinger of the war had already appeared before the big man was so impassioned that the little man was horrified and fled. The war is such a big storm that it will affect everything in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the dandelion war, the omen was that the iron pans on the market were quietly disappearing, and it was difficult to buy metal utensils that were worthless in the past. Those pig irons were all cast into weapons. These weapons were used by the successors of the elves to kill each other and eventually defeated the elf empire itself in the first Koman. Before the free state declared its independence, the omen was the sudden rise in the price of salted fish in the imperial capital. All the merchant ships and fishing boats in the southern port set sail, and the sailors and seamen went to the island of Interlaken to kill each other's beliefs. No one had ever fished the seafood of Deran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this war, the first response was Lenny's magic goods trading market. This market has a history of several decades, and today's blue diamond sign is hanging high in front of the market, indicating the heroic assets of its new owner. The traders wore a blue-breasted diamond badge on their chests, holding cards full of numbers, and climbing up and down around the big market kanban. Merchants from all over the Republic gathered in the market and gathered in front of various gemstones, rare metals and weapons armor, but few people traded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? Because on the big market board, the 90% pure gold index, the 98% pure Mithril index, the first-grade amethyst index, and the various cat's eye stone indexes all hang in the back. Inexplicable big buy orders continue to enter, one day to support the market 30%, everyone knows that something big will happen soon, how dare to buy and sell? Market traders are whispering and seem to be waiting in this noisy environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market is open and closed, the agents come out, and the people in the market only see more, not less. Everyone is waiting for it, staring at the big market kanban, for fear of missing the moment of the re-opening, even the carriage with the blue diamond mark quietly stopped at the partial door. The driver carefully opened the door and there was a golden glow in the door. The glamorous young woman with jewels swayed her legs and stepped down the carriage. Dressing seemed to be vulgar but there was an imposing manner to control everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Reza, is the bidding result coming out? Is the military bill approved?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Respectfully questioning is the general agent who controls the transaction. This agent is experienced and has been in this market for more than two decades, but he is also convinced by the means of accumulation of money by the female inventor and industrialist in front of him. He has never seen a businessman who is as capable as the lady and her general manager. The magic items in the hands of these women are as easy to produce and sell as the stones in the quarry outside the city. They directly or indirectly control the shares of textiles, magic goods, metallurgy and even finance, and now they can be used in the city of Lenny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde woman known as "Ms. Reesa" gently nodded: "We got 30% of the orders for equipment, 55% of the armor and military uniform orders, 70% of the orders for magic items. Buy the order, from the spot, three months to one year, all-part-to-all. The war broke out and will not end too soon."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general agent stopped breathing for a while. The figures in front of the woman’s understatement are related to the flow of millions of gold pounds on paper. He has been a trader for so long, and he has never done such a big deal. He called all the secondary traders and took a deep breath and ordered it loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take out your skills and pack all the tight materials on the market! Push the index up, the war broke out!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he was prepared to build all the materials from magic metal to gemstones three months ago. But the ability to issue this trading order still made him feel an indescribable pleasure. The traders received orders and rushed around in the market. The quill pens were written like flying, and the purchase orders fell like snowflakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five gold fifty-five hands!" "Mystery silver thirty-seven hands!" "New World gum one hundred and ten hands!" "Water burning seventy-five "Hands!" "Second-class diamonds and seven hands!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The war broke out!" "The military increase bill was approved!" The rest of the traders were also excited. The speculative blood burns in their bodies. What better than the war to make speculators excited? Treasury bonds and stock markets are bleak because of the war panic. The hundreds of millions of hot money in the city of Lenni have nowhere to go. What else can they do without buying magic items? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forgot to say, we still have a secret order from the military. Put all the precious metals together and wait for the deployment. I have studied the apprentices who activate alchemy to enlist them." She married the general agent. "In addition, I want you to go to the futures trading market to order as much black wood and oak as possible, to the river fleet, as soon as possible. Everything about the trading market, from now on, you are all responsible, I will not ask again. You only need to send a weekly report to the Blue Diamond Finance Department, where they will be responsible for forwarding to my supervisor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your trust. Excuse me, do you have anything important?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza's smile is somewhat elusive. "Ah, some old debts have to be liquidated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind her, the important material forward index is like the shell that left the muzzle, draw a A beautiful curve, going straight to 100%, or even 200% of the increase! This is the most sure sign of war, and it ruthlessly predicts the arrival of blood and fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The signs that determine the survival of the Elven Empire are steel and horses. The signs of determining whether a free country is independent or not are sea ships and cannons. And the signs that determine this war will be...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One early morning, one of the two behind-the-scenes of the Pure Gold Consortium, "Outstanding Young Politics "Pluto"; Luther went to bed in the yard of the former Marshal House and walked around the fountain. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was dressed in a neat Intre to red uniform, carrying his hands and walking around, seemingly thinking about something. The staff who have just stayed overnight will not be so early, and the guards at the door will not block the officer; even if someone sees this scene, they will only avoid it far away, for fear of affecting the Federalist Party’s reconstruction of Kengler politics. The greatness of order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only sitting on the edge of the fountain is yawning and the sorcerer can hear what her sister is reading - those are defensive detection magic Counter magic, and illusion magic that fakes the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bonnie, is it necessary to exaggerate to this extent? If you want to talk or use your original identity, go to 'Pure Gold' or 'Blue Diamond' The branch here is all right. There are enough anti-detection magic there, instead of wasting six or seven magics like this one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fountain in front of you is actually a permanent transmission point, my sister. I understand it when I say this." Bonnie untied her perfect perfection and restored her original appearance. Now, if someone tries to observe the square at the main entrance of the staff, they can only see the pigeons who have just come to eat and walk around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, understand. Just write down here, even if the transmission magic is out of deviation, you can come back again." Anne in a blue female dress is On the nearby lawn, pick a place where the sprouts are neat, put the dew on the top, and put your hands on the back of your head and look at the morning glow. "The non-artificial lawn is actually not comfortable with artificial lawns... In this place Wouldn't there be a mixture of magical plants?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are at most some harmless little things like exorcism in the vicinity of the church. Even if there is really blood or food. The rot plant is also safer than the enemy's spy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just kidding? Who will spend so much effort to detect our two little people? You recently The new identity is indeed slightly swayed, but it is not enough to motivate the enemy to use the magical level of prophetic magic to explore it. Even misleading is used, is it necessary?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie sat down beside her and calmly replied: "It is necessary. Last week. I made a hand with Sid; Nasser, because he was not familiar with the magic of the plane, let him run. With this person's personality, he will definitely find a way to rule out this unstable factor - just like I want to rule out He is the same as the unstable factor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sid? Who is that?" Annie asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first Minister of Security of the Holy Coman Empire. In our history, he later served as Prime Minister of the Empire, Duke of Soma. Naimen; Hugh; Ke Prime Minister Mann’s first unfortunate predecessor.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny jumped up from the lawn as the bite slammed into the lawn. "You mean, you tried to kill him? Still failed? Bonnie, what are you thinking about? You will pull the entire consortium into the water! For such heavyweights, you will not discuss with me first. ?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...you always feel so arrogant, be careful to lose your hand. The priest who can use the resurrection magic in the world is very rare. If you lose your hand, I can't save you." Annie shook her head and grabbed her sister's shoulder. Seriously screaming, "The assassination doesn't make any sense. Don't do such a dangerous thing any more. With our ability, the confrontation is still afraid of winning the emperor? Even if they hit the city of Lenny, we can find a way to put them. Hit it back, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the eyes of my sister's concern, Bonnie, who was still talking about it, suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her head violently, and rushed out some of the things that had been determined to be forgotten, and retorted: "I don’t seem to stand each other. Say this kind of thing. I don't know who killed the cardinal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde girl is a bit screaming. "Oh... that, it’s Soledon’s killing, it’s none of my business.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is it possible? Sorelton’s level can kill one. Cardinal?” Bonnie snorted, “The Cardinal. Even in our time, this is a high-ranking priest. How is it possible?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's in the anti-magic zone. Who knows that a church in the red dress is coming to attack? Who knows that there will be a princess in the prisoner?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Stop.” Bonnie suddenly interrupted her. “Say it again? You just said, is there a princess? Have you told me about this?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“She Claiming to be Raf; Namlock. Her mouth is very strict. She said nothing except her own identity. We didn't even know which Princess she was in the royal family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Namlock...Keman... You used to be sensitive to the scrabble in the newspaper, sister." Bonnie resisted the smile and debunked it. The stupid nature of the Royal Security Department, "I have a little knowledge of her specific identity. Yes, this will explain why the Security Minister has that kind of reaction. The Empire now has only one princess - she will Will become a great emperor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a name that even Anne will hear. "Olivia; Hugh; Coman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, that is the great emperor of the revival empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Annie touched the back of his head uncomfortably: "...so, the question now is, how do we deal with this hot potato?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her sister Shrugging, with a half-joking tone: "Who knows. Quietly take it to Steelburg, and if we lose, we will use her to exchange our freedom."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We? You have to go to Steelburg? Are you serious, Bonnie?" The sister was taken aback. "So... who is responsible for Lenny's pure gold consortium? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need. We have enough cash on hand, and the consortium has them to operate on their own. Don't underestimate the mistress in our name." Bonnie said, "And you will not want to see the business model of this era. I have already finished the preparation for the money, and now we need our land most." It is Steelburg, not Lenny. To be honest, I am not optimistic about the situation in the early days of the war, especially the army where you and Naimen are located. Hull’s staff has long decided to send them to the central front. Going."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Central Frontline?" Annie asked strangely. "Is it finally going to war?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The staff headquarters judges that the emperor will attack immediately, and the soldiers will be divided into three or four. The problem is that the pillar of the middle road, Stillburg is now unclear, so it is necessary to send a unit to go. Self-sacrificing hysteresis. After the collapse of the Fifth National Division, they could not find a suitable force, but Eugen happened to be at this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Eugen is also a famous player, will he promise this half-death mission?" Anne still doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie chuckled and shook his head: "Please, command the entire Free Army, but the fox of Kengal, he must have a way for Eugen to be willing To perform the defensive task, I thought that I was taking advantage of it. After that, you and Nana will definitely be strengthened into this newly formed team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Worry? Don't worry, he shouldn't be your brother-in-law." Bonnie laughed. "I just glanced at their latest plan for the 'Morning Dew'. They plan to use Clade; the Western Army of Lopez. In addition, as long as the empire's middle road army can be delayed, there will be a huge gap to be utilized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's an adventure The decisive strategy." Anne commented, "Is it too dangerous to use this script?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. The adventurous battle script, the probability of success has never been It’s not high.” Bonnie bounced and stood up. “But how the script is not important, and who is important to guide.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the state Annie's confident smile, Annie suddenly understood: "Do you say... even Eugen will rebel, the empire will attack in your script at this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Of course not. If anyone says 'everything is in his calculations', then he must be a liar. In my script, the enemy It doesn't matter whether the plan is important or not. It is not important for Eugen to bring back to the army. What I need is not the details of the war, just a war. I can accept the wrong enemy in the wrong time and the wrong place, as long as the war It’s just right.” Bonnie waved her arm. “What we need is not the victory of the empire, nor the victory of the free country. What I need is the war itself.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Anne’s face was covered with a layer of frost. "You look like a war-monger now, Bonnie. I can't understand. This war is so meaningless and so ridiculous. There is only killing and no building in this war! Why don't we try to rebuild peace, but we have to participate. This war, even to help?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister, what we want is that only wealthy people have the right to vote, women and the poor have almost no rights, Is there even a so-called 'freedom' state where slaves exist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Of course not!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Then, what do we want is the empire in the north that is full of feudal aristocracy, ** financial burdens, and decaying sacred rights permeating every corner?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not..." Annie suddenly paused. "I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the late Elves, the most serious problem seems to be Who inherited this great empire. To solve this problem, the elves played The successor war caused 30 percent of the elves to die. The establishment of the Coman Empire made this all ridiculous. In the era of religious reform, the most serious problem seems to be whether the civilized world should follow the Protestantism in the South or the North. The old religion, for which we fought five wars in the name of freedom, caused a hundred years of nightmares. The real free revolution and the industrial revolution made this all ridiculous. But we cannot say that the sacrifice of these wars is Insignificant or evil, we cannot praise the absolute peace of nothingness. Without these wars, there will be no progress to change them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie stood up, The tone is very rare and excited. "We are not looking forward to the victory of either of them. We want a new country that is different from the South and the North. What we need is the war itself. It brings Loss is inevitable, it is meaningless in itself, but we can make it the starting point of a new era!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, we are going to Steele Go to the castle, where you can see the sunset of the old days, right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“More than that. Ruhr’s old power system has collapsed, and there must always be individuals. To fill the gap.” Bonnie stood up and exchanged her own camouflage illusion. "In terms of agent politics, Maggie; Veri has done its best, and even the records of later generations are extremely admired for his achievements as a man. However, even with her talent and hard work, still can not Change her tragic life. She is dead, we don't even know when she was killed by the Imperial agents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead?" Anne Surprised to get up, "How is this possible? 'The 'Machiavelli, is that dead?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead. People behind history I can only stay in the darkness behind history, and I have nothing to ask for, no one knows. She thinks she is a big man, but she is dead like a little person." Bonnie bit her teeth, her face is cold, "Why must I find an agent?" What about people? Since the statue of 黛nica can be built on the New World, I can’t see why we can’t.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
