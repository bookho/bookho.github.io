			<div id="content">VIII<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thursday, April 11, 1667雷共和国相港<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Ridge Mountains and Mu The country of Lehman is the boundary, and the world is divided into the East and the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With different beliefs and civilization history, the Western Elf-Korman civilization developed a magic system named after "Arcane" and "God". The Hua-Yi civilization in the East has developed a magic system named after "Confucianism", "Release" and "Tao". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these two great magic systems, the innumerable small magic system flourishes, competes with each other, grows wildly, and is absorbed by these two systems. The two towering trees are poured more vigorously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the evolution and expansion of the Elven Empire and the Holy Coman, in the Western world, the new school developed, the old school changed; the new doctrine proposed, the old The church is bleak. In the end, all the knowledge was condensed into two sciences, “natural philosophy” and “theology”; from the natural philosophy, the arcane was developed, and from the theology, the magic was developed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among all the changes, the magic, the apex of divine magic, has never changed: it is the "miracle" - that is, the state Nee Seifer is now maintaining the magic of her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they are called miracles, the miracles themselves are ever-changing and almost omnipotent. The history of the entire Holy See is the history of various miracles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, arcane, which is the magic that humans have developed themselves, does not have such a recognized culmination of "miracle." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to display miracles is the evidence and pride of Bonnie Seifer, the ninth-level priest; but as the ninth paragraph Master, it is hard to say which magic can be used as pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of the middle of the seventeenth century, more than two hundred spells were identified as nine magic spells, of which up to 80% are no longer nine magic; In the days when Anne and Bonnie lived, there were more than three hundred magic flashes and descended in the list of nine arcane spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are still a few magics that are recognized as the pinnacle of arcane magic. When these magics appear in a magic book, they are usually emphasized with all the capital letters and decorated flower definite titles...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... And danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every top nine arcane arts is a bloody and tearful curse history, can not be glamorously decorated in the history of the church like a miracle . It can even be said that every recognized nine-segment arcane corresponds to an ultimate philosophical question that is difficult to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, "Wishing" (THEWISH) about will and desire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangerous magic developed to simulate the effects of the most powerful magical miracles. The aspirations it can achieve are far more extensive than miracles, but the dangers are far greater than miracles. You never know how a wishing plan is going to achieve its goal, or what it is intended to achieve – even if it is the most powerful arcane wizard of their generation, Anne Sefer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, "THEGATE" about imagination and possibilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great magic that connects all the worlds and all the possibilities, the great magic that connects the odd possibilities into reality, the fantasy and the truth, the past and the Great magic that connects the future, time and space. This is the ultimate form of summoning magic, which summons a world and connects the summoned world to the real world. Most magicians who are good philosophers believe that the connected worlds are objective and real; but many people believe that those worlds may be just illusions, or even just theoretically possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, "Absolute Domination" (THEDOMINATE) about free will and intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For another example... about time, space and everything "THETIMESTOP". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of this magic, even in the future of Anne and Bonnie's original life can not be clarified. Through repeated experiments, the magic theorists only know one thing: even the best magician can't pause more than 42 seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the standard calendar April 11, 1667, when the phase port time is 19:33:42. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie Seifer read the gap in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that it is the "time stop." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, not the time she used stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19:33:42<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or 42 seconds is 42 seconds or 42 seconds always 42 seconds is always 42 seconds<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** *******<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is silent, everything stops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42 seconds, 42 seconds, 42 seconds, 42 seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those affected by Ionette Hartman, after 33 minutes and 42 seconds, it is 33 minutes and 43 seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if this pendulum clock can accumulate three minutes of error per day, the error of the pocket watch used by seafarers is fifteen minutes and twenty minutes. After the end of one second is the next second, there is no doubt about the facts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Cardinal does not know the existence of time stop, let alone counter-attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the 42nd second lasted for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eternal pause, the start of the use of magic items is solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds like a pocket watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the time has stopped, people around will be able to hear the sound of quietly whispering and working in the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of that magic item is to launch a small exile array that covers the location of Ionite and Bonnie Safir. The exile array can be understood as a special transfer magic; it does not solve the complex coordinate positioning math problem, but directly sets up a one-time channel in one position and another specific position in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the line of sight of the time stopr suddenly solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal he wants to banish is already one less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the time stop, at that position, only Ionette Hartman was left alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who stopped using time spoke out "This is impossible!". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of this sentence stays in position, waiting for time to start flowing again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panic sent a long time to visit his mind, a person disappeared after the time stopped, beyond all the magic knowledge he had mastered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a trigger magic? Or is it true that young women who have mastered the highest realm of arcane and magic have a way to counter this time stop? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunter became a prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled out his weapon and mentally left a few seconds for him to face the biggest enemy of his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Bonnie Seifer has captured the gap of time, speculating who is the dangerous enemy of the highest magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the whole world pauses, the world in Bonnie’s eyes is no longer colored, and it becomes a strangely bright color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light stays in front of them and is replaced by the color that the mind applies to everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps this description is not exact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time stop is a magic that is "completely unreasonable." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original meaning of "Arcane" is "to surpass the power of reason", but time is particularly unreasonable among these forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people believe that the world cannot be stopped when time to stop magic. The so-called "time stop" should be just a particularly quick action. Stopping the whole world with one person is a phenomenon that transcends all common sense; no matter how powerful magic, it cannot affect the whole world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even the most advanced physics can't describe the exact shape of the "arrow of time." In the known science, there is no power that can push the time forward – or back, or stop. The best physicists can only admit that the so-called time is actually just a scale, and it doesn't even have a definition. The only thing we can be sure of is that time can be arranged in a sequence, and we can rely on it to separate the events. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, the existence and passage of time is originally a matter of no guarantee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is not only present in objective measures, but also in everyone's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happiness will shorten the time, pain will prolong the time, everyone has the expectation of "beautiful, please stop" moment. Writers can spend a few years describing a few minutes, or they can use a few minutes of description to span a few years, just like a magician who controls time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time stops at first glance, the whole world has stopped moving...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but After all, isn't the caster's own movement and state disappearing from the entire time series relative to the world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are logically equivalent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on this philosophy, future magicians have proposed a new way to stop time--<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the time to fight the soul with the time of the mind, stop with time to stop the time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens when two time stops at the same time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will be free to act with each other, but they will not be able to capture each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not found, but could not capture the other party at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who stopped using time, and the person who stopped the time, did not exist for each other, even the rest of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they can see each other's influence on this still world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who stopped using time saw that the shelf with the emblem was deformed again in a static time. The holy emblems and sacred objects that were originally intended for detection are provoked and turned into powerful, triggered counter-attack chains that will only attack the target specified by their masters when time is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While not seeing the path of the spellcaster Bonnie Sefer, he can imagine the power of this counter-chain. That is, the arcane and the magical art have reached the peak of the realm of the first person in the South, and also requisitioned a whole parish of the sacred object, even if he is an immortal, there is no confidence to defend...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t know how the other party can fight back in time, in the face of such threats, his first step is to put the magic wand in his hand. Excited to cover the vicinity of the emblem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man made the most likely judgment and whispered another set of spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wand in his hand flashed and suddenly unfolded into countless lightning balls suspended in the air, as if these lightning balls were in the world that stopped at that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咦?" Seeing these thunderballs, Bonnie’s scorn is also solidified in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not because the Thunderbolt is too strong, but because it is too weak. These lightning balls are at best the level of five or six magics, and may be able to penetrate the compound sacred defense of a top priest, but it is a joke to say how much damage she can do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting is the time to stop such a high-level magic, but only prepared such a mid-level magic? The special effect of the staff does not seem to penetrate the special effects that threaten her...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, the opponent has not shown her killing, acting like It is only to force her back to fight for time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several possibilities flashed through Bonnie’s mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have he got into a panic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether the opponent is pretending not to kill, The hidden magic, or really no killing, only forced to retreat her, Bonnie could not put any immortal who might be the Royal Security Minister to operate freely in the phase port. In her blueprint for the future, the city is so important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she did not hesitate to flash all the thunderballs, and put a layer of magical punishment within the scope of the entire vault to prevent this person from trying get away. Another big weakness of time cessation is that the relative time that can last is very short, so the caster will always stay within the range of twenty seconds in order to achieve the best results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as the time stops, Bonnie is confident that he will be able to leave that enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42 seconds, 42 seconds, 42 seconds, 42 seconds - 43 seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All clocks start to beat again, and all changes that are lost outside the time arrow and causal chain are simultaneously executed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Group exile!" "Sacred volley!" "This is impossible!" "Hey?" "The staff starts, locates, the dimension crack!" "He falls into Is it flustered?" "Divine punishment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell and the dialogue sounded together and mixed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For people outside of time to stop, these are just noisy noises that suddenly burst out, and they have their eyes wide open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five magics worked at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first magic sent Ionette Hartman, who was still standing in front of the emblem, away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second magic action takes the Holy Emblem into an attacking machine that automatically launches the Holy Rays. All the beams were shot at a man in front of the vault door, but were blocked by countless lightning balls on the path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie Seifer stood just below the thunder ball, staring coldly at the mantra behind the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a young man with a big body, glasses, cold eyes and good looks, with a smile on his face, wearing a low-end The priest's costumes look like an unremarkable church instrument. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people’s sights are like entities, colliding in midair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s all the “sure” look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that the enemy opposite is Sid Naser, who also knows that his opponent is Bonnie Sefer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid in the hands of Sid, a clutch that is quite familiar to Bonnie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her goal is to destroy the immortal of the phase port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the other’s goal is to retreat, plus as much as possible to weaken the combat power of the phase port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning that he realized that Bonnie could stop the time, Sid had given up the will to continue fighting, but deliberately showed weakness and made himself panic. The illusion of being easily defeated, tricking her into staying in the vault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder those lightning balls are so weak, because at that time Sid Naser used it is not his own magic! It must have been that Sid used some kind of magical item to make a weak thunder ball, and at the same time opened the dimension crack! Fortunately, she is Bonnie Sefer, who last successfully avoided the opposite crack, and this time she has prepared the necessary magic. Instant state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dimension anchor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Bonnie’s ability to instantly cast such a high-level spell, There is no change in the expression of De Nasser. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yellow invisible anchor line flew out of Bonnie's fingertips and hit the ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, the huge dimension cracks were forcibly opened, pulling the entire vault into another world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Silver Dragon Mara sensed that the following changes occurred from the top of the building, the stairs that appeared in front of her eyes were cut off from the stairs and the empty half. floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The treasury, the sacred objects, the gates with protective magic, and even the slabs and ceilings... all disappeared, leaving only the ugly broken bricks exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who uses magic is probably very familiar with the size and shape of the vault room. His range of dimensional cracks just covers the inner walls of the room and collapses! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the floor of the ruined wall, only a large group of imperial expatriates who were thrown out of the crack and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hartman Qing? Your Royal Highness Sefer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Princess of the Empire is also from the building When I came to the top, I saw this scene and almost fell from the disappearance of the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Ionette Hartman and Bonnie Seifer disappeared, no one knew what had happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, they don’t know why they made this huge void, but the murderous prisoner used magic to get rid of the inside of the floor, walls and ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only person who knows the original is now through the crack of the dimension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This guy only saw that I used it once, and actually learned how to deal with the dimension anchor! He dared to measure the size of the entire vault in advance!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ridiculously acidic and foggy land, Bonnie climbed up from a pile of broken bricks and shaken off the mud. The golden dimension anchor line on your fingertips looks like a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...From here to return to the phase port, it seems a bit far away? Forget it, since there is no immortal, the rest of the things are resistant to the door and Marshal Wayne They should be able to get it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phase Port Westport Phase Bridge Bridge Head<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Bonnie, Sid, and Ionet disappeared into the crack of the Dimension, Nami Soleton was commanding to clean the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the power of Anne's Soulstone, the battle of the bridgehead is generally over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although only once, Naimen felt that his magic and mental strength were drained like pumping. The cold and desperate mood poured into his emotions through the soul stone. It wasn't Anne's memory that he had been talking to him. He felt that he was being pulled to the side of the undead army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the empty desert wilderness, endure the resentment of the yellow sand weathering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the boundless open sea, experience the resentment of sea water to rust the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resentment against the unsuccessful elves. Resentment against the betrayers of the vassal state of the elves. Resentment against the Komans who ran rampant over the territory of the Old Elf Empire. Resentment of the Murrayans and the Orientals who enjoy the rich land and destroy other small religions and tribes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is resentment against yourself. Resentment against one's own obsession. All kinds of people are clearly the victims of the revival of the empire, but they still have to fight for the resentment of the undead emperor after death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wave of emotions washed away, almost let the door can not hold Anne's soul stone; fortunately, memory of Curry Anne's memory has a certain ability to judge, The order was cut off when he was about to support it. Fortunately, the overall situation of the battle was fixed at the time; but suddenly the loss of the huge restrictions on the undead of the audience, or the people of the Seventh Fleet Sea Forces suffered a lot. loss. The main force under the door is the cavalry. It is responsible for the work of pushing the enemy into the sea, but it has not suffered much casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the battlefield is being cleaned, the commander of the Seventh Fleet Sea Corps will come to discuss it in person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Warlord has made you, why did the suppression of the gods suddenly stop? If you want to stop the suppression of the magic, can you not let us know first? You know how much we paid extra The price!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the killing of the door to the teacher to ask the sin is actually the Seventh Fleet Marshal, the flagship captain and the chief of the sea corps Wei Buwu, the door is not Consciously short three points. The young marshal is much older than him. His accent has a strong oriental flavor. Many language auxiliary words and modal particles have been omitted. It sounds sharp and direct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, it’s my fault. My ability is not enough to drive this repression for too long, it seems to bring the backlash of the undead will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door will answer his own feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Buwu’s brow slightly rises and seems to be looking at his eyes. From the body of the Seventh Fleet, there was a natural pressure; it was because he was born to be the son of Wei Taiping, the reason for the person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now another powerful enemy is attacking our military port. I want to know, can you still provide a similar support again?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door hesitated for a moment, reaching out to hold the soul stone in his pocket and quietly asking if Anne’s memory could come again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be kidding! If it wasn't for me to cut it off in time, you would be pulled directly by them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory library has rarely expressed intense feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, that's probably a one-off." Nanimen shook his head against Weibuwu. "But I also have cavalry, pastors and not many. Infantry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The entire coast near Westport, except for the one we rescued, I am afraid it has become a production base for undead." Weibu Wu sighed To breathe, "Is it really impossible to provide support? At least, when dealing with the main force of the enemy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry." The door can only shake his head again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your chaplain told me that it was probably the demon of the Archbishop Bonnie Sefer. As far as I know, the Warlord is not a pastor. I haven't received any theological training in my resume. Can I ask why such a powerful magical item is not entrusted to a bishop who can withstand the resentment and recoil of the undead? Or is there any way to contact the Archbishop of Sefer? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Buwu still does not give up. The impression that was given to him just now was too deep. He had never seen such a sharp, powerful and effective suppression of the undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is frowned. He can feel the warm flame of Wei Buwu's heart that is completely different from his father. Compared with the old man who has been honed by the sea for many years, Wei Buwu is a kind of commander with passion, justice and ambition. At least, his will to save the civilians and his own fleet is sincere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
