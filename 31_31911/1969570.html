			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xx<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world does not rotate around some people, nor for some people And stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History is like a river, it does not hesitate to advance for certain purposes. Although there have been repeated and some twists and turns, it has progressed slowly and firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the big time, everyone’s life is a magnificent epic. The great times are full of darkness, but they are also full of light for the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rice; Quillahia." The blonde girl smiled, and the right hand gently released pure magical power, "Mage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meliyahna; Quillahia." The girl with linen hair smiled quietly, and her left hand gave off some white light, "Protestant pastor and mage."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the elf empire unified the Western civilization, there have been 1,650 years. In the middle of the 17th century, it was an era when the storm was coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Historicalians from later generations..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Exactly, two After a century and a half."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some butterflies follow the tide, some butterflies go to the storm, and some butterflies fly in the storm. And the world is a storm, and no one knows what will happen next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The story of the story is very simple... Hey, Bonnie, let's talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am? A man, met a woman. The man is a monster that has lived for two hundred years, and the woman is just an ordinary person. Then they fell in love... Then they separated. The woman studied magic and decided to find it. The man’s whereabouts... well, the synopsis is like this.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butterfly from two centuries has begun to dance in the storm of the Enlightenment. The sapphire pendant flutters in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this narrative too simple?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will have time to talk later." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the end of a story and the beginning of another story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's over." The iron wall admirer who knew nothing about what happened on the deck was lying on the lower deck without any grace, caused by magic. Fatigue made him only want to sleep well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "bishop" who inexplicably escaped his life--exactly, the real Lord Ferdinand--after the wounded, he also relied on the cabin Rest on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a good weather." It seems that the old-fashioned Lord is looking at the sea and talking to himself. The sun in the afternoon is projected on the turquoise waters, with a soft light. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three days later, the elf sailing ship "Kleon Emperor" entered the port of Ellivi under the escort of the friendly ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only a week away from the summer solstice. Even the central port of the west coast of the mainland and the southernmost end of the frost line are filled with heat waves from the south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, the sun is hanging in the middle of Tianzhu, exposing this elf-style port city. The prosperity of the Old World is in stark contrast to the simplicity of the New World. Among the three walls and the fortresses of the coast, there are at least 120,000 people, of which 60% are citizens. Among the ports, hundreds of ships of different sizes are moored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Emperor Klein" sneaked into the harbor with a frigate that belonged to the Fifth Fleet while carrying the hottest time. Its appearance has been completely different from when it sailed from the New World, and there have been traces of hardships everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original new black-green canvas has a variety of strange patches, all in the eye-catching position of the mainsail and the upper sail; People who are sailing structures can also see that there are quite a few places where there are no sails at all. Needless to say, the hull is no longer a solid black wood with scars of various colors. Even the most important masts have traces that have been broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That was a hard fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in retrospect, the captain of the sea corps, Leonard; Kikawi will still be secretly surprised. What a powerful opponent is that... If it didn't happen to conquer the pirate captain, it might be that the whole army would be overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, it’s a blessing to win that guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half Frowning, glanced at the man behind the hanging hammock and sunbathing on the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former pirate is ranked eighth in the rank of the big pirate, Kazmi; Stewart is completely unaware of being a prisoner, with a recurve samurai sword all day long Dangling on the deck, from time to time, it’s going to be a curse - if Leonard is supervising him all day, this guy may have been tempted to change his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes Leonard even suspected that he was wrong at the time and would allow the guy to keep the weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it for? What? Forget it, don't let it be so big..." Now, this self-proclaimed to be "the most loyal subordinate of yours" The man is one of the two things that most trouble Leonard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another one? The other one is naturally his secret love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard is now staying outside the cabin of the person he admires, and he has long been unable to count how many times his little finger has been hit. The alchemist has not come out in two days, so he has no chance to return to his own ring...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......by the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s finally finished...this is a masterpiece!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Door, use your left hand to block the sunlight that shines directly on your face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her right hand, she is holding the golden magic token that has just been improved. The magic rune above the scepter is four times more than the original; now, the scepter can be transformed into a third form of combat. It took only three days to complete the study, and she is in a good mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good afternoon, Reza, you always figured it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear the hatch When it was ringing, Leonard turned and leaned back on the guardrail to say hello to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have been here for a long time. Is there anything?" Reza noticed that the neckline of his military uniform had been soaked in sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm...this..." Leonard said nervously, "There is something important..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Reza said slightly reddish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elves hesitated: "That, the Chief Bishop of Hartman asked me to retrieve his 'Covenant Arbitrator'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the corner of the distance came the familiar two heavy objects fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resa stunned, her face became a bit ugly, and turned back into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Transformation, Warhammer!" The operation command sounded loudly in the room. Afterwards, the alchemist walked out the door with a rather heavy silver sledgehammer and lost to Leonard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Receive it." "Covenant arbiter" slammed on the floor in front of Leonard, causing a dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard was a little embarrassed, picking up the sledgehammer and saying: "That, actually, I still have one thing..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say it." Reza's tone was very cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... remember the ring that I asked for you, Reza?" The half-elf hurriedly turned to the topic and wanted to ease the atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza frowned: "What do you say? What ring?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before the naval battle? Do you have to give me anything?" The expression on Reza's face was very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He licked his head and sneaked at the right hand of Reza; the right hand of the alchemist did not bring any ring. He held a glimmer of hope and turned his head to look at his left hand - nothing on his left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...ah...that, then there’s nothing wrong with it, maybe I remembered it wrong..." Leonard’s face became very red. Hurry and leave with a hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the corner of the distance, two very heavy objects were heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, it’s your sister who is responsible for eliminating the memory of Reza? Did you eliminate something that should not be eliminated?" Bonnie; Phil grinned and sneered, laughing all the time on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister Anne pouted: "Hey! You are so bad... I am confident in forgetting magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although at the time they had a whim to tell the truth, they were rushed to remedy the problem with Forgetting Magic afterwards, and re-masked their identity as ordinary trainee mages and pastors. After all, the origins of future generations are hard to tell. In the event of a heavyweight opponent like the Arbitration Association or the Holy See, the interference with history is too great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is really hard to say," said the brown-haired girl with a smile. "Do you feel that after returning to this era, the control of magic has been Falling? Some particularly sophisticated future generations of magic can't be used."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, especially the arcane, especially obvious...maybe two centuries worse Why? After all, in our time, the global artificial magic net and magic repository have been built."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I think not only those and The magic associated with modern miracles is affected.” Bonnie shook her head. “It seems that most of the magic that has not yet been invented is difficult to use, and the magic is consumed much faster than before.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, it's just a matter of saving it. Anyway, we don't have to use magic." Anne replied optimistically. "Even without magic, we still have two hundred years of knowledge and The understanding of the history of this era!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Change too much history. Now if there is a mistake, your 'timeless affair' will be spoiled, my sister. "Bonnie warned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne caught the hair: "But, so far, it should be perfect. Anyway, the fate of important people has not changed much, only one The Duke of Soma should not be a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hope so." Bonnie smiled faintly, with a hint of anxiety in her smile. "But, the memory of Machiavelli we have not eliminated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the very least, as in history, we still hide the secret of her identity. It is really difficult. Imagine that Machiavelli would be a woman..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When talking about Machiavelli, Anne remembered the sentence she left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are all the same, but you are better than me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar? And the woman who used the identity of a man as a cover, completely without any means? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No...should not be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t want to unify the world, nor does she want to build her own empire. She does not have to resort to any means, she has her own moral bottom line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong, what are you thinking?" Bonnie raised her finger and shook her sister's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing." Annie closed her eyes and shook her head. "We should be ready to go ashore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Thank you very much for your escort. The soldiers of your ship suffered heavy losses. We deeply regret this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are welcome, this is Our agreement has long been negotiated and the losses are within the expected range. After all, the preparation of the mysterious enemy is too full."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the end, we all completed the task and wished it all the best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wish you all the best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;At this time, Leonard; Kikawi was holding a silver hammer late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that he actually appeared now, Fei Long bit his teeth, as if he was going to attack on the spot; but he immediately remembered something and took control of himself, not letting Anger broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I seem to be late." The half-elf held the hammer in both hands and handed it to the chief bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, I have been waiting for a long time." Io took the hammer easily with one hand. "Deformation, dagger!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Covenant arbiter" flashed and became a dagger form; Ionite put it into his robe . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a hunch, I will meet you again in the future. I will meet again." The silver-haired man no longer delays, sitting with the Lord he protects. The boat, crossed the shore. Inside the port, you can see a very large-scale escort, about half a battalion of 500 people; the flag of the Guard is marked with the emblem of the prominent Soma Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the two of them successfully landed and entered the protection of the escort, the people on board were relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s over." Leonard sighed. "It’s all right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Is it all right? The half elf smiled. Isn't this the final outcome of the separation unexpected? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A warm, heavy hand that fell heavily on his shoulder. Leonard turned back and saw the face of his boss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As far as I am concerned, I didn’t appreciate you very much. In this voyage, you did create a lot of trouble and still catch it. The pirates who arrived at the brothers and sisters should have been given the punishment. The loss is so large that someone has to take responsibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the content is unrelenting, The tone of the "iron wall admiral" Baron Leutstie was not as indifferent as usual; this made Leonard quite surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you have a hard fight, have you turned?" The captain of the sea sergeant secretly groaned in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, since you can make such a decision, I will grant all your requirements. If there is a responsibility, I will do everything." In the eyes of Fei Long, there was a slight tear in his eyes, and he shot the shoulder of Leonard hard. "I am really a narrow-minded person compared to you who can sacrifice yourself for the benefit of other people... Maybe I should change it too. I changed it. If you change your mind and want to go back to the Sunshine Navy, I will do my best. This farewell party, I will treat you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Leonard smiled warmly as a response: "Where, you have won the prize..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait, wait? ! He jerked back to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the requirements?! Responsibility?! Back to the Sassen Navy?!Farewell party?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; This sounds like how you want to be blasted out? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Men, Baron, are you doing something wrong?" Leonard tempted to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No?" The baron took a piece of paper from his arms. "This kind of sincere petition letter, I feel very touched even after I read it. They Even if you don't take any hard labor, just don't have this prisoner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard grabbed the piece of paper and frantically browsed it. He skipped all the gorgeous words and only paid attention to the key words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, Leonard; Kakawi, willing to pay for their military duties... In exchange for the lives of these pirates, only let them serve hard labor and repent Your own sin... and the achievements of the soldiers of the whole ship... Please conceal this battle on your behalf... I will take responsibility for the people who surrendered to me... I would like to resign from the captain of the Sanctuary and the Fourth Fleet. A position. May the gods protect the saints."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
