			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard Calendar April 19, 1665 Beixinzhou Tosca Grassland Yin, there Gale <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the pasture begins to reveal sprouts, the Tosca steppe begins to wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wind is blowing from the West to the sea in the east. Once this wind begins, it will not stop, and it will continue until the next winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meteorologists of the later generations, this wind is called "Southwestern Tradewind." Merchants, it is called "the wind of trade" because it broadens the voyage from the New World to the Old World. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever the wind blows, the proud Tosca will know that it is time to start grazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walked out of the winters of their respective tribes and returned to the prairie where they have been inhabited for generations, where they graze cattle, sheep and monitor lizards. On the grandfather's grandfather's generation, the slender little white-skinned humans came here and brought the horses to the Tosca people. Therefore, the Tosca people thought they were the messengers of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, Ma has also become the target of Tosca grazing. In order to thank Ma for this great gift, the Tosca decided to be friends with the messengers of the white-skinned gods forever. The wise men of the tribe decided to give the land that was not so long on the coast to God as a gift and reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before possessing a horse, the Tosca people rode a special monitor lizard - they used to call it a war lizard. The warrior lizard looks a bit like a dragon (due to the lizard's bloodline), how tall is the height of a person, and the Tosca can ride on its back. This kind of animal, the fastest speed, is not fast, and there is no strong lizard, but it is better to manipulate. Nowadays, most Tosca people have started riding horses, and few people can see the battle lizards like their ancestors. Only those Tosca fighters with outstanding skills and high strength will continue to fight on the battle lizard. The gods gave them a good name, called the "lizard". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best warrior in the Tosca tribe is known as the "lizard knight". A tribe has five real lizard knights, which can already be called a big tribe; two tribes, three five lizard knights, will be respected by all Tosca people; The tribe of even more lizards is the owner of the Tosca Prairie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, there are at least five five five-horizon knights gathered here, as well as horsebackers and walkers several times behind them; behind them It is a continuous camp, and it is not clear about the camp with the Tosca counting method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past ten years, there have not been so many warriors on the Tosca steppe. Most of the soldiers are carrying bows and spears behind them, and most of them hold huge stone axes or warhammers. They don't need swords, because they don't have so much metal to smelt -- and their opponents are not suitable for dealing with sharp edges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heights of those Tosca opponents are only half of them, and it is not easy to find them with a sword. Although their height is not high, their combat effectiveness is not low. With the customary name of the Old World, these people are called dwarves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf is best at smelting metal. Although they can't directly smelt a lot of steel, a small amount of steel and iron can be a good hand. Most of the dwarves wear heavy armor, and it is difficult to hit them directly with a sword. Instead of cutting with a sword, it is better to use a hammer to make it effective. The armor can withstand the sword, but it can't resist the fracture caused by the impact. Similarly, the dwarf's weapons are also very sharp - because most of the Tosca people do not wear armor, the horse will not wear the stables, the sharp edge is the most effective weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge army of the dwarves is listed on the other side of the grassland. From this point of view, they can't see their army. Because the height problems are covered by grass, they can see the flags flying in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feud of these two races has been around for a long time. Whether it is the dwarf or the barbarian of Tosca, the elimination of the opponent is the highest goal. Before the discovery of the New World by mankind, these two races were doing endless killings on this continent. Already, I don’t know why until a long time—perhaps, it is a natural and inevitable conflict between dwarves who depend on farming and mining for survival, and barbarians who depend on nature and grasslands for survival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t know that this kind of feud will lead them to be used by conquerors from the East and the West in the years to come. This prairie will belong to the conquerors of the East and the West, not the aborigines here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lizard knight is about 150 people, the cavalry is about 1,200 to 1,500, and the infantry is about 2,000 to 3,000. It is probably the total strength of the three tribes; according to the number of enemy flags, There should be seven tribes and twenty-seven families, with a total strength of between 1,500 and 4,000.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leisha Ermont looked at the lineup of the two sides and probably calculated the strength of the two sides. It seems that the barbarians have a bigger chance of winning. However, the dwarves already have firearms technology, which is to be considered. As a member of the pioneer, she is very clear that self-insurance is the number one priority in any situation. Every year there are thousands of people from the Old World who have forgotten this code. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These barbarians, also use what 'five' 'five five' to count, it is too backward. Don't say the enemy, even the number of friendly I can't figure it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her head helplessly and glanced at the huge figure around her. It doesn't matter, as long as he is there, he is safe. As an alchemist, she has no less than 50 bottles of various potions - even if they are all used for attack, they should be enough to protect themselves. Especially the blazing rubber and the elf burning water, this time quite a lot, just waiting to be used to build a fire wall to chase soldiers. In her twenty years of life, she has not really faced the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as you finish the business, you can pay off your debts after you go back. This time, two hundred flaming rubbers, two hundred elf burning water and two hundred bottles of therapeutic syrup plus one anti-konjac and seven thousand five hundred pieces of fur were shipped. It is obviously a good business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adding to the fact that these barbarians promised to give me double pay after winning the victory... Maybe they can redeem the family title."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She cheered herself up and began to fantasize with so many furs when she returned home. Those magical goods dealers who are profit-seeking, those who are debt-seeking as the usurers, will certainly regret the future of the alchemist Lisa who treated the future; Hermont's...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Take out all the best gems and solvents! Fine gold and cold iron! Warren Hite hand-made thermometer, Garick's latest aspirator!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, she can also buy it as confidently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the saying goes, "The barbarian shoots a bow and arrow to kill, and the rich shoots gold coins to kill." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She raised her right hand and laughed and shot the imaginary gold coins into the distance. This action immediately set off waves in the barbarians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Behold! God's messenger ordered! We should not wait for those who are late, and we should take the enemy in front of us into pieces!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice behind it pulled Reza back into the real world and almost fell off immediately. As soon as she pulled the reins, she turned back and saw that the most prestigious elders of the tribes were yelling at the people of the tribe. The age of the elders is not small, but the sound is still not small enough for the surrounding knights to hear. The barbarians who heard these words couldn't help but repeat the words of the elders. They shouted at the same time and passed the slogan to the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Step into pieces! Step into pieces! Step into pieces!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On behalf of us Ska's great commander will lead us to kill those short scorpions under the guidance of the gods!! The proud big lizard chief, red wind, come and speak to your subjects!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders continue to shout. As before, all the knights let the mount lift the front legs, shouting loudly, repeating the words of the elders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red Wind! Red Wind! Red Wind!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lizard knight from the middle of the team Crashed out and walked to the middle of the battle. His lizard is obviously bigger than others, and the colors are different: the general lizard is green and his red is red. Legend has it that at the age of seven, he tamed the red lizard and used it as his mount--from then on, the Tosca called him "Red Wind." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today he is wearing the red iron konjac that he just bought, and the whole body is red, which is extraordinarily good. He firmly believes that after the war today, all the tribes on the prairie will be unified under his banner--the tribes, like the white people in the east and the dwarves in the west, become empire with a unified power. That is the goal of his struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the red wind is full of anger, and every barbarian warrior can hear it. It was a very short speech - it could be said to be the shortest speech in history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Victory! Victory! Victory!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one word, but the word is passed In the hearts of every soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red lizard turned around and the rider on the top made a beautiful movement on its back, which was as natural as a flowing stream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this loud noise, more than a thousand horses are stepping on the same The lizard is also ready to go. Because the horses were somewhat afraid of the lizards, they were placed in the first batch of assaults, while the lizards were arranged in the latter position as the strength of the second batch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"吼!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time as the last bang, a Thunder jumped across the clouds. The rumbling thunder set off the bark of the barbarian, and the momentum was enough to shake the world. The red wind allowed the entire horse team to start the assault with the lizard and control the rhythm of the horse's charge. The entire battle grabbed before the raindrops fell. The cavalry must not fall into the mud, and the battle must end before the mud falls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"吼"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for Reza to react, her mount was carried In the middle of the ocean where the cavalry charged, all the way forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite of them is the star-like splendid spear tip and the volcanic gun array that flares like a wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who haven’t seen it may be hard to imagine how powerful a thousand cavalry charges are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numbers don’t look too big, but even with a multi-line formation, this line stretches to a kilometer long – a one-kilometer long death line. The speed of the cavalry charge is about the same as that of a modern car. Imagine a car that is one kilometer long and rushes over to you...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of the dwarf, this scene is even more frightening. The legs of the other mount are longer than their height. Therefore, the ancients would say that a cavalry had eight infantry. The barbarian's cavalry has more than a thousand feet, and it is reasonable to trample these dwarves all the way like ants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the family here is the oldest and most honored family of dwarves. Most of their pedigrees can be traced back to the dwarves before they reached the continent. These families have fought with the orcs for generations and have accumulated countless experiences and courage. The dwarf firmly believes that "the experience is stronger than the armor, and the courage is sharper than the blade." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More, today they have another advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first shot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order is of course in the dwarf language, but listen Some accents and pronunciation errors. The person who commands the order seems to be splitting the words of the dwarf into a syllable to pronounce - perhaps that is the habit of his native language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When heard this order, the dwarf officials waved the flag hard and passed the order to the front row. More than two hundred and thirty lead shots flew out of two hundred and fifty guns and shot at the barbarian army that was hitting here. Even if you remove the jammed, the remaining bullets are enough to form a bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The musket! It is a musket!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams of horror are among the barbarians' queues It sounds. Dozens of horses were shot, and some of them took the rider down. Then, these horses and people were trampled by the cavalry in the back. Seeing such a flesh-and-blood scene, the alchemist was a little disgusted and rushed to use the magical "arrow shield" that could withstand the flying objects to a certain extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Change shots!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first line of dwarves quickly after shooting Disperse on both sides and go to the back to change the spear. The dwarf, who was originally on the second line, stepped forward and pulled the gun of the arquebus. The fire rope burned for about 5 seconds and detonated the propellant in the barrel. The distance of this shooting is much closer than before, and the effect is obviously much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed ​​is the most important relative to loss. If the firearms complete the new filling before they arrive, they will lose them; on the contrary, the victory is under control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two columns are back, three columns are ready to shoot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third column of dwarves' equipment, It is obviously different from one or two columns. Among the three dwarves, there were a few black iron pipes that looked terrible - a shotgun. The armor worn by the dwarf warriors in this column is also lighter than the first two columns, and the caliber of the firearms in their hands is larger than that of others. At this point, the cavalry's front line has already rushed to the front of the dwarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fighting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overwhelming lead particles popped among the cavalry. The three columns are equipped with shotgun lead pellets, which are also used in the artillery. The range of the rifle is not as far as the lead, but it is far superior to the lead of the musket. All the barbarian warriors who rushed to the front were almost beaten with blood - countless tiny lead particles passed through their bodies and the body of the horse, which is absolutely fatal at this distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian cavalry has lost a whole row in a flash; many people who have been in the third row of the original have been affected. The power of the three-shot musket attack is astonishing as ever. The lead bolt that fell like a raindrop made some of the cavalry behind it linger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is only a moment. More barbarian cavalry was not deterred by such casualties, but accelerated to the dwarf's battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rush! Their Musketeers, there will be no resistance soon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as they are killed, the prairie is ours!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian is well aware that it is impossible for a musket to launch a second round in a short time. The dwarf's three tactics, which they encountered as early as ten years ago, did cause a lot of damage at first; but later, the barbarian found that as long as the charge distance was short enough and the speed was fast enough, the three tactics were nothing more than One-time tactics only. Now, seeing that the three columns have been fired, the barbarian is ecstatic and ready to rush forward to smash the musketeers. This distance, even if the third column wants to change to the back, is impossible...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but today is the most elite of the dwarves . They are responsible for different tasks than in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abandon the gun forward! Pull the knife!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following commands, and the barbarians envision It's totally different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf in the third column dropped the musket at the same time, pulled out the long knife, and tumbling forward, and most of them slammed their warhammers and tomahawks. Empty. Those dwarfs who are not afraid of death are rolling between the horseshoes - their sad heights make them more flexible, and the disadvantages become an advantage. The silver knife light flashes mercilessly between the unprotected horse legs. Although many of the dwarves were trampled to death, the barbarians who were caught off guard were even more devastated, and the battle was one less row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oriental artisans are often arguing whether the tactics of "the knives" are effective or not: they finally come to the conclusion that this type of play Although it is not guaranteed to defeat the cavalry, it can drag the cavalry's combat effectiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the situation today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fourth and fifth rows of cavalry catch up and use the powerful to open the road, most of the dwarf's musketeers have retreated to the back - the sacrifice of the third column, giving The entire phalanx has won valuable time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using this time, the dwarf’s most important order was issued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All members raise the spear!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one command, the action is "唰" It’s just a cry. Countless spears were erected at the same time, stopping on the road where the barbarian cavalry marched, and the gunpoints all reflected the cold light. Another flash of lightning flashed, the cold silver gunpoint array looks like a star. Deadly stars. Unlike human mercenaries or goblin guns, the trained dwarf infantry never breaks - a spearless array of spears that can stop any horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the battle of the Tosca cavalry, Resa stumbled into the spear. The fur riding technique that I learned in my hometown has long been scared to the clouds. Now she can only make up the reins and ensure that she does not fall off the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but be grateful: If there was a foresight, I would give this horse a bottle of taming potion, and I’m afraid I’ve fallen off the horse too long. The cake is gone. The previous firearms can also resist the magic of reflection magic and ordinary flying objects; if the knife is close to the flesh, the magic of an alchemist is definitely not enough. Most alchemists only practice some of the magic that aids in manufacturing, such as enhancing ability, creating a solidifying effect, changing the nature of objects, etc. Other magic has never been valued by alchemists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that she was caught in the tall barbarian, the dwarves gathered in her direction; each seeing her dwarf could not help but attack the direction. Change to her direction. Countless spears, surrounded by Reza, almost smashed the key to her. If there is no barbaric people around to fight, she will probably become a pool of clay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... What are these dwarves going on? Why are they focused on attacking such a weak woman like me? I am obviously shorter than these wild people... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza swears at the horrible attack, and is puzzled. Her golden staff in her hand kept sending out small protective shields to resist the piercing of the spears. The golden cloak has been smashed, and the magic of the golden head ring and the golden necklace on the neck is almost exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't go on like this anymore, I will die here if I go on like this! I have to find out why I am the target of attack..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, she can’t hear the other’s orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Focus on the person who is golden all over the body!" The strange accent made the command in a dwarf language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More spears stabbed at her, the cavalry around them fell into the horse, and the dwarf smashed and stepped on one foot. I don't know when, the barbarians around the guards have almost disappeared, and only the enemy is left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Reza blocked the shot with a magic shield. The green magic shield is cyan, and it seems to break over the limit at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Usage stick, she blocked the spear again. But this time the spear hit her arm, her arm hurts, she released her hand reflexively, and her staff fell underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the two spears hit her horse. The horse screamed and yelled and threw her down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can only look at the last spear to her, all in the ear is the voice of the dwarf cheers. With only seven or eight hundred casualties, they have smashed the two hundred and two cavalry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, this work, should not be picked up?...? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden darkness in front of me. Something blocked the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"铿!铿!铿!" Three sounds of gold and iron, all the spears that were stabbed to her were blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge, two-person golden shadow breaks through the dwarf's battle at an unusually high speed, stepping on every dwarf who dares to resist, She is protected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resa saw the huge figure appearing around her, suddenly regained her vitality, jumped up and muttered a spell against the golden figure. The dwarves only saw it at this time. It was a huge gold golem--activating battle creature that advanced alchemists could refine. As the spell was pronounced, the belly of the magical dummy opened, and she immediately jumped in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha! It’s time for me to fight back! Go on, Ganda! Give me a step on them! Let them see the pure gold alchemist. 'The great!'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, the reason why I got this nickname was that she did not hesitate to choose the high magical rate of "gold". The alloy of the material acts as a magic material. This directly led to Leisha; Hermonte was in a state of lack of money all the year round. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
