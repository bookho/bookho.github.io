			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xi<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is the largest country in the world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only and permanent power", "The true God and the covenant of the covenant", "the commonality of the civilized world", the sacred empire (skorman empire). The Empire was founded in the 4th century and has existed for more than a thousand years; it will be extinct at the end of the 19th century and will exist for more than two hundred years. In its heyday, it ruled nine out of ten civilized worlds; today, half of the territory of the civilized world is still under the ruthless millennial empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is the most powerful person in the world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of people will answer that they are "the Holy Emperor"; in fact, this is not the case. For the young imperial emperor Gustav; Hugh; Coleman, there are many things that are more important than complicated trivial affairs, such as various routines and diplomatic negotiations - because the emperor is a symbol of imperial majesty. The real power and daily affairs are in the hands of the Prime Minister and his cabinet. Regardless of how the prime minister is replaced, the Prime Minister still manages this huge country. The administrative center of the empire is not in the Palace of Light, but at 15 Covenant Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winter of 1665 was a rare winter, and at the end of November, the port of the imperial capital, DeLand, was frozen. In the cold northeastern season, the prime minister of the empire was the elders named Ekasalgen; von; icosvon chilingburg. The Earl of Tallinn has to be white, and this year is 53 years old. It is a veteran of the Three Dynasties. Ekko Sagan served for Gustav's grandfather, Leden, his father, Orestein, and the regent's uncle, Direstein, for many years; after the death of the Regent, he served as the Prime Minister of the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As usual, Prime Minister Ekosagen handled official documents from all over the country and intelligence from around the world in the Prime Minister’s residence at 15 Covenant Street. Recently, the imperial government has many things to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next Duke of Soma, Ferdinand; Hugh; Lord Soma is about to hold a grand succession ceremony, the invitation has been sent to the capital, all the celebrities are necessary attend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest event of the Orthodox Church, the 14th Taranto Conference was entered into the 16th Agenda Year, and the dispute between the reformists and the conservatives is still not over. sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year’s Imperial Golden Mark recast is about to end in a week, and it is necessary to calculate the proceeds of the current coinage tax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And... Prime Minister Ekosagen flipped the official document and saw a document that was tied into a tube with a black ribbon. On the ribbon is a line of words "Ikea Sagan Qing Qin", and a magic seal - if you want to use magic or force to force open, it will pull the documents together with jade. His eyelids jumped: the Royal Security Department, very dense. The Prime Minister of the Empire did not have the authority to administer the Royal Security Department, which was the document that the Emperor directly forwarded to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister took out his own ring and pressed it at the seal of the ribbon, and the ribbon was quietly ashes. He opened the document written on special philota paper, which is a typical scribe: clear, clean and easy to understand. The title is equally concise: "The weekly report of the Lenny Division." This kind of report, by convention, will not be sent to the emperor, and will be filtered out in the hands of the savvy and strong security minister, Cid Nasec; if it is necessary to copy it to him...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Ekko Sagan began looking for the highlights directly in the file. Soon, he found it, a total of three. "There may be civil strife in the south in the near future", "the rebellious army is frequently mobilized" and "the crops in the Ruhrlock Republic are good." Looking at these intelligence items, the Prime Minister picked up the coffee and tasted it while thinking about what might be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you say that...who is going to...when there is a civil strife in the South, declare war on the South?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this possibility, the Prime Minister’s hand could not help but tremble, and the coffee spilled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperial Emperor Gustav; Hugh; Coman is 24 years old and is a generation that grew up completely after the last free war. There is no doubt that he must have inherited the blood of the royal family of Coman - from Arthur; Hugh; from Keman, the patron saint of the Coman family is the god of destruction and war Corrier...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-three years ago, when the fourth free war broke out, he was young and accompanied by the young Emperor Orestein. In the South Conquest, he wanted to solve the problem of the South once and for all. Twenty-one years ago, in the siege of Steelburg, he desperately faced the sea of ​​artillery of the Freedom Army, guarding the spirits of the Emperor... At that time, Steelburg was still an old-fashioned castle, not A new type of bastion. Until now, he will do that nightmare from time to time. Although "the blade of no front" Kongti; Marshal Fox has retired, but the fear of the Free Army is still hidden in his heart. Prime Minister Ekosagen is fifty-three years old and still cannot forget the cruelty and terribleness of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the emperor insists on this, what should he do? Most of the young courtiers did not hesitate to fight the South, and they intended to wash the snow in 1644. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please, please don’t give me an excuse to start a war. It’s enough for me to experience a war in my life.” Prime Minister Ekosagen Put the coffee cup in your hand down, stand up and look out the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May the gods bless the empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slumber of a team, chilling Cried, flew in the direction of Lenny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if it is already early winter... you can also see geese and chills. Where did they fly from?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne; Sefer sat on the already yellowed grass, staring at the sky lazily, revealing a tired look that was not consistent with age. The sun hangs in the sky in the east, and the high cumulus clouds are scattered on the blue sky. It is indeed a sunny day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will always be some lazy and confused guys who make mistakes about the time they should be. There are geese in this season, wouldn't it be weird?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her sister stood behind her and said in a slightly ironic language. However, if you don't listen carefully, you can't hear the irony from her delicate and gentle voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you talking about me?" The blonde's sister licked her hair with her left hand. In three months, her hair grew a lot longer; the younger body, the metabolism is indeed faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I am reminding you." Bonnie turned to her sister's front, kneeling, smiling and staring at her. Anne felt like she was like a frog stared by a snake. "Today is December 7. You are escaping from reality, sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't!" Anne retorted the triumphant heart, " I work hard every day!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie held her chin with her hand and nodded. "That's good... Then, the answer? If you don't escape the reality, you should have an answer now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde girl licked her lips and will My eyes moved away: "Oh... not at all, there is no escape. At least, I am not bored to go fishing in the garden's fountain..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Following her gaze, half-elf Leonard; Kakawi is lying lazily on the edge of the fountain, leaning against a coal stove, staring at the fish in the fountain and yawning. Since moving into the mansion, the former sea corps captain has shown the nature of being lazy and too ordinary, and most of the things are given to Kazmi to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie smiled helplessly: "But I don't want to talk about him now, but you. Sister, tell me - Naimen; Lopez is Naim; Hugh; Coman? I just want to hear your conclusion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This question..." Annie caught her hair. Various methods have been used, enough information has been collected, and the person has been followed for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even then, she still doesn't know, the door is good; what kind of person is Lopez? The real name is Zalt; Fran's defectary mage is an ordinary and complicated person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is an ordinary businessman, doing clothing business with little relationship with magic, and occasionally using a few small magic to adjust the turnover and life fun. He is a third-rate magician, even if he teaches his apprentices. The friend whom the two sisters met, Janica; Lopez, the daughter of Lopez, often complained that the new magic of the door was taught halfway back to the book and tutored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still a good man who cares for his family. He quietly manages his home, that is, the welfare home. He will help the nuns to do the sundries, buy food, and pay for daily life, and also save money to propose to her. Prepare; he will sometimes be a prodigal son, will be filled with rogue bar street, spend a night without return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion? Naimen; Lopez is somewhat like "the man" - but she can't assert that he must be "the man." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." Annie muttered. "He may be, he may not be... I can only say that it is a man like him. "That, do you like him?" Bonnie’s questioning almost straightened her heart. It’s time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An instant, Anne wants to answer this. Guessing is like gambling, and if you miss it, chances are you won't have another chance. She is indeed at the door; Lopez, or Zalt; Fran’s body saw a trace of that person...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembered what she had seen The wedding ring that passed. The ring is amethyst, which contains magic and is very beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...No." Annie replied decisively, "To destroy other people's love, I can't do it. Just treat him as not."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough, your sister won't go to cross-cutting love." Bonnie's smile seems to say "I already knew it", "So, about What should we do tonight's coup?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still don't interfere. After we eliminated that person, we have no clues... then I had to let the coup appear as usual, so I could find the real door to the door; Hugh; Coman." Annie replied, "But before that, I still have something to ask you. Maybe it is a bit late now, but... ...Is there a list of areas that will be burned in a coup?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her sister smiled and took a map out of her pocket. "Hey, I already knew that you would ask this. This is a list of blocks that might be burned, and a place that fits someone's fake autobiographical description."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Bonnie, you are awesome! It’s my sister!" The blonde girl flew up, grabbed the map, and kissed her sister’s earlobe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown-haired girl has a red face - although she knows her sister, she has a different face and body. "That, we should leave, my sister, the store should have been opened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton was woken up from his sleep, and there were a lot of messy footsteps outside. And gunshots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" The young man blinked, pushed the door open and went out. A large group of soldiers - about half a company - are lined up and trained in the yard of the welfare home, headed by a dwarf. This dwarf knows: It is Clade; Lopez's follower. In other words, General Lopez should be nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come today so early?" Soledon patted the dwarf's shoulder and asked: "Is it usually not in the afternoon? And, So many people come today? What are those?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Immediately? It’s noon right away." Tug turned his head and recognized that he was the young lady of the generals. He grinned. "Ah, it was the gunpowder and shells that I just received. We originally wanted to ship it back directly to the station, but the general said that it was too far to be transported back to the station. It would be better to put it here first. After two days of winter exercises, Can be used."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Winter exercises? When?" Soledon asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "About next week, it is the first exercise of our secret weapon force. These days may be harassed, but we will pay for food and accommodation. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man glanced at the tent set up in the yard. There are about 10 or so - that is, 20 soldiers will live here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Uncle Lopez wants to pay for food and accommodation, give it to the teacher. The nun will not accept it because she is not a miser... ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low baritone came from behind his back. The boy turned around in horror and saw his teacher standing behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resistance and tolerance teacher!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some people have mastered two paragraphs Magic, I don't recognize the teacher. The young man is really sighing..." Today's Zalte; Fran, not wearing the black robe, but put on a dress. A black dress with a tie is a bit sloppy. It seems that he also deliberately shaved his beard, and the usual shackles were swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, I absolutely don't mean this..." Soledon hurriedly defended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, joking with you." Zalt took care of the tie and said with a smile, "Is it strange that I changed my clothes today?" In fact, I have good news here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. Are you finally asking for marriage, teacher?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough!" Zalt coughed heavily, sensibly touching the small box inside the jacket pocket. "It's not this, it's another good news. St. Grace's Welfare House doesn't have to be relocated!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?! How is this possible?" Sorelton eats Amazed. The news that St. Grace's Welfare Institute was to be sold, they all knew it long ago. In order to raise funds, the new church sells money for important churches such as Westminster Abbey and Pope Cathedral; as for the secondary building of St. Grace's Welfare Home, it is listed as a must-sell. . A few days ago, Soledon and Yanika were preparing for the younger children and persuading them to accept the fact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey..." Zalt smiled smugly. "I and Verentina bought the land."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hah?! This, at least 100,000 pounds? Do you have so much money?!" Soledon exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"80,000 pounds. I have 70,000, and Wei Lun has 10,000, just right. The eye of the bishop is coming out." Zar I made a special note. "That would be one of the most impressive scenes in my life. Let's celebrate it tonight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live This is really something to celebrate. Right, did Nika know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...she seems to go out early in the morning? It seems like Go to 'Pure Gold' to play there. You sleep late as usual, presumably you don't know." Zalt indulged, thinking back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton volunteered: "So I went to find her, and by the way, I bought some food and came back." After that, he reached out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zalt frowned, touched his pocket, and took out the money: "Hey."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton looked at the poor two pounds: "How important is the celebration, how can I have 10 gold coins, teacher?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "...take it." Zalt reluctantly took out a gold coin from his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager took the money with satisfaction, smashed it in his hand and threw it into his purse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today is really a good weather."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two weeks have not come, new things still Really a lot... This purple seems to be good." In the "pure gold" manager's room, Yanika; Lopez is carrying out her Taobao business in a huge sample cabinet. When the door-to-door store went out of business, the “Pure Gold” Amoy underwear was one of her favorite entertainment activities. "Ah, that sea-blue lace side seems to be good too..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come time is coming today? Is it not open next door?" Accompanying her Asked Anne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The teacher and the nun went to the church, and the old guy suddenly appeared. I just had to escape." Yanika dialed the ponytail. “It’s so annoying to run around early in the morning to get rid of people’s lives.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Recently awkwardly? Was it not reconciled last time?” Sitting at the desk is busy, but Bonnie is listening to the conversation here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
