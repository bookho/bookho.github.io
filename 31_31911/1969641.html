			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xv<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd is a strange thing, they are sometimes fanatical and blind, sometimes indifferent; Sometimes it is scattered and sometimes indestructible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they are ordinary people, they each have their own personalities: some people are filled with indignation, some are arrogant; some are hesitant, some are eager Some people stepped forward and some fled. But after the sudden bloodshed, all these personalities have come together to form the same kind of reflection: disorder. Gradually, reason began to lose, and the slogan of nothingness drowned the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It happened. It finally happened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of a bad situation, young Lieutenant not only did not feel disappointed, but he was relieved. He had long guessed that the elections that were so close would not be resolved peacefully, and they would end up with riots and conspiracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few months of failure and tempering, there is only one thing he really learned: to be prepared for the worst-case situation at any time. At the same time, plan for the worst situation. Although things may not be as you think, it is not a bad thing to prepare a few sets of contingency plans. Even the best situation may suddenly turn sharply, not to mention the situation that is not so optimistic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has long imagined the possibility of potential opponents making riots in Kengal. He has seen more than one riot and collapse, at Lenny, in Fort. People who live in perfect order on weekdays, comrades who care for each other like brothers on weekdays may turn into helpless lambs, greedy robbers, crazy perpetrators or unrelenting enemies. Once this storm breaks out, there is no way to stop it, it will only cause permanent scars and hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days, Nanimen has repeatedly recreated the riots in his mind and night nightmare. After countless failures, he painfully admits that his limited strength and mediocre ability is far from enough to turn the tide - except for one method. That method is not legal or moral, but it is the only feasible method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the riots began, they were scared and controlled and dispersed by the Thunder at all costs. As long as there are no more people, potential perpetrators - or killers - will not have any chance. It’s just a handful of people who really enjoy violence. They don’t give them the chance to control the danger to a minimum. To this end, he has carefully studied the messy items that Anne brought to the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All-in-one expansion! Hold the stink cloud to the front line, and the people who dig into the ground to excavate the fortifications, people who hold non-lethal weapons Control the commanding heights, the reconnaissance team's notice to follow the team to dispel the crowd! At the fastest speed, use various means to disperse them, the injured person handed over to the follow-up company! Never let any group of more than five people pass our blockade!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some reactions from the soldiers who heard the orders of the official chiefs who did not order them on weekdays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the first line?" "Where is the construction of the fortification?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ground grabbed the flag from the company's standard-bearer, raised it high, and made a line in the air, and loudly ordered: "Follow the defense here! Cast the stinky cloud bomb on the opposite side! You use the tunnel to erect the paving stones!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers hesitated, looking at the flying flag of the trench, and moved. They rushed forward in chaos in twos and threes, throwing out the stinking clouds in the hands of the mob in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clouds that scented the rotten eggs scented in the crowds that were coming to them, inspiring countless violent coughs and screams. The civilians who could not stand back had retreated and ran out of the sphere of influence of magical weapons. Only the well-trained Ruhrs soldiers maintained their formation. They also felt flustered and tremendous pressure, but did not dare to act freely before receiving an order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lieutenant! What do you want?! Cough... Dispel the stink cloud! Prepare all the armed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The first thing he reacted to was his Eugen. He tore off the holy emblem from his chest and grabbed it in his hand. With his hands together, he used the magic to blow away all the green stink clouds in front of him. The door was bitten, and he ignored the threat of Eugen, but continued to convey his own orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this order with double meaning, several non-commissioned officers did not hesitate to take out the scepter, pointing to the opposite crowd and not many dozens of government officials. Anne’s actions were faster than his orders. She had already hypnotized the two supervised government soldiers who were watching. Her brother and Machiavelli stunned the other two by fists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop, Solayton! What do you want?!" Itis and Govar, who have retired behind their defense, almost simultaneously shouted his last name. But the door is still deaf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick! Be fast! What else?...have it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them, he remembered the pure energy that he saw last time in Lennie. If it is the kind of earthen curtain... I think of it, the door is rushing to the side of the paving stone that has been thrown aside, grabbed a soldier’s shovel, and held it across the ground and swept it out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do it with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order is straightforward. In just one moment, the soldiers understood the chief’s intentions. The earthen curtains of the sky provoked and slanted to the crowds, and everyone in the hustle and bustle could not open their eyes! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who support the autonomous party have already started to run away. Naomi knows that the arrogance of these rabble is close to the limit, only the last straw. The last one. With his sad magical ability, there is no way to add straw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please. Anyone, dispel the crowd!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paving stone was last seen by him The waist was cut off and it hurt his hands. At this moment, several loud shouts broke out in the crowd on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's too dangerous here, let's go back! Don't die here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Run fast! How many lives are not enough to pay here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not get involved in the battle of the regular army! See how many mages they have!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last straw was more than one, but three, and the camel was crushed in an instant. The three inflammatory sounds almost burst out in the crowd at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear and chaos swept the hearts of people in an instant, and they felt timid in front of the confrontation of the tower shield, the muzzle and the regular army. The protesters on both sides screamed, flew, pushed each other and trampled apart, and each rushed to their home. They fled in a few minutes, leaving only the yellow fog and the opposing army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door patted the dust on the body, climbed up from the pit, and left the excavation that had already exhausted the magic to the side. How could he not know exactly which three people understood his intentions, but it didn't matter. He succeeded. The next task is to solve the misunderstanding with the other party and take everyone away safely from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, it was really forced by the situation..." he shouted, raising his hands and heading to the opposite position, trying to work with Eugen and Govar. Explain the purpose of your actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what he didn't take into account is that now on the entire front, only one person is exposed outside the shield wall and the bunker. Only he alone attracted the attention of the other party - the critical moment will be serious, faster, more accurate than anyone else. Now, Eugen has borrowed a sword from his guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, we are also forced by the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen heard that Eugen Hang Lang said locally Out of this sentence, only to see the white light flashed in front of me. He instinctively hid to the side, but the blade with the light of the Holy Light was wiped from his left abdomen. He has seen this trick, and Eugen used it to deal with Robert; Ayr-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that he is not Robert, he is not capable of this. The gyro sword is flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are probably a few small organs that have broken, and they are quickly falling into the dark. He heard four screams and confusion. Govar and Itis’s voice is blocking Eugen, and a few footsteps are quickly approaching him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no way... I have to use this." Then, there was a young female voice that he couldn’t tell but was familiar with in his ear. Prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naimen stood up with a mistake and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small numb sensation is not comfortable, and the soft white light massages the whole body. The scars and wounds of large and small disappeared instantly, and the large wounds in the abdomen also healed rapidly, and even the left eye recovered vision. Fatigue and hard work are swept away, just as refreshing for twelve hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is it? He was a little confused, but the rest of the people were surprised to see the caster. The most surprising thing is Ega, who has the status of a patriarch; Major General Eugen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are also a priest? It is impossible...too young. Are you affiliated with the innovation society?!" It is found that the other party may be a senior priest, Eugen's The attitude has softened a lot. Originally, he was very fond of this sly playboy, but now he has to re-correct his opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the name of all the gods and the revolutionary associations that convey their will, we all stop. Since the crowd has spread, what can't be done well? Talk about it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pluto; Luther, or Bonnie; Seifer with a simple smile, his right hand holding the emblem, blocking The front of the entire company blocked the situation from further deterioration. Even her sister, Anne, did not know why she was exposed to her senior pastor status - she had not received any notice beforehand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking of it, both of us are really not like clergy, General Eugen." In the blink of an eye, from the politician to the clergy The son opened the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eugen, who was shocked by that magic, did not listen to him at all, just muttered to himself: "Complete treatment... I heard about it a while ago. The rumor, I didn't expect it to be true. I finally finished..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that the boss is not ready to use now, and Itis hurriedly inserted: "So Let me talk about your unauthorised armed entry into our defense zone. In the agreement, is there not expressly stipulated that neither the Imperial Volunteers nor the Lenny Army can enter our defense zone? Lieutenant Soledon, how are you doing this? Explain?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a big feeling: “Because the politicians here are personally threatened, we are here on request! How can we say that we are Entering without permission?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute. You just said that you should ask?" Bruto jerked his head and stared at the eyes of the door. Whose request?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course it is your request. The secretary rushed to ask Of. "Resistant door startled, quickly excuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Secretary? We haven’t sent anyone to ask for help..." He followed Ninmen’s gaze and noticed the weakness of the politician’s secretary. messenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger is timidly hiding in the corner. Seeing Luther's gaze, he shook his head madly and shouted: "Not me! Not me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie, who disguised as a man, was not taken this Performing deception. She magically pulled out a beautifully decorated, grungy pistol with a lot of gems from the coat, pointing at the man. "I have never seen you, who are you? Just before you shot the opposite people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, not..." The man is crazy Start, turn around and want to escape along the already empty street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute! Don't run!" Yanmen hurriedly shouted at another company that came to pick up later, "stop him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough." Bonnie did not hesitate to squint at the wrist, all the gems and gold and silver wires on the gun were lit up, and the projectile flew out with a blast. The projectile fluttered and swayed to the target. When he was about to hit, the man suddenly disappeared out of thin air - sinking into his shadow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The disappearance of the movie?" Anne, "Pluto" and Machiavelli both exclaimed, they all read this to make the entity disappear Magic in any shadow. As long as there is a continuous shadow, this magic allows the operator to move through the shadows at a speed that is unimaginable to ordinary people. Machiavelli, who is good at the shadow field, immediately lost an illumination in that direction, letting the natural shadows disappear and trying to get the person out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will disappear in the shadows... Who is he?" Machiavelli stared at the fading light. "Is he the mysterious counselor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sudden change made everyone silent, and finally Marshal Govar broke the cold. Seeing him again, Itis wanted to pull him, but was gently opened - the action was very soft, but it was difficult to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, you can be relieved of this crisis. Although this violates the military rules that the Free Army cannot fire at the nationals... but you do I am very grateful to you. Without your decisive action, it may lead to a greater tragedy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the Supreme Commander of the Governor The official said that everyone around me was stunned. What he said was not consistent with his position. According to common sense, Govar should be held accountable for their unauthorized entry into the Medibishi Division. Only a few people know that this "Raditz; Gowar" is actually a young woman; only one person has guessed that this "Gowar" is not completely on the side of the governing government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But," Govar’s words turned. "As a soldier, I don’t want or care about politics. I will never interfere with this. The elections. There are many people who support Mr. Brighton. You may be very embarrassed to stay here. Even if you really submit the election dispute to the court, you may not be able to take advantage of it. If you leave immediately now. Matterby will not do anything to interfere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing his words, the Federal Party’s Chairman of the Phild and the Liberal Party’s Machiavelli’s face Exposed disdain. Both of these people have been playing for many years in the political circles of Ruhrock. They are confident that there will always be a way to win if they have the advantage of the method. They don’t want to give up now. But now Lusser is speaking. They are not slick, they will not interrupt other people’s speech as much as Govar. What they didn't expect was that Luther's choice was completely unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay. We will immediately evacuate the city, before Chase releases the next strong statement. Thank you for your generosity." He turned around Come, take a shot of Soledon’s shoulder that just stood up. “Gather all the troops in the city, let’s go out of town.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Wait a minute. Nikolay; Machiavelli stopped him. "Why are we going to evacuate? We won the election!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes" we won the election in name '." Luther solemnly corrected, "In the past you know, this situation should stay here to fight to the end. But at this very moment, we must leave, the sooner the better. Now the Central Army Where is the team, the door?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, this is a military secret." Resident Yuhua hesitated and looked at Annie and replied. Anne immediately noticed, and gently said this position in the ear of "Lüser cousin". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this position, Luther was shocked first, then returned to the usual expression, and explained to the colleagues seriously: "The situation is very delicate now." We must act fast. I know that you all have a lot of questions, but please don't question, follow us to evacuate. This is the decision I made with the officers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; His words cannot be rejected by others. Politicians are skeptical, only Metty; Cross cautiously asks: "That, we will be fine, Pluto?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Everything is under control," Bonnie said, feeling Metty's hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, all the guard towers and the loudspeakers on the clock tower were activated, and Chase was broadcast; Brighton was full of inflammatory The second statement. Obviously, this is a new statement written after he got the news of the parade to incite the parade. The tone has completely changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The army supporting the Federalist Party has invaded the city and they tried to arm the election. It is clear that only the Federalist Party with a support rate of 30% tries to manipulate It is unreasonable and unlawful to obtain the ruling power of the system, and it is even less in line with the agreement reached by the three parties. Why can these politicians use their public opinion to support them? Why can they suppress the real majority through digital games? The Republic of Turk has never admitted a new amendment containing these criminal provisions! These people tried to destroy the autonomy of Ruhrlock through various means, we must not tolerate it! The people who support the autonomous party, unite, surround them, defend the Republic Let us drive out these ambitions that violate the sovereignty of the people from Kengler!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original legal basis is this. The agreement only declares the succession of the election law, but did not declare the succession of the election law amendment. There is still this trick!" Machiavelli said with hatred, and apologized to Luther. "Sorry, I just made a mistake. If that person is here, she should be able to see through the other's plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie nodded and accepted him. Apologize: "It's not your fault, but you haven't seen that person yet. Chase didn't intend to win us from the beginning. However, it is impossible to come up with such an idea with his ability. I don't know who it is. Give him advice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are really quick. If this statement is five minutes earlier, everything will be different." Annie said it. The voice of everyone. Then, she asked with a worried look: "What should we do now? Soledon, do you see it? Are we going back to the rescuer department? Or as soon as the other side suggested, rush to Voltkagler and the main meeting. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s probably too late to go back to the rescue division. If the spies are imperial, now the Imperial Volunteers are definitely in our division, and we are rushing back. It doesn't help. It's safe to flee to Voltkagle, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is worthy of these two choices, hesitating. The electoral officers of the division cannot rely on them, and they will certainly surrender quickly; but they will not be reconciled if they flee to Vodkagrad. In improving the assessment of junior officers, interpersonal relationships are more important than ability or merit - but the former is something that people like him can't count on. If he withdraws, he may even be taken as a scapegoat by other officers. What he needs now is merit! Enough to let him leave the front line and go back to the high army Academy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An idea suddenly poured into his mind, how can he not be expelled. It’s dangerous, but it hides huge opportunities. He lowered his voice and asked his adjutant and the politicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think we have a chance to attack each other's residence now? Do you mind if we risk it with us?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feald and Machiavelli’s faces have changed, but Pluto is faster than them, and they have said their opinions before them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think this is a good plan, it may be safer than fleeing to Voltkagle. If you are lucky, we may catch a few hostages." How many times do you have a grasp, lieutenant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I leave now, I feel that there is at least 70% confidence." The troops we sent out had a total of eleven or two company teams, and there were nearly two thousand people together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I don't mind taking risks with you. Nikola, Lord Fred, what do you think? At least, in the camp of the Imperial City, we have basic fortifications and artillery to use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pluto's voice is low, but with a faint intimidation. In the past three months, he has rectified the government's chaotic finances in this way, and no banker in Kangle has dared to disobey him. Two politicians with a higher status than him could not find a word to refute, but nodded silently - while giving up other free army still in the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then let’s go." See no one objected again, and Annie nodded. "I am going to gather other companies."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than a dozen companies in the city scattered around, and now only three can be seen in the naked eye of the door. It is not easy to bring them together. But Nami believes that his sub-family is perfect for this task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All go to the East Gate!" He re-started the flag of the company from the ground and screamed loudly, in order to let Eugen and Govar hear their movements. He knew that he was sitting and watching the rest of the division slide into the abyss, but he also knew that he could do nothing about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Radetz; Govar" and Itiseye sent the warrior's troops to the east gate. The major sighed, and the "Marshal" sighed; their faces were not so good. Itis got together in the ear of "Marshal Govar" and whispered, "I am so arrogant that you will not be appreciated by the gentleman. The gentleman should have already arrived in the South, but we have not seen it yet." It’s only him... Ah, I don’t even see the gentleman.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I don’t care about your evaluation. Originally we were just contractual cooperation. Relationship, isn't it? You didn't tell me any real secrets, you shouldn't want to destroy my mouth." The girl disguised as Govar changed her voice back and answered with the volume that only the other party could hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
