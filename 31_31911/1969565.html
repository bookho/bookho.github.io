As a cross-bow double-barge, one of the specialties of the Quasi-Angel is sailing against the wind. Vessels with vertical sails are good at headwinds and sidewinds. They can adjust the sails to take advantage of the wind in different directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the rules of naval warfare, it should have begun to circumvent, but one of the vessels is completely unlawful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bow of the "Kleon Emperor" and the stern of "Dano" are tightly connected by the passage of the steel, and no one can move . The superiority it possesses is completely offset by this disadvantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this situation, Katzmi; Stewart laughed from the bottom of his heart: "Although I don't know how you did it... but thank you , black robe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the samurai sword from his back and slammed down a corner of the table, venting his inner joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open fire! Give me the target to sink!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the big pirate The laughter, the remaining artillery fired together, and the black cannons flew to the hull of the elf ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All lying down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big scream yelled out the order to make the entire artillery deck The sailors on the ground avoided the enemy's shelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hull of the "Kleon Emperor" stunned in the powerful artillery fire of the other side. Entangled by the obstacles of the bow, it has no right to struggle. The lower deck is filled with the smell of dust and gunpowder smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feron; Letonsti took the ash on his body and stood up. The tidy Nassen naval uniform was dirty and could not see the color. Look around and be surrounded by a mess. Three shells landed on the lower deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much is it dead?" The first-class baron calmly asked the first officer. no response. He looked down and looked for it. The first officer was smashed by a shell, and his flesh and blood was blurred. He was already out of gas and had less air intake. The sailors around also climbed up from the dust, and when they saw the first officer fell into a pool of blood, they exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, the Elf nobles shouted: "All listen to my orders, return to their posts! Report the remaining artillery!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has a face to face, and few people have seen the true face of Ferronna's elegant appearance. Gunners and sailors have rushed back to their posts and reported on the status of their posts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right 2 is in good condition, 1, 3 is destroyed!" "Right 4 is in good condition!" "Right 5, 6 is destroyed, 7 and 8 are in good condition!" "Right 10, 12 is available!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are six more?" Ferron sighed and picked up the telescope. "I really have trouble... The pirates, too, have become like Dizza. It seems to have to be serious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding where he came from, he found a gold saint emblem. That was the secret research of the only Sun God of Sassen - only a total of 12 were cast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sun god, Joseph, above all else, gives your servant an eagle's eyes, and unparalleled luck."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Emblem is ashes with his prayers. While the Holy Emblem was turned into ashes, he also issued an order: "The 2nd, 7th, and 12th guns fired, and the elevation angle was 13.5! The rest of the guns were ready!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The shells flew together, only one hit the outer wall of the "quasi-angel", and two fell into the nearby sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kazmi smirked: "This kind of hit rate is really sad. Three doors are eight, I won, Elf!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron wall admiral seemed to hear the pirate's madness, whispering and whispering to himself. He waved his hand and issued a second round of orders. The tone is astute, and the content is surprisingly detailed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. 4 gun position, elevation angle 14 degrees! No. 8 gun position, left 2 degrees, elevation angle 14.5 degrees! No. 10 gun position, elevation angle 14 degrees! Immediately fire!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The round of shelling was all in the middle. One of them even hit the gunpowder barrel that the quasi-angels piled up in the corner! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Quasi-Angel" raging fire is reflected in the eyes of the elf captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fallon said in one sentence: "I will never let go of those who anger me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Old, boss, no! The fire spread! The lower deck can't keep it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kezmi licked the blood on the sickle, that is Incompetent gunner's blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? Why do I lose to a broken ship that can't move? Why?!... Oh, yes, the kit. I still have a third. A kit of tips."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first tip, telling him that he should take advantage of the prevailing east wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second tip tells him that he can be defeated and then kills and fights to hit the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third kit, there must be a way to victory...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the gambler who lost his eye, he did not hesitate to tear open the third kit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a waste to lose such a good condition. The second-rate piece is a second-rate piece, which makes me have to take a conservative approach... I should see the third "There are some tips?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karben; the black robe sees the fire of the quasi-angel, through the small porthole, a slight scorn in the corner of his mouth. "I have long wanted to say that the feudal superstition of the East is not good. How can it be considered all?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you have already torn this brocade Pouch, you have not saved. I wish to go all the way to heaven, now pray. - Once a partner, Karben; black robe (of course a pseudonym)"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Seeing such a message, Katzmi violently smashed the note with a kit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't believe in God! I will use my own strength to kill a road for you to see, black robe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, is there still a road now? Is there a road? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment of the millennium, a flash of light flashed through his eyebrows. Katzmi saw the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there is a road. The road is there! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Full sail! Turn left at 15 degrees!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened? You are here What to do? Enemy?” Annie helped the woman with the light green hair to catch up with the half-elf, and saw him wandering around the porthole and asked strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We won." Leonard replied faintly and turned and asked, "Is everyone here?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team leader stepped forward and replied: "All are! We have confirmed the safety of the hostages, basically no deaths."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "So, everyone is ready to pass through the enemy's passage! The enemy has sneaked into our mothership..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for Leonard to say At the end, the huge steel passage suddenly shrank, and quickly retracted to the other side of the ship, leaving only a huge hole in each of the two ships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dazzling sunlight penetrates through the hole and shines in the lower cabin of the two ships. The elf's sea corps captain was finally able to meet his real enemies for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you!" Leonard asked with a hilt and asked loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nikolay; Machiavelli lhiavelli." You should have read my information?" The black robe man turned and left the last sentence. It disappeared into the shadows deep in the cabin. "Be careful with your back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Manipulating the Heart's...?!" Upon hearing the name, Leonard jerked back three steps. The back slammed into the wall. Anne around him also took a step back and seemed to be shocked by the name. The scimitar in his hand almost fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the sea corps now understands why his subordinates will die unclear. Because the opponent is "manipulating the heart" Machiavelli. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called "in-law" and letting the other party kill each other is a good thing for this man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nikolay; Machiavelli, the great magician who has a great accomplishment in the creation of new magic. According to top secret information, the new magic created by this person The field is likely to be related to the taboo of mental manipulation. Extremely dangerous! No priests should be careful not to engage in close combat! Note: Machiavelli may have a female partner, but this cannot be confirmed."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret information of the distant sea fleet he had seen before was written. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why...why would he appear here personally?" The cold sweat on the forehead's forehead slammed down, and his unlucky hunch was fully fulfilled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a trap, a complete trap. All of them have caught this trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, will there be more arrangements? How deep is this trap? How many heavy institutions? Are there any other volts? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this, Leonard doesn't know at all. Everyone around me becomes very suspicious in an instant...especially...especially...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! Then, the boat crashed!" Anne Cried out loud. Her shouts pulled him back from panic and confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No... I want to be calm and calm. I have to be calm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up Seeing the "Quasi Angel", which was almost swallowed up by Honglian, violently slammed into "Dano"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oriental proverb says that if you put people in an environment that will die at any time, you may find a way to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Killing on other ships to escape life - that is the only way to find out of Kazmi. If he wants to escape from death, there is only one choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ships were connected in a loud bang. Now all the ships are tangled up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retracted the passage, Machiavelli quietly walked in the cabin passage of the Emperor Klein. Several pirates carefully followed the man's back, and a sigh of voice did not dare to send out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a voice blocked him. It was a crisp, sweet, but full of powerful female voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop! Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Machiavelli has a fixed look, golden light shines The big beauty is shaking his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reesa; Hermonte holds a golden scepter in his hand, pointing to his position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am, I am a normal sailor passing by." The second secretary of state smiled without a hurry, and the smile contained a strange power. "Can you tell me where the pastors are?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The pastor? The pastor may be in the captain's room..." I don't know why, Leisha subconsciously answered this directly. The problem of "ordinary sailor" is as if he is really an ordinary sailor, not a strange black robe man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, then I am gone." Machiavelli turned and prepared to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie came up from behind and saw this scene. She hurriedly took a look at Reza's shoulder: "Wake up, what are you doing?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp With her shot, Leisha suddenly woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No... you, you are an intruder! Just now... are you a fraudulent mage?" The memory of the female alchemist was running fast and confirmed immediately. The identity of the opponent. The basic ability of the fraud domain mages is to say ridiculous lies that people can easily believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! It’s been seen." Machiavelli still smirked, and the magic accumulated in his right hand was sent out without any warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"rayblindness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black blinding beam directed toward Leisha The eyes were shot, and the alchemist was black in front of his eyes, covering his eyes with his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this opportunity, Machiavelli rushed to her. He was exposed on the hands outside the black robe, wearing a pair of strange gloves with magical coats of arms - now the gloves are surrounded by the cool blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Power paralysis gloves...?" Bonnie saw the pair of gloves and lost the voice. "You are Machia..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I just want her to take a nap. I don't kill women." Machiavelli's tone is still very easy and polite. He could not hear that he was carrying out a sinister and sinister attack. Seeing that no one can stop the hands...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to the last few wooden steps, the deck of the Dyno is in front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing Anne’s reminder, standing at the top of the stairs, Lena Dejianjian picks and picks up the big axe from the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cut! This seventh is not cut! It's good!" The enemy with the big axe jumped backwards, flashed and bounced back. The fine sword, praised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard noticed that the other side had only one eye. He looked around with the light of his eyes, and the deck was already corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are warriors with Elf Seamen, and pirates with scimitars. Only two or three of the first squadrons were still alive, and the blood of the fourth squadron had already dyed the pedals leading to the "Kleon Emperor." The "Kleon Emperor" can still resist, leaving only the mighty golden golem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard felt dizzy in front of him. Such a big loss, even if you go back, you have to go to the military court...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-eyed dragon waved his bloodied battle axe and laughed wildly: "The storm captain, Hehn! Are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'The throater' Kikawi." Leonard reluctantly calmed down and answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"‘Throats’...?! I have heard of you. You are very famous.” The one-eyed dragon said, with a eager radiance in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, fame is also very annoying." Half-elves talk to themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After killing you, I can also be on the list!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Cyclops The hands in the hands of the big axe squat down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the list of rewards, what can you prove? Prove your evil?" Half-elves satirized halfway and found that the situation was not good. He curled his knees and escaped this powerful blow. The sharp blade of the giant axe squatted on the deck of the ship and cut a thick crack in the thick poplar deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solid ship board, even with ordinary shells, is hard to cause structural damage; the power of this man is really amazing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha! Prove my strength!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herne re-raised the battle axe, again Killed to the half-elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows, the man’s courage exceeded his expectations. Although the left wrist has been penetrated by the tip of the sword, he still forced to use the right hand to hold the axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really tenacious!" Leonard praised, his left arm was stopped, and the arm shield was used to forcefully block the cross of the Tomahawk. "But don't underestimate the shield cast by Saint-Sen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K! The arm shield shook, completely removing the force on the big eye of the one-eyed dragon, leaving only a horizontal strip that was not very deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...Impossible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't wait for him to be surprised, Leonard's fine The sword pierced his throat accurately. The tip of the sword with blood, from the throat of this fierce one-eyed dragon, avenged the six Saint-Sensiers who had died under his axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if you can't get on that list, you'll prove that you are weak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the scene, he checked his shield. Even with such a large force, it is impossible to penetrate this shield...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is such a big force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute...why can I pierce?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly remembered One thing... this thing made him feel chilly from head to toe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, but I don't mind killing men."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alchemist suddenly opened his eyes , answer coldly. Her eyes were so bright that there was no sign of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long whip form!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden scepter of Reza’s right hand shines It turned into a golden long whip and danced with a whip flower, blocking the way the black robe man marched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Machiavelli slammed back, flashing the attack range of the long whip, and muttered: "Why is there nothing?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, there is a thing called a mirror... Metal is polished and barely replaceable." Reza explained as she strolled forward. The whip in her hand danced a gorgeous trajectory on her own, forming a sturdy invisible wall that forced the man in black robe to step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a smart weapon?" Machiavelli did not panic, and continued to take a ride without a hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah. Do you see my wrists moving?" Reza smiled and went up two steps. This whip hit Machiavelli. The left hand inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around them watched their battles stunned—especially those pirates. Such mage battles have completely exceeded their understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no way, I have to go. Thank you for the information, beautiful alchemist." After that, Machiavelli waved gracefully. The surroundings suddenly became dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"blacklight! You stay here to block her!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!" Leisha hurriedly stepped away and left the area covered by the darkness of darkness, for fear of being attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black light only dissipated after a long time. Of course, Machiavelli has long since left – and no one else has stayed here to stop her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, it’s a coward. You say yes, Bonnie?" Reza looked around and looked for her slave b. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the quiet and docile brown-haired girl, I do not know when it has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bonnie? Bonnie? Bonnie!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that moment, she remembered What Leonard said to her before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is impossible...the captain's room!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the sacred shield of Sassen can never be of such a poor quality that it can be pierced by a fine sword with a holster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless, that shield was specifically intended to pierce him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless, that shield is a trap prepared to remove his sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless, that person can quietly change the thickness and shape of the shield completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He understands. He understood everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne; Sefer is not an ordinary victim at all. She is a magician and a magician with a deep mind. The mind is so deep that it is creepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Leonard knows that he must now make a look at her identity. His remaining strength is no longer enough to add another magician as an enemy...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he has no more time to think about how he will count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because another opponent found him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hearn? Who did he kill? Is it you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-elf Starting to talk, is a man wearing a flowing red shirt. He stood at the pedal of the bow, his eyes were covered with bloodshot eyes, and he was staring at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this man’s hand, holding a long sword... No, it should be said that it is a recurve sword, the sword of the "long sword" It is curved - it may be a foreign or heterogeneous weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the moment I saw this person, the sixth sense of the half-elf was madly reminding him: This would be a very dangerous enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I killed it." The half-elf nodded prudently, and the right-handed sword was tighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With a sword... No, two swords?" The man looked at the body on the ground and continued to ask questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two swords." The half-elf replied, step by step to the direction of the bow. At this moment, the pirates and sea soldiers around who are killing seem to have disappeared from his vision. "I hope that you can be a little stronger than him." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the pace of the pirate leader slowly moved forward with the rhythm of the language: "Great. I It is Kazmi, Kazmi; Stewarhaus, the leader of this privately-owned fleet. The half-elf with a fine sword... 'Throat'?'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes. In the Juzhou Islands, I still have a little reputation. I hope that you can be my next victory." Leonard tried to make a very arrogant look, want to shock the enemy in front of him, in order to obtain Advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The big pirate in the eighth place in the Far Sea, this battle, I am afraid you can't swallow it." But his opponent still looks calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance between the two weapons can reach each other, and the two stop at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kezmi lifted the sword obliquely, holding the tail of the hilt in his left hand, and the sword shrouded the captain of the sea corps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this distance, Leonard can already see the amazing length of the blood tank on the sword. Once hit, I am afraid that bleeding will reach the lethal amount within half a minute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf has a step back in the left leg, and the knees are slightly curved, which is beneficial to the maneuvering pace, facing the opponent's pressing. His wrists were miniature, and the tip of the sword shook slightly, and his heart quickly analyzed the opponent's posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party’s weapon looks like “斩” and “cut” as the main attack method, and is completely different from the “stab” of the fine sword. The swords in both hands are not the usage of ordinary swords, but rather the posture of heavy weapons like axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
