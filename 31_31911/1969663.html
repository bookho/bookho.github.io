The Fnvborderguard is a new warship. It is the new ride of the inland river commander, Leonard Kikawi. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the shelling adventure at Port Fort, he lost a boat and received a new ship and a naval lieutenant flag as compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander of the inland river fleet must have "excellent performance" before the hang of the lieutenant flag. The original position was established for a brigadier. The other flagship of each fleet has an admiral flag on its flagship, and each sub-fleet also has a lieutenant flag. As for the sea fleet of the prestige, each has a naval marshal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows this, but there is no dissatisfaction: the status of the fleet is commensurate with its strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last patron saint of the free country, the largest ocean force in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 575 ships, including 92 ships and first-class battleships. The total number of reserve forces including the armed merchant fleet is 2,180, and the total number of magic projection devices and various types of artillery is 17,924. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fleet is divided into seven sea fleets, each of which has a number of sub-fleet and regional fleets. The regional fleet will have at least four first-class battleships, and the sub-fleet will generally have several ordinary battleships, and only the flagship of the entire inland river fleet can be called a "flagship." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fleet is called Red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the largest maritime warfare ever. The number of ships is three times the sum of the fleet of the remaining four republics, and is only four points less than the sum of the elves off the coast, the far sea, the Coleman Royal Fleet and the Chinese Navy, which is the sum of all other civilized navies. one. This fleet was called by the posters of the later generations as "the king of the seas, the scepter of the world ruler, the symbol of trade and geography, the transmitter of all gold and silver", "the eternal crimson fleet." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Leonard has long been used to it. His patrol route meets with the six fleets of the Red Fleet on the outskirts of Kengal every day, and each fleet is much stronger than him. The regional fleets and sub-fleets of the Red Fleet are responsible for intercepting the mission of the Imperial Rapid Fleet, and his inland fleet can only be responsible for the smuggling of the Empire and the Sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, today’s Interlake Bay seems to be somewhat unusual. He waited for ten minutes in this sea area with the light north wind, and still did not wait for the seventh division. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he also guessed the reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard’s hand is holding a command book that has been soaked by his sweat. The elf does not have sweat when it is nervous, but the half elf will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Embassy of China in Honglinas has put forward the most solemn protest against the Senate Senate and has begun to destroy important documents. More than 200 elf ships are just Assembly near Intre. We believe that the declaration of war can happen at any time, please ask the Free Navy all ships to enter the highest alert state."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is written on the order. His captain, the captain of the captain, stood nervously with the logbook and waited for the meeting with the friendly fleet. The half-elf took out the pocket watch, looked at it, and closed it gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, you brought a patrol chart. If - I mean if - the enemy intends to break our sub-fleet here one by one, most likely Where will the location be chosen? Assume that the private ships on the previous days are scout ships and they know our patrol road map."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain’s gaze Six patrol routes were crossed and finally docked at a point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the wind started an hour ago, approaching the second regional fleet from the east side, then splitting the third division fleet, followed by the seventh and eighth Divide the fleet. This will destroy the four fleets, which is 60% of the combat power in the west of Interlake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then start with the strongest fifth division fleet...but they won't have so many ships."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf shook his head, "No, They will. They are Saint-Sen, I know them. Near the Intres, you can call one-half of the main ship of the Sassen Navy at any time - this fleet was originally used to destroy the assembly of the Red Fleet. Go to the battlefield where the fifth division may face the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy captain respected a sailor-style military ceremony: "Follow, Lieutenant General." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upper 尉 命令 命令 , , , , , , , , 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉 尉<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sails of red, white, gray, brown, and black are lined up in a distant sea, two -- perhaps three -- ―The queues are mixed together and entangled with each other. Some ships are sinking and their partners are bypassing these ships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, you said that there are half of the main ships of Sansen? But here is enough..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Leonard patted the shoulder of his deputy. "In my memory, the last time I saw so many ships gathered together was something that happened decades ago. There are iron cross flags, their purpose is the West Intl Sea Fleet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted the telescope and saw the same signal flag tied to the masts of the Elf ships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This morning... my country... has declared... your country... declare war..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard You can read the slogan of the elf naval pride without using translation at all. The slogan of the Old Elf Empire Navy has been used for more than two thousand years. These flags have flown from Lu Xinhai to the New World, and tens of thousands of ships have been sunk in front of these signal flags. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He calculated the number of remaining ships in the Red Fleet. A number that does not have an advantage, and the entire fleet has been cut by the opponent into two separate parts from the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the opposite fleet, the half-elves recognized many familiar flags and family emblems. The entire Sansen local fleet is here, and the ships of the distant sea fleet that can be called are basically in line. The number of ships is not many, but the quality is far better than the free navy that is temporarily patched together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the cannon roared in the distance, you can see the flash of magic flashing between the sea and the sky. His sailors have begun to change sails, the baffles on the artillery portholes are unloaded one by one, and the screamer shouts loudly...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Purgatory floats At sea. We are the last fleet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf murmured and raised his right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Emergency right full rudder! The whole fleet moves along the wind and avoids the enemy's shelling!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chief officer, the sailor and the deputy captain were all staring at their sir in surprise, and no one was going to execute the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right full rudder! Get out of the battlefield! How many times do you want me to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People panic Get up, get busy. The four-horned sail that had just been unloaded was reloaded, the ignited fire rope was annihilated, and two guns were fired. The inland river fleet dexterously turned an arc over the sea, avoiding the center of the battlefield: there, the two fleets were still madly, at no cost, as the wounded beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, the cannon could not be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have to cross Fort Vatican again and return to the capital."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes , sir. But before that, I still have something to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His deputy captain muttered to himself, seemingly struggling. A streamer hit the ship's side and the hull jerked; he took the opportunity to take away the half-elf's sword and threw the sword to the sailor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard was not surprised, he turned his boat slowly and turned around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy captain shook his head: "No, Lieutenant General, your behavior is rational. Someone must go back and report this to Lenny, and we must have a fleet to defend the capital. Personally, we also keep it. The life..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this does not affect you to accuse me, right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Have you read Article 10 of the Free Naval Regulations, Lieutenant General?" The Deputy Captain put away the logbook. "I believe you have read it. Every captain and captain have read it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard was dumb, but slowly recited the clause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In any case, the captain who does not choose the upper gust to enter the battle or deliberately evades the enemy will be prosecuted. In any case, regardless of the captain's body For the Brigadier General, Lieutenant General, Admiral or Marshal. It is an unreasonable rule, but it can guarantee that the Red Fleet will never fall apart like the Elven Navy a hundred years ago in the land of the sea."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s your responsibility to save the strength and report back, and arresting you is the responsibility of Captain Captain. This is the code of action for the Red Fleet." The Mariner added, "I will You testify, sir, but the rules are the rules."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Three days later, Leonard Kakawi ended his not-so-defensive position for the inland river fleet and returned to safe Lenny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least it’s safe at the moment." He said to the new commander of the fleet, "As for the next step, it’s up to you. I wish you a good trip. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May+82, June 26, 1666, Northwestern Borders<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp For the inhabitants of the southern town of Dagon in the Soma Principality, their lords changed overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver dragon representing the emperor and the colored dragon group representing the elf family landed, took off, landed again, and took off again. The flag of the entire region has finally changed color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the condition of the sovereignty of the Dragonian region of the "Dragon territory" of the Soma Principality, the people of Sansen reached a covenant with the Emperor. According to this covenant, after the reunification of the empire in the south, the main settlements of the two half-elfs in the southwestern part of the empire and the northwest of the Freedom State will be assigned to Sansen, plus the new Tsemman’s thirteen states and the empire in the new Almost all the colonial territories of the Intercontinental Island and the Murray Empire are added. The emperor left himself with only a few small islands on the global fairway and the territory of the Far East. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conditions that are so generous have even convinced the family that is most hostile to humans in Sanctuary. After all, only the "semi-elf territory" is a piece of land equivalent to half the size of the local sanctuary. In order to win their land, the Elf nobles united for the first time. They claimed that it was the greatest elf force after the collapse of the Elves, and even the Elves' efforts to recover the East in the Dark Ages could not be compared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point they point to is the pioneer city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pioneer city was once known as Floras, a city of elves, half-elves and humans. In the history of more than a thousand years, it has played many different roles: the provincial capital of the Elven Empire, the Governor of Koman, the Archbishop of the Orthodox Church, the Imperial Autonomous City, the Free Trade Republic, and the Mandiel Family. The Territory, the Pioneer State Government, the Northern Temporary Governorate Resident.........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and its latest identity is the Western Army’s Northwest Battle Group Command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Admiral, the number of votes of the staff is half to half. Half of the staff believe that the mains of the elves will go south at any time, with as many as ours. The army of the army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the report of Lieutenant Colonel Robert Ayre, Clade Lopez’s fingers slid on the military map. He did not believe that such feuds would be so easily resolved: but this did not affect his seriousness of possible threats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The other half naturally does not believe that the elf will really launch an offensive? This may be just a plot by the emperor to try to smash the West to disperse our troops?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" There are many signs that there are at least 20,000 blood elves and half-elves across from us. During the time you went to the South Line, border friction increased. There are reports that the Sansen Army was found eighty kilometers north." Robert threw a stack of reports on the table. "In the past two months, I organized a defense network with a depth of 200 kilometers, all medium. The above units of magical power are used as counter-attack reserve teams, and the troops that are too far ahead are rotated and retracted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but that is the Navy's general assembly order, sir." The lieutenant colonel nodded. "The Battle of Tielburg is over. Our army sank twenty-three, captured 51 ships, and the rest was defeated into four. The fleet is divided."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finger of the generals taps the table gently: "In the name of the Provincial Joint Council and the Free Naval Command, The fleet: the East Intres Regional Fleet, the Northern Regional Fleet, the Sansen Regional Fleet, the Eastern Regional Fleet, the Xinzhou Regional Fleet, and the Inter-Sea Regional Fleet gathered at the fastest speed in the East Intres, and then battled with the enemy. All the ships of the free country have the obligation to defend the motherland and turn the tide. In this case, I hope that the kings will work hard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert has no calm tone from his chief Hear the tendency. He hesitated and decided to take neutrality: "Work hard... it doesn't sound like any strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This proves that the elves are serious, they have invested a lot of money. What is the situation of the gun car?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The basics of staying in the northern front are fixed and concentrated here. According to the plan, we will advance in the enemy's main force. When you reach within 50 kilometers, you will fight back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klad stood up and said: "You said that the enemy has been found within 80 kilometers. When? Things?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yesterday. Therefore, now our counterattacks have entered combat readiness...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Admiral walked quickly to the hanger and grabbed the cloak of the admiral's dress on his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Robert, go back to the troops station! If I didn't guess wrong, the other party is testing our actions-"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they walked out of the gate, they happened to hear a loud explosion from afar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stop. Admiral Lopez looked up and saw the shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw flying creatures with giant wings and streamlined tails cast shadows on the river and on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the dragons are the colors of the forest. The wingspan of the emerald color, the claws of the emerald color, the dragon flame of the emerald color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw these huge figures passing over the front line, straight over the city of Gustav, and hovering over the front line headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are casting black water, using small dive and dragon flames to annihilate the magicians on the ground who are trying to block. In response to the weak top armor of the Klad, they cast sharp needle-shaped spears. These sharp Mithril sticks pierced the roof, and the spells engraved on them turned into poison clouds, which were also deadly smoke like forests. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Imperial Dragon Knights of the Soma Principality? No. Impossible. The dragon of the empire is not emerald. These dragons are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crad Lopez read the name that should not appear here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautifully inscribed inscriptions are engraved on the dragon knight's coat of arms, encircling the outside of the Legion logo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The text of the inner circle is "on behalf of the people of San Sen and the Senate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Text of the outer circle It is "a legion can be destroyed, but it will never be defeated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central digital sign is a circular "zero." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sanctuary Zero Corps, also known as the Airborne Legion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the elves got the number of "zero" from Oriental mathematics, they used it as the legendary legion of the number. Since the collapse of the power of the ancient elf empire in the fourth century, Sansen’s only new legion. In the ensuing history, it will become a strong soldier who will be frustrated by all enemies. The Sanctuary Civil Air Force (hcaf) has been fighting until the last moment of the entire Elf race. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really is a big capital, Hong Linnas is serious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"They never planned to start a war of attrition with us on the front line. From the beginning they were targeting the most intriguing and most threatening Clade guns... it was a wonderful opening."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upward raised his right hand and called out his flying sword. But none of the dragons stopped, they passed over the city of Pioneer and did not linger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lieutenant Ayr!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert heard the call of the sergeant, leaving those who are The magician who blows away the poison cloud rushes back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he was shocked by the eccentric dress of the chief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crad Lopez wore an Eastern-style robes on his top general, with his arms pointing straight toward the north. Robert saw a strangely shaped oriental fan caught in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Admiral?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This attire can help me think." Clad seems I didn’t feel that my dress was weird. He touched his chin and had a strange smile on his face. "Cancel the counterattack plan. Inform the frontline troops of the reserve team and let them start to withdraw."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert feels some difficulty breathing: "But this...you Did you give up the defensive counterattack plan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the dragon's flying range, there is no defensive counterattack plan. Perhaps this order is too late for some troops, we are standing On the cliff of total collapse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only adversity, only It’s worth our effort, Robert.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical power of the Freedom Army is so stretched in front of the Airborne Legion that specializes in combating the other’s command system, several front lines The command post was lost one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two brigades north of the Pioneer City were in a state of chaos, and one company after another has begun to retreat. In the emperor holding a spear and a musket, the elf is armed with a large sword and a long bow. These people are chasing the retreating Free Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under their thin figure, it is the muscle strength that humans can't match, even the most famous human duelists can only shun in front of the elves. You know, there is never a human being able to pull the longest elf longbow, neither. An elf archer can shoot twelve arrows with this heaviest bow, and all troops without heavy self-defense will suffer heavy losses in front of this shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;San Sen Army fulfilled their alliance treaty with the Empire and invaded the South. This is the first time that the elf's armed forces have officially entered the land under human control since the complete victory of the second dynasty of Koman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May+83, Fort Worth, June 23, 1666<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the day the blockade was broken, the honorable emperor personally stood on the dock of Fort Foti, waiting for the arrival of the Elf Allies and the Imperial Transport Fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Munich? Weilun von? The Princess of Fegota stood behind him, quietly looking at the sails in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the ship's mast, dragged a long white cloth. On the white cloth, the same line of text was written in Elvish and Coman, and it was reflected in her pupil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our handshake may not span 1300 years, but it can cross the mountains and the sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;黛妮卡 repeated this sentence softly. She watched the fleet slide into the port. At the time of the salute that was greeted, the entire camp was filled with cheers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limited supply has been going on for a while. From five days ago, even the magical bread was mixed with wood chips, and the taste was like the soap, mildew cheese and raw butter mixed and fermented. Indeed, the troops did not change, but malnutrition and hunger have killed one-tenth of the people and one-half of the horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf aristocrat who led the escort fleet jumped onto the dock and showed his respect in a cold voice with alms. Instead of using the title of "Imperial Emperor", he used the title of "The Lord of the Eastern Territory" in the Age of the Elves. The old Duke of Figueta, standing next to Jenica, immediately sank, but did not attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor cleared his throat and raised his scepter: "I thank you for your hard work in the name of all the people of Koman."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes stay on the transport ship in the port. Except for the Elf frigates, the number of remaining ships seems to be less than planned. His brow wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf nobles noticed the emperor’s dissatisfaction and explained in the same indifferent tone: “I’m sorry, we can only raise six ships this time. The elves can be nearby. There aren't many ports in control, and they don't have the ability to provide enough supplies for your fleet. Your other ships are raising more supplies for your next move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty..." The commander of the Imperial Transport Fleet is going to stop. It was the count of a small family whose family had been sailing in the land of the sea since hundreds of years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gustav patted his shoulder and prevented him from continuing: "Go to the Prime Minister to arrange supplies, Earl. Eagle Wing, you go to reception Our guests. The rest of the cabinet, we went to the headquarters to discuss the next steps after the replenishment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial nobles are in order Dispersed, each to perform their own tasks, only Seneca stayed in place, I do not know how to be good. She is not accustomed to her identity, and there is no precedent to follow: there was no such role in the court before. She doesn't know where she should go. Most of the ladies, including Olia, went to the banquet with the foreign minister, the Eagle Wing, and her adoptive father was following the emperor to the headquarters. Yanika stuck her eyes on the security minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid? Nath as if she sensed her gaze, turned her head and smiled at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of Security’s pupil seems to be flashing green, and the smile looks as gentle as a woman. Monica was a little confused and didn't know what kind of information it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please wait..." She habitually made a noise, but suddenly felt wrong. Those who are all high-ranking aristocrats -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Duke of Figota turned around and walked quickly to her side, slamming her back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, daughter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid’s gentle smile disappeared under his indifference mask. At that time, Monica suddenly understood the position she was set in this court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ran up and caught up with the team that represented the highest power of the empire. The team quietly gathered in the center of Fort Vatican to discuss a number of matters concerning the Elf Covenant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The public, the elf will not give us more supplies." Gustav's voice is low, only a few people can hear his tone Dissatisfaction, "Of course, this result is expected, but I hope that you can come up with countermeasures."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elf fulfilled the covenant, but It doesn't mean they are happy to see that we have achieved complete victory. As long as the transportation line is still in their hands, we will never have enough supplies to launch the attack.” The cold voice of the Security Minister echoed, narrating the reasonable facts, “The same Their fleet will never cooperate with us to capture Lenny, we must use our own power to attack Lennie. For the sharp ears, we are defeated here, they can safely manage the newly acquired land." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we have been preparing for so many years. So many years! We paid so much to get here. Get here!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gustav’s scepter squats on the table, Zhang Gang wooden table crumbled into powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Renee felt that his figure was a bit sad. She has seen the real psychology of the great emperor too many times, knowing that he is not as cold-blooded and decisive as the superficial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Duke of Figota rudely interrupted: "On your own? It is impossible to launch a large-scale attack by relying on the supply of several ships per week. Or, do you think the opponent will rush to let us kill?" It must be reminded that the defensive war will not have a decisive victory, because we have no chance to pursue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 yawned. Her attention crossed the argument, her eyes crossed the crowd, and she stayed on the huge military map on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron grey and blue circles and arrows look beautiful and full of opportunities. The three Freedom Forces, from the north, the south, and the east, were closed like iron tongs, trapping the empire's army in a small area near Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fergutta Army in the northeast lacks strength, and the Emperor’s main force lacks supplies. All the problems are just a mountain range and no more than 40,000 enemy troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If all we need is the difference...the solution is obvious. It’s obvious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 speaks to himself, and the gaze of his eyes suddenly meets again with the eyes of the security minister. He seems to be watching her with a gentle look after the speech. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soul connection is established."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfamiliar female voice suddenly rang in her ear. This sound sounds soft, with the magic that can seduce all men, but there is a hidden fortitude. Jenny immediately understood that this was a spiritual communication of a senior mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Maggie? Veri. I am your friend, hehe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The female voice was suddenly interrupted. At the same time as the sound was interrupted, Sid’s gaze was out of contact with Jenny’s gaze, and he was presenting to the emperor a strategy to guard against the elves’ “allies”. Yanika turned her eyes cautiously and let her eyes align with Sid: at the moment of gaze docking, the female voice resumed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My time is very small. You have to understand the situation through the soul connection, hehe. You have the talent of spiritual magic, please meditate 'I want to know', close Eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 will close his eyes with doubt. For a moment, she seemed to see an optical link built up in the etheric ocean, connected from a position behind Sheed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast amount of information rushed into the girl’s mind, and she suddenly knew what Maggie had wanted to let her know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A story about the ambition of a female magician. She abandons all morality and uses the story of all the chips. The story of death and soul. The "clock" used to control the soul and the story of its destruction. After the absolute control of the clock was destroyed, she was able to find the story of survival in the tough spirit of Sid Nasser. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, how she found a way to instantly establish a soul connection and share power. It's just an easy way, but it's very effective. Finally, the story ends in this hall, where the female wizard of the tragedy finally meets the opportunity she wants - perhaps the last chance. At the end of this massive amount of information, Maggie made an agreement to share the talent and strength of the nickname, in order to liberate her one day. Your own soul. She doesn't expect to get much help, just hope to leave a copy of the soul here in the case of Jenny, just in case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything happens in the blink of an eye. Yanika immediately instinctively felt the risk: the whole story seemed to be too legendary, and there were too many coincidences. From the common sense, these ten ** are a conspiracy of the security minister... or the conspiracy of this woman who calls herself "Maggie yavi". Maybe she will lose her life, or worse, lose her soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 opened his eyes, his mouth slightly upturned, and turned into an inconspicuous smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of risk, but she has seen that kind of architectural soul The method of connection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost as she saw the optical link, she came up with a great idea: connect all powerful minds in this way The idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If this idea is realized... is it better to call it the 'magic net'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finally understood that she should use all her efforts to do something. She finally understood why she had subconsciously chose this side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unified great empire. Eternal peace, countless knowledge and a new magic net. An exciting new world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡默默 stood up and walked in front of the military map in full view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that my proposal is a bit reckless. Have you ever thought about what would happen to our Fegota public over the Ridge Mountains? This should be enough Make up the difference in shipping."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice sounds light but full of power. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since A thousand years ago, Arthur Coleman forced the army to cross the Ridge Mountains during the Dandelion War, and the most daring and risky plan since defeating the Far East Army It happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Occasionally there will be postscripts of the authors)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone, clear and happy (um... new legal The blessings of the holiday sounds really cold). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to apologize for the recent slow update. The speed of the monthly magazine has also been broken. I am really embarrassed: mainly because I am too busy recently to be gamified in the world of Aicania. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you are not mistaken. If you have noticed my blog [the flagship of the strategic aviation marshal's flagship] (search for the address), perhaps I know that my job is a game designer (narrator: it is dead planning). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the background world of gbrn and bis is going to be an online game, and the author is the project director and chief designer. If all goes well, this game will appear in front of everyone in a year or two. I am not convenient to disclose the company and the investor, and it is still in the confidentiality period :). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the original design intent, only the game is the true expression of the world of Akania. From the very beginning, the world was set up for gamification. This is not a secret, but I did not expect that there will be a real day of realization. The name of Acania ar is from the mystery ar, the environment of gbrn is reference to gta, bis is of course paying tribute to Black Island blackisle, and the magic name is directly copied from d&d. The length of the entire background setting actually runs through two thousand years. There are 1500 years before bis, and 300 years after gbrn. The story of the heroes and heroes will not only go back two hundred years from the gbrn era, but will also advance for three hundred years until the end of the 22nd century and the reconstruction of the standard (I will not say which game to pay tribute to). Similarly, geographically, Ascania also has an oriental part and a full set of Oriental history/magic settings (see a rumor), but it has always appeared only in the background story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These settings are finally available, in the game. The story of the game will take place in the standard calendar 2161 (this year ... cough), 300 years after gbrn, 500 years after bis. The specific plot will spoil through the development of bis, so I can't say for the time being... The setting that can be said is that the extremely expanding Escania people have finally exhausted fossil fuel resources and ushered in their systolic period. In this era, the magical inheritors of Ascania have a great magic school responsible for inheriting the knowledge of the old days. They have a huge orbital aura that is responsible for providing energy to the world. They have a Cyberbo-style virtualized magic network and also have A large group of troubles inherited from the glorious past and the different worlds. (Remarks tribute list: Leibovitz's hymns, Harry Potter, halo, system turbulence, coc, warhammer, and others.) In short, it is also in the world of Aikania whose belief determines power and magic belongs to science. Inside. In addition, there will probably be the role-playing rules and card games of the legendary Akanania world. If there is a surplus in the budget, there will be a hammer-like desktop game...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a game designer, this may be the biggest dream. Just like Richard Garriott, Sid Meier, Sakaguchi, and Matsuno Taiji, they have turned their dream world into reality. According to international practice, this project full of director's waywardness and obsession will put the name of the dead director in front of the project... like "sidmeier'scivils", this project may be called "necroman'sworldofarlin-< ="" ="">-Name is the magic of the world online... All of these are spoofs, please don't take it seriously.) Anyway, in the domestic game industry, this seems to be the first game supervised by the original author himself, a little small Small satisfaction.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
