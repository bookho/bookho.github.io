Jena Narrows in the West Bank of the Kings<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in Figota Half a month after the army crossed the mountains, the iron empire flag was once again inserted in the hills to the east of the Wangren River and west of the Deer River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half of the area was voluntarily given by the Free Army, and the other half was captured. Except for a small number of areas where militia forces are still guerrilla, the main force of the Free Army has mostly withdrawn from the King River. All the mobile forces that the Western Army can mobilize, from the Lopez Department, the Luther Department to the Fox's General Reserve, are all deployed in the West Bank basin, guarding all enemy forces approaching from the North and the East. The dispatch of materials was completed as early as a month ago, and the entire West Bank became a rear base for a large counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half of the PLA’s division chiefs gathered in Jena’s narrow area to discuss countermeasures against the current difficulties. The Wings of Magic, the Empty Horse and the Wyvern of the Wyvern landed on the narrow training ground. The magicians near the anchor point nervously prevented the transmission of accidents. People with the ranks of Colonel, Brigadier General and Major General came and went in the headquarters. I don't know when the military camp seems to have lost its color. The color of military uniforms is increasing, but the expression on people's faces is getting less and less, and eventually they all merge into a serious iron gray, even if there is no vitality in the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jena Narrow should not be in this color."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsible for logistics The young lady was sitting on the towering tower and looking at the busy crowd underneath, gently shaking her high-heeled military boots. Her face was covered with a blush, and her fingers subconsciously tapped on the railing. Around the watchtower, engraved with complex magic lines, countless dense silver tubes point to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the temporary pier not far away, the flexible and small ferry was docked, and one big man jumped out of the boat and hurried to the venue. There are many reefs in the channel of the King River, and the water conditions are complicated. There are no large sailing boats and barges on the Metebexi River, only small petrol ferries. The rolling hills in the far east of the East Bank are not eye-catching from the lookout tower. Currently there are only one team and another team of investigators. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What color do you think should be, Miss Sefer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combat The new captain of the ministry stood in front of a huge keyboard and wiped the magic loop from the keyboard to the secret silver tubes. Very strangely, in the middle of the camp, this huge organ is placed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it’s not just the organ. In order to ensure the safety of the Jena camp, the Free Army built a new air defense system. At the core of the system is this new weapon, the organ-type magical guide gun named "Slayer Dragon Melody". Made by the great music sorcerer Handel, with 120 independent guns and a weight of 1.6 tons, the "Slayer's Melody" was originally ordered for the Lonnie City defensive war after the coup, now this one Weapons that cost three percent of the Free Army’s annual budget have also been moved to the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since seeing the power of the Emperor Silver Dragon, no one dared to underestimate the air force of the Empire. The elite magic forces mobilized from the Western Generals controlled the perimeter defense network. Almost all of the eunuch magicians were picked up by the war department and arranged for air defense operations on each lookout tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aunt Anne Sefer yawned and grabbed a dark glass bottle from the table next to him. The liquid in the glass bottle hits the wall and makes a slight squeak. She used the bottle to face the sun, narrowing her eyes to distinguish the color of the inside of the syrup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it is grape purple. Jena narrow, green belt embedded in the rough and barren plains of the city, along the west bank of the king's river Fertile farmland. In the Age of Empires, it was the corridor leading to the south. It was later known as the grape and wine estate, one of the five best wine producing regions in the world. The new sorghum planted for only two years exudes the aroma of charcoal. The same thousand and six hundred years of Gutian soil taste mixed together in the air, the sun-like taste stays in the evening wind. Before the parasites of the New World appeared, this is the perfect wine field..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie's fingers are gently pressed at the slender bottle mouth, the magic flows into the bottle, and the cork is flushed out like champagne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said it is wrong, this is not wine." Annie sniffed the mouth of the bottle. "This is the 1648's 'Jena's Marquis Manor', which is dyc1648. It is too rude to call it wine! This is The world's most promising wine is better than all the wines that Faus has brewed in the country for 20 years. Until the 18th century, there will be no wines that can be compared with him! It is sleeping, not knowing how much potential it has. It will take another hundred years, no, two hundred years to exude. If he can meet him in the peak state, I have no regrets in this life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Really? Let me give it a try."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door grabs the bottle of red wine and is skilled in the skills he used to work in a hotel. I changed it to a ventilated bottle. In Anne's alchemy flask, the 18-year-old wine fragrance began to bloom. Rosemary, cinnamon and cloves... No, the aroma of the flowers echoed in the rust-colored tower, and in a moment they both thought they were in the flower field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This great wine, usually the metaphor should be a beautiful girl? But even a beautiful girl can also use her careful care to let her show up early The charm of the monk. My technique is not good enough, I can't let it reach the peak, but it should be enough for people to enjoy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will The breathable bottle was handed to Anne. The female niece stared at the ventilated bottle and suddenly covered her mouth, making it difficult to laugh at herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong, Anne? What's wrong with this bottle change... is it dissatisfied?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Annie turned her head and wiped her eyes quietly, transforming the subject hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course there is dissatisfaction! I am a logistics staff, why are you being posted by this guy? Three hours a day! Let me stay here, It’s better to let our guest organist Miss Metty Crosso come to control the dragon melody! Is this the biggest selling point of this thing, isn’t it possible to play the famous organ song 'The Gods Blessing' when it is fully launched? I heard that for this boring function, the overall cost has increased by 20%."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You always have to allow these guys who are called great magicians. Some are willful? After all, only he can make it alone. As for your dissatisfaction..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nelally pulled a stool and sat down: "First The logistics department now has 17 people. It is not difficult to draw three hours a day to discharge the posts. Second, according to the testimony of witnesses on other defensive towers, they often see the time at the time of your post. There is only one magical uniform in the military uniform and the workmanship is walking around. Third, some people complain that the red wine distribution center is under the central defense tower is a decision to use power for personal gain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain leisurely picked up the glass and lifted it to his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last and most important thing is, I don’t know who else has the reliability to fight like you. In addition, you really haven’t slept for a long time. Have you ever wondered? Although you are bored here, you can take a good rest. Let us cheer for the good year of the legend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to him, Anne's face changed continuously several times. She also raised her glass and whispered a gentle but fierce counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Awful, you didn't have such a slick before. Well, the final statement of the morning dew plan really makes you so nervous? You need to escape here. Rest?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it’s the turn of the door. He shook the glass in his hand and let the silky liquid shake in front of his eyes: "After all, it is 'morning dew'. In fact, even myself, I doubt the feasibility of this plan. This plan is free country. The final plan is so cruel. I don't know if I can finish the plan... I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we need your freedom Hero. Actually, everyone in the plan knows, isn't it? You only need to state it once."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be said that it includes the generals of the empire. Everyone knows. If we pay such a big price, we still can't..." His words choked. "Can't... can't... What are the meanings of those sacrifices?!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne silently filled his glass and the captain sipped the glass of wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gloomy voice popped from Anne's throat. Her voice is not as sunny as usual, not so crisp, but full of mysterious pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At this moment, you can't escape to your hometown to pick up a girl." She held the guardrail and staggered and stood up. "You can tell me to fight." The goal set by the staff, Captain Soledon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First, to ensure that our army acts in accordance with our plan. Second, forcing the enemy to follow us. Planned action. Third, formulate a plan that can achieve the above two goals, and end." I don't know why, Nana has not hesitated to bounce off the chair and repeat the regulations to his subordinates. "This problem is still difficult." Pour me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, why do you think the premise of the morning dew plan is not credible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The problem is Lenny. The whole morning dew's plan is to use Lenni as a bait to break the enemy's supply line one by one, but... if it is my plan to make the emperor, I will never let even one soldier A trip to Lenny! In this case, we will face more than 120,000 enemy troops in this Jena Narrow "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; 1648 years of aroma floating in the air, along with the girl giggles, laughter sounds a little tipsy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just this problem. Think about it! You should know how many Freedom fighters are currently in the Jena Narrows on the West Bank. ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question is too simple. The flags of the nine divisions are flying, and these nine divisions represent 85,000 soldiers. However, this fact Anne should be clearer than him...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many people have we lost in the past six months?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nelity remembers that before this all began, each full freelancer should have 12,000 soldiers. However, in fact, they have almost lost four to five whole divisions, plus daily consumption and combat reduction, a total of more than 80,000 republic citizens have already given their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are about 80,000 people. The battle between the emperor and the rebels is very heroic. It is because the loss is already so great that the emperor can directly Through the entire army of Lenny, we attacked the main force of our serious damage..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie poured another glass of wine: "You reverse this thing, I know the reason why the emperor must attack Lenny. From the perspective of the empire, the reason is really obvious, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reversely "The expression on the face of the door suddenly solidified, and the glass in the hand fell to the ground." "Is this the case? I am still too immature. Thank you, Annie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't say anything," Anne's face was revealed. Pleasant smile, diligently took out another goblet and filled it with wine. "By the way, about the duty..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upper Did not hesitate to refuse. "If you have other things, I can help you on behalf of the class. However, if you remove you from the list of values... Sorry, this position must have strength and insight. After all, the whole army is the most secure. Important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey." Annie said, "So, how about helping me for a long time?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long-term not. Once in two times, it should be OK, of course, when you have a mission, I will be all-inclusive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;empty wine glasses Colliding with the table and making a crisp sound seems to reflect the serious expression of its owner. "Twice in three times, plus a bottle of dyc1648. Not expensive, you can buy real goods in a thousand gold pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number can be a good little shop in the outside of Lenny. "A thousand pounds... You just sold me. I don't know how many rewards a captain can have on the empire? Or, will I give you back when I am out?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing this sentence, the female lieutenant supported the table, bounced off the chair and took a piece of paper on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just glanced at the complicated magic lines around the piece of paper, and there was already a cold sweat behind the door. He can recognize that this is a magic contract that “when the contract is breached, there will be a summoning creature to ensure the execution of the contract”, but it is impossible to identify what creature is called. From the point of view of the complexity of the spell, it is at least a summoned beast above the medium-level creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magical summons contract? I said, there is no need to use this thing? You sell this thing, you can buy at least three bottles, no, five Bottle of a thousand pounds of wine!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne shrugged: "So, of course, it is interest. Naimen? Mr. Soledon is willing to take life as Make sure to deliver ten bottles of the 1648-year-old Jena Earl's Manor in the first place after the head of the crowd... Just write, how?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Ten... ten bottles..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth sense of resistance to the door tells him that I am afraid that I will not be able to sign this "sale contract" today. watchtower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and pulled out his pen, put on magic ink, wrote the evidence and signature on the loan according to what Anne said, and dropped it. One drop refers to blood. After all the ceremonies were completed, and by the light of the rainbow, Anne satisfactorily collected the loan. The young officer sighed and stared at the future 10,000 pounds disappearing into the unfathomable women's bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are a soldier, at least you have to mix it with the generals to get it? As a pointing fee, it seems to be a bit expensive...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his belly, the sound of the organ came from afar in the north. Sixteen salute bombs flew up into the sky, and they opened four stars of four colors each. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The general salute. The boat of Klad Lopez is docked, I am going to go to the meeting."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne shakes the ventilated bottle in his hand: "I haven’t finished this post. When making a report, be sure to state the merits of our department. It is not a good idea to raise a lot of grain from West Rorlock. "Simple things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure. The so-called strategy is to induce the opponent to follow our intentions. If they do not act according to our intentions, then The battle forced them to follow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later that day, the final step of the morning dew battle plan was confirmed by Conti, the following Marshal Fox. The days of the deferred battle of the Figota public have finally arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same day<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jena Narrowland 45 km southeast? Emperor ** temporary camp <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military tents are covered with mountains and plains, filling the gap between the road and the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fgueta’s “Purple Baboon” and the Imperial Royal’s “Iron Cross” flew over the huge camp and declared the owner of the camp. Identity. This unit is the spoiler of the Western War, crossing the Fergutta Army in the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire has been mobilized for more than four months, and the morale of this unit when it was first released has long been exhausted and looked languid. The soldiers carry heavy objects, grab the magical armored spears, and do the simplest and most basic assassination training. This is not difficult for the average soldier, but it is very laborious for the soldiers here - because most of these people are teenagers and women. A few adult men who are mixed in are practicing, but their attitude is not serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, the eunuch over there, your troops are serious, all the stabs must not hesitate! The neat stab in the battle decides Winning and losing! I know that your march is good, but fighting is another matter! The so-called battle is discipline and courage!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lines are very serious The training, but I do not know why, with the voice of the girl shouted out to listen to it, there is no deterrent. After shouting a few words, it seems that she herself found that the effect was not good, so she had to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It took only three days to take over, I can only do my best. I still think that we should not act according to the enemy's intentions. Unfortunately, no one listens to me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the commander of this unit, the princess of the brown hair is full of dissatisfaction. The first princess, Olia Hugh Coleman, who was walking with her, heard the soft complaint and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, but,... everyone should be able to see that this is a strategy to lure the enemy! After leaving enough troops to attack the Lenny, the main force of the southern line is only 50,000 people can go north! This 50,000 people plus The 35,000 people of our Figota army, and the enemy forces are just the same!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Princess Olia licked her head, Raised his finger: "I don't remember the detailed distribution of forces, but shouldn't our army have 160,000 people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Elf Army is very There is combat power, but self-protection first, offensive operations can not be expected, Klad's bastard used this to eat half of our reserve army. This will reduce 50,000 people. Then left 30,000 siege troops in Lennie, Then the rest is not the 85,000 people? The 65,000 people who beat the bastard with 85,000 people... The victory and defeat is only between five and five."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is not very dangerous?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just said these facts, they took me The general staff came out and let me come back to lead my army! This is exile!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 with a corner of his eyes and a side of his own army". It is said that there are three elite knights of 500, but... she lowered her voice and repeated herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Own army. Hey. These guys can also count the army, the whole world has long been unified. Olia, you said, these stinking nobles What kind of dirty things are in my head? It is obviously the blood of the old Duke of Loren..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! This is not a topic that can be discussed openly. I also hate the nobility, but..." Olia patted her shoulder with a sympathetic expression. "Tough it. The guys heard that suddenly there was a bloodless sister, they were very excited." The ability of the three guys in the Figota family is first-class in the new generation, but it’s just a bit of a singularity. Although the boss only loves to watch the game, he is the third strong record holder in the history of medical knights. Improved the standard epee technique of the empire; the second is the Coman servant council member, but he also likes fortress construction and artillery; the third is a beautiful young boy, but he is also a member of the Royal Society of Science and the Institute of Magic Studies... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Look at the troops they sent. One hundred and fifty so-called gladiators who insist on using swords and shields, two hundred and fifty servants who claim to be able to operate cannons, and one hundred horses riding races. The beautiful young knight... give me fifty pikemen and one hundred gunmen, I can kill them all!" The whips in the hands of 黛妮卡, "they have a clear understanding of the 'use of the army' The deviation! This is the era of spears and muskets, steel and will! There are also a few letters written in 'Big Brother', all two are so stupid! Who cares how many years you have no sisters, or There are things like noble friends who want to reform politics and want to see the text garbage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, I can probably imagine Understand some of them, 黛妮卡.” Olia whispered, “Their nobles were born under the influence of magic for the war in the south. Because of the heavy casualties of male aristocrats in previous free wars, this Almost all nobles of a generation want to continue The pulse is preference for men... If it is not your identity, the love letters that are now being proposed may be piled up outside the military camp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a common sense to let Jenny The card lingered for a moment. After all the training teams, she realized what Olia said: "You mean... your imperial aristocracy uses magic to control gender? Then, isn't that a serious marriage problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah. However, according to the history of the past century, all the extra men will die in the war. Half of my aunt’s generation It is a widow; it is almost impossible for the viscounts and barons of this generation to find a spouse of equal status. The eldest son of the Duke can reach the daughter of the count, and it is already very good. Your three brothers should not be engaged." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to Olympia’s cruel but calm tone, I don’t know what to say. Under the glamorous appearance of the aristocratic system, there seems to be many unimaginable realities. Seeing her expression, Olia’s tone turned and tried to say some jokes: “Of course, it’s impossible to get engaged before the war. In those legends, if a man is engaged or his wife is pregnant, 100% will die. Recently no one has been engaged or married before the expedition, 'go back to my home', 'someone waiting for me' is a military ban. If someone really writes a love letter to Jenny, be sure to follow The scent swears at him, letting the guys who want to eat swan meat come back and look like this, which will reduce the risk of war death..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened the curtain of her staff's camp. Although there are only five hundred people under his command, Danica has set up a staff department that operates according to the system, from combat, command to logistics and communication. Of course, given the nature of the troops underneath, the staff were dressed like maids, some dressed like nobles, and some dressed like gladiators; in short, no one looked like a soldier, except one that was not Should belong to the people here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man in a red-rimmed uniform sits at the end of the long table and is incompatible with the surrounding environment, like a statue made of crystal. The air around him seems to have solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Royal Security Minister, Lord Hedner Nasser, why are you in my headquarters? I should be notified."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greetings of Seneca are like a gust of wind that broke through the stagnant air. I don't know why, she saw this person has an impulse to confront him - although privately, Richid gave her a lot of intelligence, but she never trusted the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, there is a task that cannot be pushed, and you are related to the princess." The man took the red cup with a sigh of relief. "We gave the next two days." Regarding your report, I was very worried after I saw it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yenica put Olia on the chair next to herself and sat directly on her own. At the other end of the long table, the legs that overlap each other have an aggressive posture, which makes them look higher than the other. "Beyond worrying about me, he should be more worried about the future of the Holy Empire? The military miracle that crossed the mountains was quickly ruined by his generals. I was really sad for the plan I designed."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty knows that you will be dissatisfied, he does not dare to explain, so I sent you to explain to you, Princess Fegota. Your Majesty wants to let you know, North It is different from the South. The decision he made was out of helplessness, not disregarding your opinion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The princess deliberately squeezed a sneer out of his throat . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I believe that the strategy should be the same in the South and the North. Regardless of the standard, it is a stupid act to split the troops to play Rennie. Will the enemy feel that we are helpless? The replenishment that we have worked hard in the Principality of Fygota is thrown into the black hole of Lenny? If the elf tears up our treaty, everything will be finished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least so far, the elves still respect the signed agreements, although they will leave a lot of back doors." The security minister's expression was slightly loose. Seneca was surprised to find that Sid was also blind. "We have eliminated at least 70,000 South Army in the past six months. However, these southern scorpions have pulled out 60,000 new troops during this time, and at least 50,000 people have trained in Lenny, Emerald and Interry. As long as we have not occupied Lenny, they can pull a new Lenny Army, a new Western Army and even a new Free Army from the city. In other words, let's play It’s not Lenny at all. What we want to destroy is the complementary system of the other party.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Supplement system?” 黛妮卡 coughed, “Being a Former citizens, I must say that the difference between the free army’s supplementary system is known to even three-year-olds. Have you seen Machiavelli’s book? The Free Army’s system of military service is the worst system, no one.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is impossible to know the true power of the free system at your age."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sid's gaze casts into the distance, seemingly looking at something that others can't see. Renee is convinced that he can see something that others can't see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I still remember the eight-year war, the first free war. The map of the South is drawn from the quagmire and the mire, each The city is hiding the air that is against us. The glorious summer will soon pass, the muddy autumn will go with hunger, and the harsh winter will always defeat us. The heads of the millennial famous family are rolling down the mire, and their crowns are cast. Dirty Golden Pound. If the nightmare is not to be repeated, we must get Lonnie before the end of this summer, at any cost. For the sake of your knees."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Although the Minister of Security kept screaming at the Emperor, but Nika did not feel a trace of respect from his demeanor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not so much that he is loyal, it is better to say that he is watching the development of the situation with a utilitarian view. The efficiency of his work is unparalleled, but he does not seem to care about the consequences of the work. The attitude of such a bystander...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the eyes of others, I am also a character that cannot be seen, understood, and lacks humanity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of warm hands seem to gently hug from behind Living in her, Maggie yavi's soft voice rang in the depths of her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you are not. A person who can communicate with others so much can't be such a person. If the man would destroy the world, you would Will revive the world. The man wants to block all information, and you want to spread all the information. You and him are different bystanders, completely different. He is surrounded by ambitious homes, and you are surrounded by gentle people." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand... I will understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior is lying on the table Next, it seems to have lost all power. The icy iron table is printed on your back and feels like a mortuary bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid stood up and looked down at her eyes from above. The safety minister’s pupil is dark black, deep bottomless, invisible, incomprehensible, and lacking in humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, in the next battle, your troops and my troops will be listed together as a general reserve team. I hope to use our two armies. At that time, we can cooperate happily for the ultimate victory. Of course, your troops do not have to bear our responsibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His troops?" Sid's back, asked in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Royal Security Department combat forces - also known as the Superintendent Corps. We will see everything that will happen behind them."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow around her is explained in a cold tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before August 3, 1666,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jena Narrow Kilometers? Blenheim-sur-Messe on the east bank of the Kings River<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Metz River flowing from east to west follows the canyons inside the hills and ends up in Jena The town of Blenheim in the north point merges into the King River. Blenheim has a small population but is full of pioneering spirit. In South Italy and the New World, there are cities built by these people and with the same name. Therefore, people in other places called the city in central Juarez "Blenheim-sur-Messe". The Royal Mile passes Blenheim on the Metz, and the nearest city to the south is Jena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning hours, the Reconnaissance Force of the Free Army retired from the emperor stationed here, and the town had become a sea of ​​soldiers before noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The engineers are nervously building fortifications, and the magicians are testing the magical movements nearby, and the soldiers are busy camping. The boxes transported by the logistic wagons piled up like mountains, and some live pigs were crowded between the temporary livestock circles set up by boxes, waiting for the soldiers to be pulled into the soldiers' lunches. The troops that are about to leave are whole camps to receive food and special military squads, ready to launch an offensive against the Figota Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord Lopez, the Lenni Army has all crossed the Kings River and is advancing towards the northern tributary Metz. The enemy strikers have come out to meet." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crad Lopez looked at the handsome man in front of him and nodded with a yawn: "In two hours, let 20,000 soldiers Crossing this wide river of kings. At this rate, our army should be able to seize the highlands on the south bank of the Metz River in the afternoon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Pluto? Bonnie, who appeared as a minor, knew that Lopez was not saying "should". Bruto Luther’s troops won the entire army with grassroots control. Even if Krad’s Western Army is directly under the army, the “Second Intercontinent”, nicknamed “Red Devil”, is not prohibited by the Lenny Army. Each battle has a magical support. Each company has a priest who is responsible for psychological counseling. The officers of each battalion can command their own operations. According to the comments of the General Command, the attack of the Lopez Department was unstoppable like a landslide, and the attack of the Luther Department was as pervasive as mercury. In this decisive battle with the Fegota army, the troops were also assigned: the Luther Department was responsible for the right wing and the Central, and the Lopez Department was responsible for the most difficult left wing and the General Reserve. Luther was responsible for covering the artillery and infiltrating the enemy, and Lopez was responsible for the main force against the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just, the enemy is closer to the South Bank Heights, Admiral." Of course, she is not talking about the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther sat sideways on the side of the box, and the bacon in the box gave off an unpleasant smell. She used a small magic to clean the surrounding flavor, then pulled the canvas of the box and pulled a flat space between the two. "So there is new information?" sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From yesterday morning, our reconnaissance network on the southern line began to suffer strong interference. Scouting The squad was wiped out, and the devil and the pigeons were hunted.” Lopez pulled out a large-scale military map and laid it on canvas. “According to the scattered information, the enemy is currently like this... What can you act as a counter? "Things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Indicators..." Major General looked hesitant and pulled out a small silver-embellished box from the top of his jacket pocket. . He pressed the reed and the lid popped open, revealing a small black square inside. "Is this okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You eat this?" Clad frowned. "I saw this thing in the East, where the Ding Ding Warlocks I imported this game from Murrayman to use alchemy. In their opinion, refining cannabis can be seen in the fairy world, but I have not been able to prove this through comparative experiments. I suggest you not to eat too much of this kind of cloth. Ruto, really does not help the ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonnie's fake throat can not help but start rolling, it seems that a burst of laughter was forced to press. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... I think you have some misunderstandings. This is not a marijuana, but a chocolate toffee. Using the chocolate and New Coman in the East China Sea. The sucrose produced is accompanied by a dessert made of milk. It is good for thinking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cradd picked up a toffee and hesitated and let go. "That's right. According to more than forty reports from yesterday to today, I think the emperor is going north along the east bank of the king's river. The strength is about 40,000 to 50,000. The striker has the first division and the fifth." There are enemy trails in the West Bank. We lost three reconnaissance squads, one-eighth of the East Coast. Therefore, we speculate that there are three to five thousand troops who have crossed the King River and may want to advance along the West Bank. The battle of the shore. In this way, the current situation is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie skillfully put the toffee on the map piece by piece and took his words. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The enemy is divided into three parts, and our army is two parts. These nine pieces of chocolate candy are 'central army clusters', now half It is on the east coast north. The next five are the coalitions of the northwestern elves and reserve forces, but there are only 20,000 empire local reserve forces. We are in front of the Fygota group that crosses the central mountain range, and the force is three and a half. It is a united piece of the Principality of the Eastern Empire, but the core Figota army is very elite. The total strength of the enemy is 145,000 emperors and 30,000 emperors, but we only have to deal with it at most. Eighty-five thousand people are enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general will grab a piece of chocolate candy and bite it half, putting the remaining half and three pieces together North of the Metz River. Then she took out another silver box and pulled out the brown toffee from it. She also ate half a piece and placed the remaining half in Jena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is our army. Here your Western Army and my troops add up, it is 65,000 people, Hedong five, Hexi Half. The Eastern French squadron had four pieces left after the war with the Figota army, but they were too far from the main battlefield. There is a piece of General Eugen behind the Elf Army, and you have defensive in front of them. One piece, there is a local army in the east of the Wangren River, and there are two militia units in Lenni. The quantity is not too small, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The color is not before That kind of deep, right? More than half are local troops and newly recruited national troops, and the old troops are more than one-third. If we don’t want to be attacked before and after, we must completely defeat the Figota army in three days. "Clade sighed. "Well, four battalions of self-propelled guns. I will give you two-thirds of the maneuvering power, don't let me and the marshal disappointed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you very much." Bonnie picked up half of the chocolate candy in Blenheim's position and threw it into her mouth. "By the way, another sugar ingredient is coffee from the Free Island of the Intercontinental Sea. It is definitely not opium. If you are interested, you can taste it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I am still eating the Figota army with you... ah, sweet, there is a luxury taste." Clad grabbed a piece of chocolate candy and chewed it, "The logistics of the enemy." The line comes from Fort Worth and the Ridge Mountains, and the King River, which is hundreds of kilometers away, is nearing its limits. Make sure we can meet them back around August 5.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
