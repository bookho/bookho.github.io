			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;viii<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza and the two girls are all tired, sitting on the bed Rough, it seems that it has gone through a careful and not missing search. Unlike before, the girls are no longer wearing the sheets, but wearing a white jumpsuit; the texture of the costume is quite familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Definitely still sheets..." The half-elf maliciously guessed the texture of the jumpsuit. Most alchemists have a number of items manufacturing business, and it is a breeze to change clothes with sheets. The style of the dress is indeed a bit plain, and the manufacturer obviously has no talent in this respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there really nothing?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing. Don't say magic items, not even one copper coin." Reza's face is full of "this white hard work." "The expression, stood up and ready to leave." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, wait a minute! Is there really nothing?" Leonard hurriedly called her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course. What else?" The alchemist stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, they are your property." In the mouth, Leonard’s face showed a relieved expression. "In any case, give it to you, I can rest assured..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard him, the alchemist stunned and looked strange - and The two girls are the same. "Property? Wait a minute, what's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are two little girls, you have been in the New World for so long, and you have not listened." Have you ever passed this law of the sea?" The half-elf asked some incredulously. "To save the lives of others, you are entitled to a return of the same value. If you can't pay off the return, you should pay back in life itself. The first article of the Diza Marine Public Law."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You said this, I remembered it, it seems to have heard this a few times. That is, because I found out and commanded the ship to save them, are they mine?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The half-elf nodded and continued. "This law is formulated to ensure that everyone who saves people can get compensation, so that all The sailors will go to rescue others. If some people are saved, they don’t have to pay, then some people will not go to rescue others...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza interrupted him "At this point, there is less nonsense. It is a slave who has no money to thank for the help of life, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really direct." Nader smiled bitterly and turned to two girls who were surprised and panicked. "Now you should understand? For you, it is better to be a servant to the lady than to give it to others. You don't want to be sold to the slave market? Young girls will be miserable. Now this way Best of all, my conscience will not be condemned, and you will not be sold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this intimidation, just now on "slave The girls who were dissatisfied with the word exchanged a look, and the expression changed completely. They desperately and forcefully nodded and thanked the lady for her help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s so lucky! There is such a kind, gentle, beautiful lady who is the master, we are so lucky!” Cheerful blonde girl with a face He complimented with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We express our sincere gratitude to the woman for her life-saving grace and her grace. We will work hard to repay." The brown-haired girl swears seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alchemists are thinking when they are determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two girls are just the right age and look healthy and energetic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thinking of this, she finally made a decision, and the corner of her mouth floated a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay. From now on, I am your mistress. Introduce yourself, I am Reza; Hermont, drifting 'pure Golden Alchemist '."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you afraid of? Alchemists will not use the living to make something strange." Leisha frowned, the mortal misunderstanding she saw more, and some strange theory that alchemists like to live with people pot. "Although I am your master, I don't want you to call it that way. You have to call me "a noble lady" or a 'lady'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good The distinguished lady." The two girls answered immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, you are owing me debt. This debt is always repayable - for young and lovely girls like you, I don't want to be like other people." That's the direct return." Hearing here, the other three people were relieved. "But the opposite, you have to work for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is of course, distinguished lady. We can do anything rough and tired..." The girl hesitated a little, looked at her sister and changed her mouth. "But it is better not to be too tired."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rough work on this boat naturally has The sailors are going to work, you can't use them. I hope that the work you do is --" Resa deliberately dragged a long sound, "guard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... Guard?" Everyone, including Leonard, was a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s the guard. Of course, I know that the two of them are definitely not working now, so I hope someone can teach me. You say no, Leonard. I see that your fighting style is very flexible, and it is more suitable for girls." The alchemist's tone is very dull, as if to say something that is taken for granted. "So, Mr. Kakawi, they will ask you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...training girls...combat? This, it seems unlikely ..." Leonard replied with a hard scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, you are a "throat". Who told me that he was brave enough to spread the two seas fleet?" Shah first sent two top hats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I still need to train my subordinates..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, as long as it is early every day Just train them a little, you can train the subordinates as usual during the day.” The alchemist’s tone turned, “At least let the two girls be able to rival the ordinary soldiers under your command. If you can’t reach it, then I have to use ordinary means to recover my debts, and that is your responsibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf as an abolitionist stared at her for a while, Sighed. He knew that he had been completely seen and couldn't escape her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I did my best." After that, he turned to the two girls. "Sorry... my training may be a bit harsh, but they can save you on the battlefield. Of course, I sincerely hope that you have no chance to use these things...say, what are you calling?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie; Sefer e sapphire"." The blonde girl replied, "My sister, Bonnie; bonnie sapphire. My hometown is... Well, Lenny."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elves feel a little funny when they hear these two names. This surname is directly called sapphire, which is full of the taste of the guild. Uh... it seems to be full of the pseudonym...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza’s attitude is more direct: “This name is not bad. In the future, Anne’s code is slave a Bonnie is a slave b."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard tried to hold back and said: "Then I will contact the captain and write a rescue certificate. This can give them an identity... Yes, where is Ms. Reesa?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Soma, but this may not be home." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Also, the Soma Principality has not been calm in recent years, and recently it is in dispute of inheritance rights. Is it better to settle in Sanson? Port Ellivi Although it is a little chaotic, it is a good city.” The half-elf did not selflessly recommend the location of the headquarters of the offshore fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I plan to go home and try my luck." The alchemist refused. "By the way, find a room for my slaves, my cabin can't live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group walked out of the door under the leadership of Leonard. Lysa walked to the last to teach her slaves a and b, talking loudly, or let the half-elves hear what should not be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, as a woman, the practice of light is definitely not working. See your hands are very slender, about never done housework? In practice Yu, you can follow me to learn to cook -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A chill sweeps across the half-elf's tongue, esophagus, stomach, until the heart. He slipped on his feet and almost fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leisha; Helmont... Alchemist? How is this possible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It doesn't match the intelligence... There shouldn't be her on this boat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do now? It is rare to have the opportunity to control the fate of the entire Soma Principality. In the hands of..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, let us be a slave first... Hey, be a servant."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, this accommodation is really a mess of slaves... I regretted coming here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This conversation happened in The bottom compartment is a small cabin with a strong musty smell. There is no porthole in the bottom compartment because it is all sea water. There was some mildew straw on the ballast stone piled up there, even if it was a bed. Of course, there is no light in this confinement room, only a few faint blue gleams penetrate through the gap in the top of the ship's board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, this would be a sleepless night...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the captain of the sea corps that night I can't find my own sheets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day at 4:30 in the morning, the light of hundreds of billions of stars shines in the night sky, and only the sky in the east reveals a white fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The so-called...cold...combat skills, only three words...accurate, quick, powerful...so cold...sorry, 'good cold' It’s not the fourth word...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold wind blew, tired of Leonard; Kakawi shuddered, supposed to be full of momentum The opening statement became an intermittent proverb in the trembling teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the temperature, standing on the unobstructed deck of the ship, no one will have the dream of conquering the sea of ​​stars, only want to return Go back to the bed and relive the beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the date, it should be midsummer, but because it is the Great North Cold Flow Channel, the temperature difference between day and night is still quite large. The half-elf looked at the distance and found that the milky white iceberg that could easily break the ship into two pieces floated on the sea in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't seem to be a little "early"..." He never regretted the reason for the debut yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, he glanced at the female alchemist who was full of energy. It’s too early for her to get up...! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buzzing technique in the morning is still echoing in my ear. Although it is only a small trick used by the Masters to practice basic source control, it is really unbearable to call it in the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and continued his lecture: "The most important of the three is - accurate."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Combat, tactics, and strategy are the same: if an attack can't strike the right position in the opponent, it is totally unworthy to be called a threat. All fighting actions, basic The requirement is accurate. On the basis of accuracy, and then guarantee the speed, this is the basic of swordsmanship. Sword technique is killing, and does not require gorgeous movements. It only needs to be accurate and effective... Have you understood?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has only two listeners - and the two listeners, like him, are also poor people who are called at 4:30. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ming...understand...have..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne; Seifer And Bonnie; Sefer reluctantly co-operated with the half-elf, and kept shaking. They have completely changed their dress today: a set of black light leather armor that almost does not affect the flexible action, lined with a very thin silk cotton underwear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each joint is connected with a soft leather, which is closely attached to the body to ensure the protection of the weakest position. The vital part of the trunk is embedded with a fine wire mesh to increase the weight of the thorn without increasing the weight and thickness. The defensive power of the weapon and the arrow; for the female chest and the vital part of the waist, the thick double-layered chest and the solid waist are specially designed. In addition to strengthening the defense, the curve of the female warrior is also highlighted... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most difficult thing is that these two sets of leather are extremely suitable for their owner's size - because that is the time spent by Retha for her two The famous female slave and bodyguard are tailor-made. This creation consumes a lot of magical material and energy. It is estimated that it is difficult for an alchemist to do something with creation or processing before landing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the most obvious advantage is often the hidden shortcomings...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is too close So, it is impossible for the two girls to put on any warm clothing in the leather armor. The brown-haired sister is still slightly better; as for the blonde's sister, even the coix seed has been somewhat scattered, and it seems to freeze to the ground at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, then I will talk about the theory here." The half-elf's endurance finally reached the limit, and the method changed the way to retreat. He was only going to deal with this errand. "Next, follow me to the arsenal and pick the weapons that are right for you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? Is this finished?" Reza questioned. “Is it so easy to fight? I thought it was as complicated as learning alchemy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the principle of combat is as simple as that." Leonard smiled and explained, "The principle is very simple, whether it is fighting or swordsmanship, but if you want to be proficient, you must practice hard and learn in actual combat. In this field, you don't recognize the existence of genius. There are no soldiers who don't have blood on their hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So...that is, there are no such things as swordsmanship secrets? Then you don't want to practice For a long time?” The alchemist complained and took care of the fur coat worn inside the golden robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, but it is. So I will say that teaching women to learn combat techniques is a very difficult thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it seems that I have nothing to become a warrior... Then you continue to work hard, I will go back and do my own research."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this sentence, the other three people, like Daxie, hurriedly praised the great noble sentiment of the female alchemist who heard the chicken dance and studied hard. After that, they rushed to the weapon bay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weapon compartment is always on duty, and the charcoal stove there is lit at any time of the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, the sun hasn’t come out yet, haven’t changed to work...” The sea squad on duty woke up from his sleep and complained dissatisfied with the noise The person who wakes him up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He blinked his eyes - and then saw the sharp, not long ears of the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long, sir! I, I didn't sleep..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the sea was filmed Shoot his shoulders to show appease: "I am not strictly obsessed with the useless rigid dog. You continue to sleep with you, I am only here to take warmth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay...but, but the two are...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resa; Helmont's escort, come and pick two suitable weapons. By the way, picking up a few brethren’s private weapons is no problem?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Leesa; Helmont is...” Reacting that it was an alchemist The name of the guard, the face of the guard immediately turned into a pig liver color, and nodded and agreed. "Please, please feel free. Just don't take the long weapons in the corner..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? You actually have long weapons? Who has this? Practical hobbies?" The long weapon is full of skill, the ordinary short scimitar is inherently cheap, and the demonstration is given to Reza to see it... This idea flashed in Leonard's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Those are those who are completely unfamiliar with naval battles. They are not under our rule, and they take it away."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like almost all sailboats, the official weapons prepared on the Emperor Klein are all clear cuts. This weapon is known as a symbol of the pioneering era and is often referred to as the "pirate machete" in many places. The length is just between the long sword and the short sword. It has enough cutting edge to cut off any rope. It can even be used to cut meat and cut vegetables... As long as it is a warrior at sea, almost everyone knows the importance of a short scimitar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the short curved tool holder, there is another type of equipment that the sailors have stacked: about thirty or forty stalks of "light" arquebuses - a little weight Not light, probably ** kg weight. The reason why it was named "light fire rope gun" is because there is also a weapon called "heavy rifle": the musket with a bracket is about 25 kilograms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guys under my hands can hide a lot of private goods..." The half-elf went to a weapon rack and pulled a switch, gently Push, the weapon rack turned to the other side. He did the same until all the scimitars were magically turned into weapons. "From daggers, short swords, warhammers to swords, tomahawks, sickles, all use them, just pick a handy one. As far as I am concerned, of course, the elf sword is the most convenient - but this weapon There aren't many on board."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that the girls are completely shocked by the number of weapons here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow! It’s all true, real! It looks like a museum...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Anne said that she ran to the side of the shelf and began to look for weapons that matched her mind; her sister stood quietly, observing the soldiers one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just pick, just pick. Nothing to choose." Half-elves have considerable confidence in their ability to use weapons. Most of the weapons here, he can be used skillfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a lighter musket? Pistols and the like." The first question was asked by Annie, who was clumsy with a light rope gun and Put it in front of your eyes for aiming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss, don't be so close to the fire department, be careful to be blasted by gunpowder." Hearing the reminder of the half-elf, Anne reflexively throws the gun under. "The musket can only be used for a one-time attack, and you will not use it at all. It doesn't make any sense to learn it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So...can you connect? The weapons that are sent? For example, things like a crossbow..." Anne still doesn't give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The failure rate of that kind of thing is too high, can not be relied on. The long bow is not bad, the problem is that your courage will definitely not open." Has a hand. "All shooting weapons are unreliable, pick a melee weapon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the dagger is too short, the spear is too inconvenient to carry, The long sword seems too cheesy..." Just like choosing jewelry in a jewelry store, Anne, who died, began to select these weapons one by one. It seems that each one looks worse than the others. "Long-handed axe, too wild... double-edged sword, too skillful... long warhammer, too unconstrained..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See her if nothing happened Lenade was really surprised when he took the long-handled battle axe, the double-edged sword, and the long warhammer from the weapon rack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do she, she have the blood of a giant or a Tauren?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is horrified at him At the time, my sister Bonnie also said: "I am fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf glanced at the weapon she selected: it was two Short dagger, the kind without handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A short weapon, can you use it? The dagger is asking for a very fast movement and a very stable technique..." He reminded him without worry, but Suddenly found that the reminder is superfluous. The soft hands of the brown-haired girl are generally stable and accurate with his own, and there is no tremor when holding the dagger - although the grip is wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is a dagger without a handle, use the gap between the index finger and the middle finger to catch the rounded part of the bottom of the blade. The bottom metal bar - specifically, this thing should be called a 'boxing sword'. You can easily scratch your own by grabbing the bar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, sorry, I haven't used it..." Bonnie's face was red, and she hurriedly changed her grip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
