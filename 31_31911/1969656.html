			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vii<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May+60, Northwestern, May 16, 1664旷野<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every empire knows that the Central Staff of the Freedom Army is established in Lenny, but even the best agents of the Royal Security Department do not know the Free Army. Where is the Western Staff? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander of the Western Army is Klad; General López, this man is like a meteor in the historical arena, the second fastest in the history of the Free Army. The record entered the ranks of the Big Three of the Free Army. He and his command system are too mysterious to the Imperial staff. Today, he leads a third of the Forces of the Freedom, and disappears into the wilderness behind the Empire's main force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Kegler lost, he did not appear. When the Imperial soldiers referred to Lenny, he did not appear. When the Steelburg Army began its bloody battle again, he still did not appear. But everyone knows that he will appear sooner or later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this lieutenant doing? Why is this man fighting? No one knows this, whether it is a northerner or a southerner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the comrades were fighting in Kengal and Lennie, Clade was burying himself at his desk, writing the East with a strange pen Text. His ink was plastered on the walls of the commander's office, and the hard words seemed to resemble some magical runes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General Lopez, time is up." Robert, the chief of the Western Army; Lieutenant Colonel Ayr opened the door, "Three divisions of the Western Army, thirty-four The regiments and 366 companies were all ready, and a total of 47,000 soldiers were waiting for your order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krad did not lift At first, he still wrote those words. In Robert's opinion, the pattern on each piece of paper is similar, a bit like the work notes of a reel maker or a geologist. "Please excuse me, I am so curious, what are these, sir?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The text of the Oriental. For scholars and officials there, this is a kind of A ritual used to kill time and relieve tension.” Clad took the final touch and stood up, “What about the 'Morning Plan' order?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As you told me, they are all here, and one has not been sent." The chief staff member took out a thick stack of commands from his jacket pocket and whispered a few passwords to unlock the encryption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The text on the command book swayed and reorganized the order; the strategic map was also active, deploying the position of each group of the Western Army. This thick stack of commands, each of which is magically encrypted, is unimaginable. Even if one or two orders "accidentally" fall into the hands of the emperor, they can not grasp the real breakthrough position of the opponent, and it is even more impossible to speculate on the overall plan of the Free Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krad went to the front and picked up a few more details, revealing a mysterious smile, as if watching the movement of his troops. "Are you finally keeping the plan within five days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert grimaced and replied: "The staff complained a lot, but they still made it. There are Half of the people thought that the five-day plan was too small, and the other half thought that the planned time was too inelastic compared to the advancement distance of up to 200 kilometers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "This is very good. According to my experience over the years, plans of more than five days can never be strictly enforced, and plans that are too time-consuming will always be dragged to the last day." Clade raised the brush to make it fast. Speed ​​has signed a graffiti-like name on each one. "Traditionally, the Free Army will give the officers at all levels the greatest freedom, but this time the situation is different. We don't have time. You know, the empire has blocked the empire. From the waterways and land roads of Fort Tuni to Lennie, the reinforcements of Interrail and Faws have been unable to reach the capital."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this urgent situation, Robert smiled slightly: "But what you wait for, don't The 80,000 Royal Guards and the Emperor all gathered in the moment under the city of Lenni. Now there are only 20,000 people left in front of our army, almost all of them are second-class soldiers of the Soma and Noel. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So straightforward to say the thoughts of the chief's mind, but will be hated." Clad joked, "Okay, add in all orders." The previous one. If the target cannot be completed within five days, the gendarmerie departments can engage in the law of the military. The fund is not required to be the staff of the department, the department of Klad, and the general of Lopez. All responsibility is for me."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clad patted him on the shoulder: "I know what you are thinking, rest assured. After so long training, our troops will perform better than you think. Temporarily put your sense of justice first. Get up, we are going to be open soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, this harsh order will..." Robert suddenly stopped, "opening up? Can command and The reserve team should have no plan of action."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now there. Focus all magical power on the offense, burn all our camps, distribute all supplies The Commander’s direct reserve team, the Klad’s gun battalion, the heavy artillery brigade and the magic combat detachment acted according to my orders.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sir, please consider again In order to hide this, we invested a quarter of the magic combat budget! We can't rebuild a central station of this size... Besides, there is no reserve team's combat that does not meet the order! In case there is a force that has not completed the task Or the enemy’s counterattack is out of the way How to deal with the violent land!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The thing to give up must be given up, the things that must be obtained must be obtained. After this offensive, all the empire Power will be concentrated on us.” Clad took a plan from his arms and threw it to Robert. “It’s a determination to burn it here. We won’t give orders here in the next stage.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert's eyes stayed on the cover of the plan. The name of the plan is written under the four-color national emblem of the free country. He flipped through the inside pages and quickly read the purpose of the battle, the line and the time. His mouth slowly widened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The original purpose of the morning dew plan is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is me Consistently, instead of fighting the war, it is better to directly destroy the opponent's command system.” Clad’s finger, the commanding department behind him suddenly burned. Robert turned back and saw only a myriad of black flamings flying up with the ascending cyclone, and there was a burst of colored flames in the burning of magical items. There is a flight trajectory that seems a bit strange, and the ash seems to be escaping along the cyclone created by the hot flame. Robert pulled out the sword and put his sacred power on it - but his chief was faster than him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blue sword light pierced the ashes. After a harsh scream, the piece of ashes fell into the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, Royal Security. Your magic pet, how much information did you send back? Let's play." Clad put on gloves. Whispered to the starry sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty minutes later, the Freedom Army was carried away at the largest military station in West Ruhrock. In front of the Royal Security Agents who came to investigate, there was only a cigarette that declared the war to enter a new phase. According to the naming convention of the General Staff of the Empire, the battle received a very lengthy name: "Gistov-Kongle Prominence Defence Campaign"; and the Freedom Army Staff Conference called it according to the code of the plan - <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Battle of the Dragon." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May+61 on the 1st of June, 1961, the US estuary to the mouth of the West River<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half-Elf Leonard; Kakawi stood on his flagship deck and observed through telescope the two things that stretched to the end of his vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the coastline, and the second is the flag of the shore emperor. The colorful flags of the Coman nobles formed another coastline, which was densely inserted on the seawall outside the coastal boulevard. From the short distance of more than 100 kilometers from Lenny to Fort Fort, more than 80,000 emperors have been gathered, plus the requisitioned civilians and mercenaries, it is estimated that more than 150,000 people are besieging these two city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t count how many flags are waving outside the city of Fort Vatican, not to mention the number of empire on either side of the ramp on the Meteby River. National flag. This is not a tactical need, it is purely a strategic show. A team of black uniform soldiers are building a military port on the other side of the river, and it seems that the scale will not be much smaller than the port of Fort. Of course, it is not a water area suitable for building a port, but the empire's huge team of magicians makes up for the shortcomings of this "small". They can work underwater, can clear the tens of thousands of years of mud at the bottom of the river, can deal with the "poor" monsters that appear in the river, and of course can deal with the harassment of the free navy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, the enemy set up a fort at the Estuary River estuary this morning. Two of the cruise fleet were wounded, killing two people and injuring eleven." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The loss is not small. It seems that it is impossible for us to stop them from building the port with our firepower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this time we knocked out the fort. God bless, we blew up their heavy guns and guns. It took at least two days to fix them.” The first officer touched the beard and smiled. The smile looked like a pirate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds the half-elf of his former pirate adjutant Kazmi. He patted the shoulders of the mate to show encouragement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job, be cautious in the future. They ate this loss, and it might not be just the fleet to meet you next time."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first replied tone is full of arrogance: "The word "cautious" is not available in the Navy regulations, only the "retreat" and "death" that are connected together, lord. From the Red Fleet Since sailing the sea, I have not failed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf is trying to learn a few words, then I think that I am not the captain of the Navy’s navy, and feel the chin. Shake his head. He knows why the Freedom Navy has this kind of upstart arrogance. It has a long history, but it has a huge main fleet "Joint Free Fleet" that is larger than the Sanssen Far Sea and the offshore fleet. They follow the practice of the Elf Fleet and dye the sails of the main ship into the same color--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not representing the conservative black, but the red representing the revolution. The people at sea called the ships "red red fleet" in awe, and almost every senior member of his team served in the fleet. These southerners have won each other on land and between elves and northerners, but they have not lost at sea. The maritime traditions of the southern provinces are almost as long as the elves. After entering the age of sailboats, they took control of almost all sea areas with the advantage of warships and sailors. According to Leonard, at this moment, there are more than 1,500 armed ships patrolling on the inner Antelope outside the estuary, preventing any vessel flying the flag of the Empire or the Principality from entering the United States. West River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While he was thinking about this, the Fleet Chief Mage took the bridge from the bilge and held two rolls of parchment in his hand. "Captain, the new synchronous magic communication is here! There are two of yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard took the envelope and looked at the magic seal and shone Heraldry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The letter from the headquarters and the pure gold has arrived at the same time? Did the Emperor ** attack Lenny?" He extended his right hand and used himself as the commander and pure of the river fleet. The two rings of the director of the Golden Consortium opened the two letters. Reading and reading, his face gradually tightened. Seeing his expression, the first officer on the side whistled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a task?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander of the Half-Elf Fleet nodded. "According to the intelligence of the headquarters, the military port will be completed today. According to the information of pure gold, the enemy may try to stop at that port."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many boats of the Delan people? They can't break through us." The big man laughed. "Those who are still pretending to be porters, they really think their 'hu army' can break through here. Unless they fly in!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Or lurking in the neutral fleet. If my vision is ok, it seems that there are two Elf merchant fleets mooring. Outside the estuary?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Mage came in: "Yes, they just got permission to enter Lenny in the 25th Fleet." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let them wait, I want to identify." Leonard picked up the telescope and looked at the two elf fleets. A moment later, he commanded with confidence: "Anchor, shelling the two right-handers of the Sansen fleet, and tearing down the guns on the other five. They should not dare to fight back, but if they counterattack, they will kill them. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dull order gave the first officer a boost. "They really want to use this trick? Please be assured, you, we will be able to complete the task!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slogan is played, the sailors who have already prepared well are flying fast. The speed pulled down the cannon of the side cannon, revealing the muzzle of the black hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two elf fleets were in a mess, and the two boats on the far right were trying to pull up the full range of artillery that rushed into the North Shore military port, which was completely exposed. Their identity. The police sub-fleet in the estuary responded in time, and their garrison mage did not hesitate to drop two wind magics, speeding up their own speed while obstructing the opponent's maneuver. I haven't waited for the two breakout ships to change sails, and their ship's side has almost been attached to the opponent's gun door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, everyone in the empire’s temporary port sighed in disappointment. The port is now open to navigation, but there is still no ship that can break through the blockade of Fort Fortress. The failure of the camouflage fleet ** naked display in front of them, cruelly mocking the powerlessness of the imperial sea power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Looking at the battle situation, probably won't use our flagship." The sigh sighed. "Can't you leave us some?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who said, have you forgotten that we have another goal?" Leonard waved his hand. "Left full rudder! When the turret is still facing the open sea, it rushes up. See the crowd on the pier? That is our goal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Is it a welcoming ceremony?" The first officer rushed to react. Opened his mouth in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You and your country are too young, not enough to understand the bureaucracy." The half-elf's tone is mixed with some relief of the face, and a trace of indescribable Hey, "As a member of the world's oldest country, I understand. Use the thing we have been reluctant to use, the second round."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Your noble Royal Highness Olia, I regret to let you see this scene. Our navy has made a small mistake, and the situation is still under our control..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Colonel, who represents the construction of the army, stammered and tried to push all the responsibilities to the Navy. The cade of the Guards whispered to the ear, and a smile of gloating was on the corner of his mouth. The representative of the Navy is a small lieutenant who has no family pattern on his armband. He has been bowing his head since he saw the scene, and he is probably in the midst of his unfair budget. In order to welcome the first princess Olia who was specially invited to inspect the construction of Gangtou; Hugh; Coman, the entire Fort Vatican was very nervous, and almost all the dignitaries attended the welcoming ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough, don't have to say it." Yanika turned her head and leaned over the whispers of the Guardian officers who were whispering. "I see When I arrived, I heard it. I will report the problems encountered here to the truth, but you can rest assured that this is not the responsibility of one of your departments. You have worked hard enough."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the officers are stunned. The princess seems to be particularly gentle and gracious today, especially compared to the guards around her. All of Olia's guards are women, and most of them are wearing the symbols of advanced spell users, mostly beautiful, but not ridiculous. The guard captain who has been guarding her is even more expressionless. Her hair is silvery, her skin is almost white, and it looks like a silver statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 sighed reluctantly: she has gradually begun to understand what a princess’s job is. The Emperor is like a huge magical array, which requires fine adjustments and arrangements. The armed forces of the empire are distributed throughout the South, and even the emperor cannot see every important place. Because Gustav did not marry the Queen, Olia; Hugh; Coleman has the responsibility to be the emperor's avatar, representing the Cole family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This action is even more important when a crisis occurs. She is one of the few people who are qualified to learn about the crisis. Once the crisis is leaked, it is not only the sway of the military, but the entire army will panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Yesterday morning, all the troops under Lopez's command also launched an attack on Kengler and Gustav. From a common sense, it is so long. It’s unrealistic to command several regiments at the same time, but the offensive was unexpectedly violent and accurate.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning she was also the commander-in-chief of the Empire of Lenny The department listened to Sid’s report. The Royal Security Minister reported the expression of Clade; Lopez. Yanika knows the decisive and determined man, knowing that he will make decisive and determined combat actions - because that is her father, a person who always stands on the side of victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Western Army has copied Gistof, and the remnants of Steelburg have cut off the Royal Mile. If they are allowed to achieve their combat objectives, now our supply is only I can support it for a week here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Duke of Fegota made a military report, and the marshal’s pen was smeared on the map. On the map, "Morning Dew" has penetrated into the side of the Emperor's side, and it has indiscriminately cut off all of them. The blue arrows and circles reappear on the military map, and the gray lines of defense are constantly painted with red forks. There are so many gray triangles representing the emperor, each representing hundreds of soldiers, but they are all hesitated to the enemy without the hesitation of the gray arrow. On the land represented by this silent map, I don't know how many life and death tragedies are happening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembered the expression of the emperor when she said this, and remembered it very clearly. That expression is not a panic, but a calm after a difficult decision. The terrible silence can force everyone to the silence of the corner, no one dares to resist the silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, all actions are still being calculated...not in the calculations, only the strength of her father’s counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are always people who are unlucky, not that we are you... or are we both?" Seneca muttered to herself. Unknowingly, her heel has dug a shallow pit on the soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no navy, does it really make sense to take it here? Her father will definitely choose a strategy that can completely end the war? This can really reduce the number of casualties, but then the people around her will...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can expect that after the completion of the No. 5 turret, the rebels The inland river fleet will be cleared..." Seneca’s gaze swept over a spokesperson of a military lieutenant who was chattering and stayed on the enemy ship on the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of the enemy ship made a dazzling fire, and a black mist shrouded them. She immediately judged the shells used by the opponent - the target is the crowd near the base, no doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"windwall!" Yanika slammed forward and raised her right hand, creating a defense against these small iron beads above the river bank. The wind wall, "Your Majesty, shelling!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excuse me, what did you give me now?" The lieutenant colonel stopped and asked in a wrong way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 replied without any cultivation: "Your Majesty, Stupid!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several responding guards immediately added new protection between the wind wall and the crowd. The silver-like escort captain next to Yanika leapt up, jumped onto the podium, swept his leg, knocked down the man standing in front of the podium, and blocked himself between the cannonball and the 黛nica. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tens of thousands of small lead particles hit the wind wall, some of which were blown away from the direction; the rest slammed into the next electric wall On the force field, only a handful of time spent on magical reaction rushed over. The whole celebration session was a mess, and the screams came one after another. Fortunately, few people were really injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fortress! The commander of the turret is doing something, counterattack!" The commander of the Fort Vatican Legion came out from under a table and was facing The lieutenant colonel of the speech. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, sir!" The commander of the turret climbed up in a hurry and turned to face the river and was about to issue orders, but only saw those high-speed warships. The second time there was fire and smoke. This time they are not coming out of a black fog. The second batch of shelling was only about 20 rounds, but the 20 rounds were even more dangerous than the hundreds of thousands of rounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The purple-green glow is a transmissive enchanting bomb!" "The southern part of the blood is under!" "Defense! Add three layers of defensive magic, no maintenance at hand." The enchanted people use the ray interception!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enchanted shells are expensive, and their materials must use precious magic metal. Each hair needs an intermediate mage to work for more than a month, and the production cost is comparable to that of high-level magic equipment. But the high cost does not prevent people from using it. After all, in this era, making enchanted bombs is the most effective way to carry out remote magical blows without investing in precious magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that the small means used to stop the shots are completely ineffective against such shells. A well-made transmissive enchanted ammunition with a small anti-magic enchantment that can penetrate most of the walls and cause amazing damage to the enemy. To block this physical speed and magical penetration, you need a specially designed protective belt - it is not something that can be made in five minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Awful..." Renee gritted her teeth and began to refocus her magic. To deal with this kind of shell... What should I use? "Mara, stop them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the captain who was called to the name shook his shoulders and replied in a loud voice: "Follow, Your Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her silvery body as the center, the whirlwind began to blow. The body of Mara, surrounded by the gale, seems to be getting bigger, and the golden and silver flashes are moving beside her. Her arms were turned into a huge wingspan, facing the front of the enchanted bullets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
