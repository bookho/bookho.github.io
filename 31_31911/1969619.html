			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint volume of the four chapters Christmas Eve is the bloody hell<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xvi<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dark blue carriage marked with the badge of the Free Navy passes through the Fatila Cathedral, the voice of the evening prayer has begun to reverberate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I haven’t come back in a week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf yawned, murmur Speak to himself. For him, this Christmas Eve is quite bad - it's all because of a well-prepared Shen'an Festival dinner. He looked at the last invitation in his hand and irritated the invitation into a ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is scheduled to start at 6pm on December 24th and hold a Shenan Festival dinner in Hermonte, North Third District. I hope that you can attend.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Southwest Army Commander Klad; Lieutenant General Lopez, Inland River Fleet Commander Leonard; Kikawi"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Similar invitations have been sent to the hands of many powerful men of Lenny. However, he did not want to attend the banquet himself. After grinding on the ship until four o'clock, he went to the business district in the south of the city for more than an hour, and reluctantly called the carriage to go home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the nature of the dinner, he was well aware. After all, he is also a half-elf, and he has eaten more fruits than most people have ever eaten. He stayed in the country of St. Mori, the synonym of "conspiracy," for so many years, and he is not even confused about such political issues. In the long life of the elves, the most confrontation is the conspiracy under the crown of the crown - or what to take to send this boring life? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really annoying to betrayed. It’s a pity..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This will be a dinner related to the highest throne of the Free Army. After Marshal Govar and his entire Northern Army faction collapsed, the officers who escaped the coup d’état were in desperate need of finding new protectors, and the politicians who originally supported Marshal Govar also needed new military agents. Otherwise, Wiener from Fardes will come from afar; Betsy will take over the entire staff meeting - some people will not be accustomed to this matter. Lopez still lives in the officer's dormitory, and only borrows his mansion to hold a dinner of this size. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage gradually approached the door of the mansion, and he could already see the familiar wall. Not long ago, he lived a boring day fishing in a small pond in the yard every day. Today, he also started to build his own team like a big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Parking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard commanded with powerlessness, looked at the pocket watch and found out It’s almost seven o'clock. He shook his head and took one foot out of the door - and then it was stiff. For a time, he could not believe his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple courtyard that was familiar with the past has been filled with colorful light, and various magical lights are flying between the trees, and between the flaming fires. Fire, you can almost hear the laughter of those goblins. A whole two rows of huge automatic statues and armor were decorated on both sides of the road leading to the main entrance. Finally, standing in front of the door was the huge golden statue of nearly two people, greeted the guests majestically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yard has been refurbished, and the pool that he used to spend time fishing to kill time is full of colorful light, and the actress dressed as a beautiful woman plays harp. The well-dressed waiters and maids huddled in the courtyard and in the house to prepare dinners and entertain guests. They didn't know how many people were at first glance. The temperature in the hospital is obviously different from the outside, and the warmth is like spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the human sacred day...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his dozens The first Shenna in the long life of the year. In the saints who believe in the only true church, there is no such festival - specifically, there is this festival, but it is another festival that is completely opposite to this. For the only true church, this day is the day when damn human heretics are apostasy and synonymous with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Kaikawi is back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While he stepped into the courtyard, The guard used a sorghum full of almost aria, and loudly reported. Every waiter and maid stopped their work and quickly and accurately acted as a professional soldier in two rows on both sides of the road leading from the main entrance to the mansion gate to welcome the nobles to meet him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ear, it turned out to be a fairly standard Elvish pronunciation, and Leonard thought that he had returned to Sansen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this arranged by Reza? It’s really hard... is this the so-called 'noble show'?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the name of this "male master", Leonard thought happily. Like a real elf, he proudly heads to the door under the crowd. He used the lingering corners of his eyes to reach the few subordinates who had already arrived first - they and their husbands were rushing to eat at the dessert table filled with the yard, and could not help but smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are back. The host and the guest are here, a bit late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"quel undome ea 'mmane (Good night, hostess)!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf looked up and saw Lisa in a gold strapless evening gown. She stood at the top of the steps in front of the main entrance, surrounded by a faint white mist caused by magic. He subconsciously slowed down the pace, and his eyes could no longer be moved. I don't know if it was because of the magic effect, or because of her shocking beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am back, Happy New Year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched his jacket pocket, I took out a small, beautifully packaged box and handed it over. On the red ribbon for packaging, it was embroidered with a purple thread. When she passed over and untied the ribbon, the mantra turned into a faint purple glow, covering her whole body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a 'protective curse', not a 'blessing'? Isn't the elf's custom of reading Christmas Eve different from us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard smiled slyly and explained: "It is a good holiday in the Sanssen 'split day." On the eve of the day, people wish each other peace. I hope to see you again tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curiosity of Reza was suddenly hoisted: "So, there is no God there to give people blessings." The legend of the legend? Will not bake the flamingo that thanked the gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The church says this: those heresy, sorry, those who are gods He will be sent to wear a bloody red coat and a bloody pointed hat. He is driving a sled pulled by four bloody dream beasts, coming from the coldest endless hell. He will sneak into the house from the chimney and then kill. Unprepared men and women. So we have to grill firebirds, give each other gifts, and bribe these unethical gods. A peaceful night." Leonard looked around. "It seems that the interpretation of the festival seems to be very different from you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter what, One thing is still the same: on Christmas Eve, people have to give each other gifts.” Reza took a finger and took a beautiful wooden box that was one foot square from the huge golden golem around her. “This is accompanied by blessing magic.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard opened the wooden box and saw a red hilt guard with a strange shape. "Is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It took me a week to get it, take it back and try it out." Reza explained, "The technique of your sword." Slightly behind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." The half-elf felt a touch and moved her hand forward. "Let's go in together..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza took the hand without hesitation. "No, I still have a lot of other things to do. My staff is asking me to pull back the business that is enough to make up for today's expenses. You are going to be busy with you. I am going to talk to the government officials."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lonard sighed and asked a person to walk into the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air in the hall is filled with a touch of mist, smelling like a smell of sulfur. A large, well-made rockery is in the center of the empty main hall in the past. The material is red-red igneous rock. The cheerful music echoed around the rockery, sometimes on the left and on the right, creating a happy holiday atmosphere. He walked along the edge of the rockery and found the source of sound and smell. It was a miniature train running on a narrow railroad track. A few carriages filled with small gifts and snacks were dragged behind the train, and they were running around the rockery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This mechanized arrangement is quite stylish..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There is no boiler in this car?! The original heat source can do the same! Unfortunately, if you can design a double reciprocating piston, you can do it all the time... Who designed this?!”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the past, the onion rings did not fall underground, but floated in the air. But with a fixed eye, the half-elf found that it was not floating in the air, but fell on a dwarf's military cap. But the dwarf did not realize that he was completely attracted by the miniature locomotive in front of him. His body was wearing a petite-free Lieutenant Army dress that was not well fitted and oily. It looked a bit funny. For a time, Leonard couldn't think of the military dress of this army. He could only secretly remove the onion ring with a fork and wanted to find a place to throw it away before the ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a hand covered with scars sipped a glass of wine on his fork, and the onion ring fell into the crimson wine. There is no trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, my subordinates have troubled you, Lord Kakawi. Regardless of him, he is an engineering mad."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf turned his head and saw that it was another culprit in planning this conscription. "Happy Pentecost, General Lopez."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now the military is not part of the Fabians faction has been invited to come, active members also come A lot. During this time, I have contacted many of them - obviously, they are shocked by the strength behind you, and are considering whether to call." Speaking here, Southwest Army The commander and the chairman of the temporary staff meeting changed the glass of wine from the waiter. "The recent pure gold consortium of Mrs. Zun has set off a wave in Lennipo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leonard smiled and corrected: "I am not my wife at the moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I guessed, sorry." Lopez understood the nod. Look at the emotions of the half-elves. "Your spirit doesn't look very good. If you don't want to do these dirty political entertainment, you don't have to go, just give it to me. I will promise to give you the river fleet." To full support."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, then I won't go." Nader as every amnesty, quickly nodded his head, felt a ridiculous urge to laugh. According to popular literature such as "The Lord of the Rings" written by the propaganda organization of Saint-Saens, the fixed image of the elf in human society is "pure", "good", "just", even those who are pretentious. Diplomats also often planted an unexpected turn in Hongrinas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lomez turned a bit: "But there is someone you have to see. Let me introduce, this is my teacher, Conti Marshal Fox."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf is alive and busy. Even if he is only a small sea otter in Sansen, he has heard the deeds of the predecessors of the "God of the Freedom" and "The Fox of the Kengler". Behind the gentle smile of the old marshal, there is a heavy experience and talented commanding ability. It is necessary to get the approval of this person, and he will be able to have a place in the army of a free country. His arrival today is a demonstration of Clade’s plan to take over the entire Free Army... support? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am Leonard; Kakawi, from the Sanssen Offshore Fleet, I am honored to meet you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So far, it’s all very good. Next, it’s their own business. After all, they are all elites of the times. Don’t let me down.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russ who actually arranged all of this; Sefir looked at the well-being banquet at a height and stretched out. In order to prepare for this important dinner, she has transferred a capable housekeeper from several stores in pure gold, and also the third-rate magicians and pastors in the consortium - relative to her own, this era can be called "second-rate" "The magician probably won't be more than two dozens - I have come over." However, even with these talents, Reese was still tired and half dead, and arranged for a dinner of sufficient scale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to her original idea, on the first day of this New Year holiday, she should lie on the sofa and sleep beautifully. In order to make a fortune from the hot magic goods market before the Shennar Festival, she did not sleep well in the past few days. Managing a huge consortium has always been a chore, let alone analyzing reports sent out like a flood. Her sister was a genius in building intelligence organizations, quickly establishing an intelligence network that relied mainly on money – at the cost of this intelligence network without any analytical skills and loyalty. The part-time intelligence officers employed by the Pure Gold Foundation are working hard every day to write the rumors of the size as evidence that may be commended, "to contribute to the prosperity of the group." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as she thought so, the sapphire bracelet on her right wrist shone and gave a slight tremor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Emergency news from Kengler? Why use a direct communication method that can only be used once a week?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ress opened the sight of the people around, walked into a nearby room, closed the door, opened the anti-detection magic array to unlock the encryption magic on the bracelet. She lifted her right hand to her ear, and her sister’s calm voice rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tonight is the key moment. Wiener; Betsy will attack Fort Vatican with a handful of elite troops that he can mobilize to capture the empire's secret ambassador. We must find a way to inform Lopez about this news! If we let the Fabians succeed, we will have a big problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riss for this sudden judgment I was shocked and subconsciously retorted: "You mean that Betsy will forcibly attack in order to rob the merits?! This is inconsistent with his conservative style."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Think carefully, you will understand that this is in line with his conservative ideas. Today, the empire's secret ambassador is already in Fort Vatican, and the reinforcements from the north will arrive in three days. The worst case is the Govard band. All of his people surrendered directly to the empire. The best case is that he refused the empire's covenant and immediately surrendered to the Lenny government..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand. "Riss hits the palm," Bicini can choose to avoid the worst results. As long as it catches or kills. The secret of the country, the worst situation can be avoided without any doubt, and they can also grab the first effort; even if they fail, they can undoubtedly interfere with the other party’s negotiations and create a fait accompli for the interim government. He intends to completely open the rennie? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not only is it open, he has to control Lenny. The only problem is that we don't know if this person can face the next situation." After all, in the history we know, he is going to die soon. Although it is unfair, we can’t pin our hopes on him. We can only support Leonard in public and private. And General Lopez."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The signal is intermittent, with occasional silence. Maybe Bonnie doesn't like this kind of interference, but she has no choice but to follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde girl shook her head and changed her face bluntly: "By the way, why are you not paying attention to confidentiality? The secret agent I solved in these two days "Two hands are not counted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know why conspiracy theorists have to render the power of the conspiracy organization, sister?" After a while, I replied. Her response was mixed with smiles. "Because the secret organization that is not known is impossible. The best way to strengthen a secret organization is to let everyone know that it is powerful. Exist, so it is much easier to do work, buy intelligence or expand influence. There is no shortage of people in the world who are willing to take risks and are willing to sell secrets. They just can't find a buyer."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Reese is still suspicious of this argument. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you think? A secret organization with a vague reputation is indeed much easier to develop than a truly complete secret organization. There is no shortage of willingness to believe in conspiracy theories in the world. People. Do the useful information you receive these days increase every day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reese nodded reluctantly, sighed. Perhaps her sister is right... but it is a far cry from the "perfect intelligence system" in her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie continued: "And, can't say that we really don't have any secrets. We don't have Bartholomew? You can take this identity. To deal with Lopez's adjutant Lieutenant Colonel Tedwood, I used to have a little friendship with him when I used it. But you have to pay attention..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie is saying In the key places, the sound that came out of the bracelet suddenly became unclear, and it was mixed with a huge magical noise. In the city of Lenny, some people are using long-distance communication magic. In this era, the magic network stabilization project has not even formed the theory, and the magic communication rooms are easy to interfere with each other. Reese slammed the bracelet and licked her arm, but it didn't help the signal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Indifference... Going back to Lenny... Inducing... Receiving secrets... Seeing the opportunity..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Bonnie; Seifer's intermittent words, she heard another man's low voice, and the person seemed to be talking about similar topics. In this vast city of Lenny, I don't know how many intelligence officers and agents are there. Almost at the same time, Reese and the man were alert to this and decisively cut off the communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Secrecy means..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ress frowned and smiled. That "secret means" is just a fictional identity: most people believe that the control of this huge intelligence system is called Bardot; the only half vampire, the cold blue hair that aims to hunt undead creatures beauty. On the evening of December 7, a considerable number of people witnessed Bartholomew and quietly added it to the list of "warned people." But unfortunately, this identity was designed by Bonnie, and Reese did not know much about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that after Bonnie left, I have never used this identity? Unfortunately, I didn’t listen to her advice... forget it, just meet one face. There should be no problem. Perfect disguise!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading the profile file left by Bonnie and replacing it with a blue-haired female vampire After appearance, Reese went to the front of the mirror and began to carefully examine the masking identity designed by her sister. The figure is undoubtedly first-rate, so it is necessary to wear special-sized clothing. Eyes and costumes have a dangerous sense of provocation, which makes people dare not approach and be fascinated by it. Reese will smile with a smile as she thinks about the gap between this identity and her sister's original image. In her time, Melia Yana; Quillahiya is a person who would be mistaken for a veteran female teacher or a competent female president. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The reason why you choose to pretend to be a half-vampire is probably to make this identity not appear during the day? It’s really smart..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned a few laps in the mirror, and changed a few pieces that looked too glamorous and offensive according to their own taste, and changed their body to be less exaggerated. Until the "temptation and madness" was weakened to the extent of "beautiful and dangerous", she nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The name of the famous Lieutenant Colonel Tedwood is called... Hull? Maybe it should be relatives."<br /><br />&nbsp ;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought about it, went to the window, showed the bat wings from behind her arms, and quietly jumped out and walked into the banquet venue from the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main dishes for large-scale banquets are very vulgar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her; Lieutenant Colonel Tedwood has a social smile on his face, staring at the fragrant truffle steak in front of him. However, no matter how popular the main course, as long as it can interrupt the boring reception, it is a good main course. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table prepared by the owner of the dinner is only two or three dishes in size, each with only one chair, obviously for the convenience of everyone to eat alone And avoid the guests who do not like it. Unfortunately, as an adjutant of Klad and the chief staff officer of the Southwest Army, he cannot escape the guests he does not like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must remember each person’s face and complete countless clinks, conversations, smiles, promises, and paving the way for their future. Clade only talks to the most important people, and Hull is responsible for the young and motivated visitors. Tonight he is like being in the center of a whirlpool, surrounded by a complimented pyramid piled up with praise. He suspects that the average person who has heard the whole life has not had this night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is no longer affected by these words. After a night of nightmare, he was used to looking at each person with suspicion, using false acting to gain the goodwill of others and speculating on the other's true intentions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that the most ambitious, often the most irritating motivation. It seems that the most honest and reliable, often the deepest heart. The praise of the praise The loudest, often the darkest of thoughts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that night, the smiling, calmly, like a blue-haired vampire girl With such rhetoric and resolute action, he smashed his former worldview. The outstanding students of the military academy who lived in praise, almost never went wrong with the intelligence officers and staff officers to look at the world with their own eyes, trying to see their intentions from people's actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Barthes...no, he is better than her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Just kidding." Thinking of this, he smiled and secretly laughed at himself. "It’s easy to talk about this goal. It’s better than us to look at the base where she built it. The poor three small offices are innumerable. The personnel are back and forth, the intelligence is collected, and the conversations in every dark corner can't escape the monitoring. The number of teachers and pastors is not comparable to us, not so much. It is better to say that it is a demonstration... The real protagonist of this dinner should be her and her mistress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this plate to be taken away?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the warm voice of the waitress, Hull responded absently. The waitress chuckled and did not pick up the plates and cutlery in front of him, but extended the slender index finger with purple long nails and gently tapped twice on the edge of the table. The white jade's desktop turned over and turned the tableware that had been placed on it directly into the large table legs, revealing another purple translucent table. Before waiting for Hull to sigh the exquisite design, the waitress took the table unceremoniously, his right leg was on the left knee, his fingers staggered to hold his chin, and he stared at him with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Hull, meet again..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recognize the woman The moment the waiter dressed up the beauty, the calm intelligence officer almost detached his chin. In front of him, it was the half-vampire girl he thought of day and night, Barthes; only Miss. Moreover, there has never been a friendliness: she actually used the metal version of the voice to directly call out his name! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. Hull. Does this mean that she agrees with him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young lieutenant colonel only felt a burst of blood rushing to his head and had to bite his lip hard to prevent himself from blurting out some inappropriate words. He wanted to stand up and salute the lady at once, but he couldn't grasp the balance. Even if he took the chair, he would go backwards and look ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reached out at an unimaginable speed, grabbed his right arm and pulled him with amazing power. The five fingers are as cold as steel, and only a slight pulse can indicate the half of her humanity. She is so strong, and so... gentle? By this opportunity, he hurriedly kneeled down and kissed her left hand to cover his own gaffe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are really awkward, Lord Lieutenant Colonel." Bardot pulled back his left hand and said with a smile. This smile provoked a burst of anger in Hull’s heart. "The reason why I will come to you is for an urgent military situation. Admiral Betsy is about to attack Fort St. Petersburg."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is like a The rifle shells whipped up Hull from the enthusiasm of the first love, and he couldn’t catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you do, you and General Lopez naturally understand. I will arrange the banquet to continue, you can leave with confidence. This is related to the credit, right? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only with the time she said this sentence, Hull understood the situation. He would not doubt the accuracy of the woman's intelligence in front of her: she is much more professional than him. There is no doubt that she is on their side, knowing that this is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your information, Miss only. Is there any price? If we can afford it, we will try our best to meet it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard his question, "Batsey" had a stiff face, then became distressed and hesitant, and finally became a charming smile that was confident and eager to try. "Oh... I only have one small condition. I will use my uniforms and ranks of the Free Army. The sooner the better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her: "Don't you go too... um, okay. We have several female officers nearby, and I will find the right ones and send them immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you You, Hull." The blue-haired waitress jumped off the table and turned to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute." A sudden impulse made Huer boldly call her. "Can you invite you to dance, only... Bardot?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry. We will be very busy tonight, wait for the next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Thoughtally, Reese, who performed very well, dropped the sentence and walked straight out of the gate. Behind her, the officers were almost busy at once, and each found a good reason to leave the evening banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she still forgot one thing: she completely forgot the hostess of the party. When Reza; Hermont, as scheduled, dressed in a new custom-made golden evening gown to play the ball after the main dish, I realized that the two inviters had already died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie! Leonard! Barthes! Your three guys remember me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
