[Search for the latest updates]<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beauty of magic is so sudden Appeared in front of me, I couldn't help but slow down and wanted to see it more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning around, I found that the other three people had slowed down and couldn’t stop breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One, one gas ran to the bridge?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hugh, take a break , white, white silk female, lady..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stopping, only the muscles are slightly sour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that there is dissatisfaction, but only the small stones on the road are mixed in the gravel, piercing the soles of the feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the female thieves in the same group squatted on the ground for a while before they could say the complete words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I have this kind of physical strength, where the guards can catch up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't say it's a guard, even if the horse is running dead? It's a famous thief from the mainland-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Without my permission, we are best Don't preach. Maybe 'White Silk' has a strong opposite."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to the discussion of the three girls, carefully prepare the wording, do not want others I saw that I did not have memories of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are we going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guild of Donggang. There are almost no sisters. Willing to be certified in Westport, the guild supervisor here is a jerk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm, his only interest is to find a way for a beautiful female member to owe debt. Then they forced them to join the brothel run by the guild."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's not be targeted by the guy's men. Even if I won't be forced into the brothel, I don't want to Join the guy's private corps. Too ambitious guild leadership is not a good thing, the guy will sooner or later put the guild resources in an inappropriate place to bring disaster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "That can only take the bridge, the port must have his men. The guy should not dare to blackmail on the bridge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咦?!Walking through the Phase Bridge? So tired!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to these complaints, squint and let the light of the magic net cover On the retina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it's just tired, I should have some options."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic line around seems More intensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless magic threads are flying along the beach, trembling, like the strings that countless roots resonate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The right magic is probably..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treatment and repel fatigue. I don't know these two magics, but the huge cities in the neighborhood are full of relevant information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow the basic tips to focus, sway your fingers and sing a confusing spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Southern spell combines the pronunciation features of the Oriental variant language of Taiping, and it has a similar explosive power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s a spell that has never been used, it feels handy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt that the fatigue of the whole body and the scratched rip disappeared instantly, and the energy filled the whole body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young female thieves looked up in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you. For us to waste magic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silver plate" with trembling The finger touched his heel, where the blisters had healed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her broken shoes broke through the hole, and the old man was already worn on the heel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For ordinary people of this era, shoes can be considered a luxury; let alone these trainee thieves who have not had a last minute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is nothing. If you are willing to learn, I can teach you that everyone can master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H, the guys with badges in the guild don't say that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jade Ring" rubbed his eyes and opened his eyes. There was a hint of disdain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We don't know a few ligatures, even the true magician and the scammers who started the training class can't tell, how can you learn magic? After all, from In such a small human body, it is impossible to make such a big force."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although it looks like that But the magic is actually..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of it suddenly. What is the system of magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be able to read every piece of information in the "Magic Net" and be familiar with every change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is hard for the average person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you only see the magic net itself, you need special knowledge and hard training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, that is definitely not the knowledge that can't be mastered. Although she still can't think of anything, she knows the correct way to master knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You saw the bridge. How do you think this bridge was built?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rely on magic. Everyone in Hong Kong knows that it was a huge bridge conceived and built by the greatest magician of the year-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No, we started from the belief that we want to build a bridge here. To build this miraculous bridge, magic is just a means to realize this belief. The belief in 'building a bridge' itself is from The belief that 'we have to cross the water that cannot be crossed' begins. Even without the power of magic, we will find other ways to accomplish this. Thought is the beginning of everything."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not part of the lost memory, it is like your own soul knows these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the source of magical power. No magician relies on his own power to complete spells. We all rely on countless predecessors and peers. The result is to use magic. Instead of using the power of the individual to use magic, we use the entire civilization to use magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if we are like nothing Is it OK?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes. As long as you have the belief that I want to use magic and start learning, anyone can learn magic. Nothing compares The belief is stronger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three female thieves exchanged their eyes with surprise and seemed to be hesitant to believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of remarks don't let the guys of the guild know that even if the people of the Masters Association hear it, they will be angry..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I know why you are being chased."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi)<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn on October 20, 1666<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase Port Extra Large Supply Ship "Xiyang"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guns roared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army that did not know where it came from poured into the dock, pushing light artillery, and violently fired at the Seventh Fleet parked in the port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boats that shuttle between the fleets don’t look right. The sailors dressed up with guns, fuel cans and torches, gathered in groups of three and five, and began to hunt down the dinghies and frigates that were placed. Their boating skills are very skilled, and they seem to be people who are living on the sea all the year round, maybe pirates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you only look at the artillery porthole, you can see that several transport ships and armed merchant ships are burning. Fortunately, most Fortress Fortresses in Phase Port did not fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this a trap?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first of Major Neremon Soledon A reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seventh Fleet was lured into a trap, and then it was a decisive blow -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Is the Elf Joint Fleet landing?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who! Who among you planned this conspiracy!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the Marshal Wei Taiping?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panic of the cry came one after another, and the crowd in the banquet hall began to move. The SS Marshal of the Seventh Fleet was not present, and people were panicking about the possibility of the entire Seventh Fleet being eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a strategy for Drey Wayne Mandrill?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The elf plundered the Southern State and Meilong County. Was this eye on the phase port?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commander of the Elves and the Imperial Joint Fleet is called Dreyway恩·曼德里尔 (de<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uwynmendelii<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), the total of the West Indy Sea Battle Commander, the enemy of the former Freedom Navy "Five Red" Fifth Fleet. After this brilliant victory, according to the elves' habits, he enjoyed the honorary title of “entlavus”, which means “the conqueror of Intres”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the intelligence of the Free Army, it is an experienced veteran; by human standards, the vast majority of elf generals are veterans. Even the Holy Immaculate Royal Navy, which has always been cautious and maintains its strength, is willing to accept his leadership. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The flag of Sansen on the shore! They have landed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are going back Organize the militia! Sailor, let go of the dinghy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid! Now let go of the dinghy, don't you become the pirate's prey!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these people represent the most powerful family and power in the city, when their personal safety is threatened, they are no more able to hold their breath. Men and women embraced the artillery portholes and saw the artillery fires bombarded at sea and the dinghies covered with the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meti Crosso, sitting next to the door, twisted his body nervously, and the door patted her on the shoulder and motioned her not to panic. . He didn't even go to see the reaction of Olivia Hugh Coleman; dare to sneak into the heart of the free nations many times, the princess of the Holy Empire should not know how to spell the word "afraid". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panic of these people reminded the door, but now is not the time to take action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these days of maritime navigation, he has a deeper understanding of the "fleet" giant. It is not a sign on the military map, but a large and flexible organization that is tougher than an army army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as simple arithmetic can be used to draw conclusions: even with so many dozens of shells, even if the entire fleet does not counterattack, put them here to bomb, I am afraid that it will take a whole day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will lose as many as dozens of small and medium-sized vessels."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; < =""="">-, most of the main ships in this port can leave smoothly, and reorganize a landing war, easily sweeping the irregular army with only light equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By contrast, the cost of ambushing an army in such a huge port as the Port of Port is really terrible. Abandoning the treacherous traitors and intelligence networks, and changing the shells of thousands of light cannons in the orientated port, it is a foolish stum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the goal value of a battle is low, it means that there is a bigger attempt hidden in the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, there is a fleet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only investing in another size The huge fleet can completely defeat the Seventh Fleet attacked in the port...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi sitting across from him suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You seem to be very calm, the overseer makes you. Is this attack in your expectation? Or is it simply designed by you?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young female leader and his men were completely flustered, as if the attack had not happened at all, showing striking discipline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the chaotic time just now, they even took food from the buffet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these people are enemies, it’s really a big problem, and the door is thinking in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On this issue, I don’t know more than you. The Marshal Wei Taiping organized this banquet. I am just a guest like you. ——”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this reply without actual content, Zhang Shiyi’s eyebrows wrinkled slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorkeeper noticed the opposite emotional changes and the tone changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, I am also cheated by Wei Taiping like you. As for your question, my personal opinion is that it is very possible. You are very I got the news of the party early, right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi nodded: “The official banquet was sent to us three days ago. "The hands of the people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time is enough for the elf fleet of the narrow sea to organize a surprise attack. From the ports controlled by the elves and the Empire to the phase port, Two days or so of the voyage. I think the purpose of the Guardian Marshal is to bring the Elf fleet out and give them a slap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For Drey Wayne · Intreus, the attraction of this bait is hard to resist. Missing this opportunity, he probably can't transfer the Imperial Fleet out to participate in the sea battle. But... I still don't believe you will Nothing to know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi is playing with his own yellow hair band and stares at the door Eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman taught by the yellow towel usually decorates her hairstyle with a yellow ribbon and a ponytail, and deliberately stays longer, borrowing when she needs to pray or call for magic. Zhang Shiyi is no exception. The yellow ribbon fluttered between her slender fingers, as if it were magical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wei Taiping is obviously not on this boat, and I have not seen enough arrangements. Are you really the person in charge here, the Warlord makes you? From which point of view, it is up to you to be responsible here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear these questions, you are embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this female yellow towel handsome think that he is responsible for this boat? What is he responsible for this ship?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will not be a naval battle. He did not see any commander of the main fleet on this ship. Wei Taiping sent representatives such as deputy commanders and cruise captains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it defense? Although the "Western Ocean" is a supply ship, it is also a heavy artillery ship, not those small boats that can be attacked. Together with the guests, there are hundreds of magic users on the ship...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This number made him violently react. If some of these unarmed people carry weapons...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this ship itself a target? That 'Intres 'How many people have come up? Or how many families can be tempted to betray the freedom of the country?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thought flashed quickly in the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreveen’s goal of investing all the chips is not to blow up a few ships, but to seize, or at least to smash the port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ship is gathering all the heads of the phase port... It is more valuable than the flagship of Wei Taiping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has to admit that the analysis of the girl opposite is correct. If Wei Taiping wants to intercept the enemy fleet, it is only he can take responsibility for this ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the door is raised and the answer is: "I am sorry, I don't want to answer this question now. However, if things develop like you Can I ask for help from you and your friends?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi suddenly stopped the finger of the hair band: "How do you know that we are Standing on your side?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yellow ribbon hangs between her index finger and the ring finger, forming a beautiful cross knot. If she is also a magician, the speed and accuracy of the gesture must be very high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I certainly don't know. But I hope that you are on our side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The door shrugged and replied cheerfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi stared at his eyes for a moment, and the body leaned heavily on the back of the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe that the right way creates everything, and Li Er is its spokesperson... well, you can count us on your side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She let go of her hand, and the complex rope made up of yellow ribbons spread out to the original suppleness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the door heard a soft bang from the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the sound, but only saw the head that Olia turned away, and Leonard Kay who was coming here with the guards. Lieutenant General Kawi. Reza Hermont is behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord Soledon! You are fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf sneaked a glance Other guests on the table hesitated. Naimeng immediately stood up and walked over to him, listening to the half-elf whispering the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The captain of the ship just received a message from Lord Wei Taiping. He said that he hopes that you and I will protect the ship and he will solve the incoming fleet. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I guessed it." Naimen frowned. "Is this enemy fleet just what he brought?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard followed and sighed: "The captain also conveyed such a sentence, 'If the banquet is not enough, give it to the boy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand. This free dinner is really not good..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The crowd on the side of the ship suddenly dispersed, and people screamed and shrank back to the center of the banquet hall. Several rockets with burning arrows were shot through the cannon's porthole and nailed to the ceiling and floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small, small boats surrounded us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is our Free Army?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The door is not in a hurry to appease the chaotic crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath, closed his eyes, switched to the vision of the magic net and watched the audience with vigilance. After changing to the position of the staff officer, the banquet seemed clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about 300 guests on the site. Considering that there are also lower-level venues, there are an estimated 500 people on the whole boat. Each group of major guests has about 20 guards, and he has made those gatherings a potential threat in his heart. His gendarmerie and Wei Taiping’s guards were scattered throughout the banquet hall, with a total of two hundred people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If this is the amount..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took Metty from his seat Pull it up, push it to the side of Reza, and turn to the half elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Hermont, Metty is pleased to give it to you. If this guy has no instrument, it will be similar to no magic. Lord Kakawi, you Leave half of the hand to me and bring as many people as possible to the upper deck to prevent the enemy from boarding the ship with a hook. Give it to me here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really Question, sir? If I take away most of the guards, there are not many people here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard Kikawi asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf is one of the few soldiers who knew him before he became famous. He knows how much strength Nami Soleton has. It is hard to say whether you can get a formal badge in the Masters Association by relying on your own skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the right hand clenched the fist and patted the left chest medal. The sapphire chain is stacked underneath the Medal of Excellence, close to the heart, giving him a bit of confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please raise the flag of the gendarmerie for me. Inform the various companies to land on the premise of ensuring their own safety and clear the enemies occupying the pier." If the navy cooperates, it should not be difficult to clean them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no problem here. If I didn't guess wrong, soon the avant-garde fleet will have news. It’s passed back.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard Kikawi’s return to the door of an army-style standard military salute A naval wave of ceremonies, watching the naval lieutenant go up to organize defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The behavior of their guards finally caught the attention of the crowd. The big men who were still high above have come over and cried and asked them to provide protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the commander of Marshal Guardian! Click on the enemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Go to a safe place! You can arrange it quickly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few guards left behind struggling to block the crowd, but their power is not worth it in front of the panicked crowd One mention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give me a stop!" Naomi broke his mouth and slammed his fist on the table. "Are you a ruler of Phase Harbor?" A few pirates! Let's spread now, do you want to be solved by a single bomb?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear the "cannonballs", the ladies and the ladies scream Get up, go back, the crowd is finally calmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am the Majority of the British Superintendent, Master Naughty Soledon, at the request of the Marshal of the Peace, to protect you from danger!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is shouting and thinking about how to solve the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no time to tell who is the enemy, and it is impossible to make this speculation public, it will only cause greater confusion. Nor can he let the situation go so chaotic, which will only create a greater advantage for the enemies who sneak into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to prevent the enemy from attacking with the artillery porthole, please come back to the middle! Please spread the men, and spread them around the ship's side and the banquet hall to defend the ladies! Don't worry about their families and guilds first. Listen to my command!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men face each other. In this case, no one would show weakness in front of the ladies, but they had to listen to the arrangements of the guards and naval officers, and spread them around the venue. The chaotic crowd slowly reduced from the outer circle and was not affected by the melee on the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorkeeper noticed that some people in the crowd were whispering in the low voice, and some people were exchanging their eyes, but he did not know who was the inside. His hand has been pressed against the hilt and he is ready to deal with the accident. If the enemy's inside line is scattered, it will not pose any real threat to the ship. He estimates that those people will start before the evacuation is completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the crowd has less than one hundred people left, I don’t know who is yelling in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shouting is in Elven, and the door can’t hear what he is saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who repeat this sentence in standard and oriental, and he can understand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get started according to plan!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this last hundred people, about More than 20 people took out their weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the crowd exclaimed and fled around, many people were caught unprepared, and even the big man like the bishop of the treaty was surrounded by The Archbishop of the Elves wore the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the Sun God Church a commander? It’s a big money! Follow me, don’t let them control the situation!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door pulls out "benevolent", with a wave of left hand, he wants to join his own Guards and a few naval school officers and eunuchs into the enemy group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just took a step and suddenly grabbed his collar and dragged his body backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not waiting for the door to react, the three or four arrows crossed from his original position, hitting the shoulder of a former guard. The magic attached to the arrow broke open, and all the equipment of the guard upper body disappeared together, leaving only one military pants. He was unprepared to want to find the weapon again, but was caught by a spearman opposite the opportunity to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cleavage?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is recognized by the magic of those arrows, and my heart is also Secretly surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic is designed to deal with enemies with powerful magical items - almost exclusively for him. As long as the magic equipment on the door is removed, his remaining combat power can be said to be worthless. He is sure to have the equipment to survive the lysis, only this justice, and Anne's memory gems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t have to look back, he knows who saved him. On this ship, only that person has been paying attention to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, that is almost equivalent to the intuition of the unpredictable prophet, only the successor of the blood of Coman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he just deliberately ignored it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Your Bishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't call her pseudonym, nor called her The real name, but called her faculty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey." Oria snorted again as an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard! The high-end scroll that I bought from that guy is so wasted!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The attacker commander behind him cursed loudly, letting the two realize that there was no time to continue chatting. When Nami heard that the Archbishop of the Elf Church was not the commander, he stopped and did not participate in the melee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sneak enemy forces were wearing three suits, which appeared to be mixed into different chambers of commerce and family. The enemy commander stood at the end of the array holding the folded crossbow. It was a hazy middle-aged man with a short stature and a flash of cold eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Those yellow towels, you can't escape! You are also involved in plotting, let's get started!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; That person's words made the face of the door slightly change, he violently turned his eyes to the mixed-race female commander sitting at the round table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know when, Zhang Shiyi’s men have all been retired to four weeks. Seeing the sharp eyes of the door, one of the followers apologized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, we are not trying to escape the battle. Just, the handsome man has decided to take the shot, we are just superfluous."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy also heard this sentence. On the other table, the yellow towel worshippers almost stood up at the same time and took out the weapons hidden by the martial arts, all pointing to the direction of Zhang Shiyi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since it is exposed, kill the Sai Yide woman!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi chuckles , grow up. Probably because of the mixed blood, she is much shorter than the door, probably only about as high as the development of Metty. However, there is an indescribable power in her that will make her forget her relative shortness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I swear in the name of the right way, who will stand on your side, and supervise the army. I hope you don't forget the contribution of our cross-sector." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her words are even more angry with those yellow-scarred trembles, and two of them waved a steel knife made of Taoism and rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xiao Nizi who doesn't even have weapons! Don't be too big!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No need to talk nonsense!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi broke his voice and leaned slightly, his right hand slamming on the legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legs of the table are made of huanghuali, which should have been sturdy, but was broken by her palm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a gun?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She grabbed the table naturally The legs, on the side of the body, are erected to form a stance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Zhang Shiyi is no longer the Wenjing girl with a ponytail, but becomes a killing oriental warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She picked it up on her toes and kicked the entire table into the air, blocking the two steel knives of the attacker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade is plunged into the table, and no one has penetrated the sturdy table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi grabbed another leg, his wrists twitched; the round table top turned, and the two had to squirm and let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the other party to restore balance, her knees move forward again, using the weight of the table in the attack on the two people’s stomach, hitting the two directly Overwhelmed under the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two knocked yellow towel attackers made a sigh . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi waited for them to push open the table, took a step forward, jumped on the back of the table, and jumped to the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her left and right toes just stepped on one's throat and broke their screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, she threw her back in the table and knocked down a guy who was ready to copy her from the side. The legs of the table were worn in the eyes of the people and directly penetrated the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All around, including the well-informed Namen, Olivia, and the enemy's commanders, all stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May the right path be with your soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing the prayer, Zhang Shiyi broke a table leg and grabbed it in his hand like a short gun. Pulled a gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A bunch of fools! Even a woman can't make it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send this giant It is a giant black-skinned man with a yellow headscarf covering all the hair, which looks like the leader of the group of yellow scarves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The little girl who nicknamed the name of Sai Wing! I will take back the name given to my uncle today!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This giant man is holding a three-pointed warrior with a magical charm. The style is different from that of the common axe guns of Keman. It is probably the weapon of the Eastern Empire. The three tips of the trenches are trembling slightly, like a viper, to choose people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Name--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi leaned over and the other side’s sharp point Only picking up the yellow ribbon she used to tie her hair, her dark long hair spread out like a tidal wave behind her shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"--You are not qualified to judge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She licked her lips, body shape The first one, the table legs of the right hand rose upwards and stabbed each other's throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the gun was stabbed, her opponent had not recovered her long hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seemingly light thorn immediately poked the seemingly tall and mighty Taiping, and the sharp cut corner pierced his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough...hehe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the yellow towel leader trembled violently, throat Bleeding in the spray, splashing a few feet away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legs of Zhang Shiyi’s hands were pulled back and were not caught by the bones of the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that the right way creates everything, and Li Er is its spokesperson..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Zhang Shiyi whispered the prayers of the funeral for the adversary, and pushed the right hand to use the corpse to block the route of the other three enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that the right way has produced one..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She continues to read the creed and lifts it up On the toes, the body whirls lightly, and the two arrows that are shot are nailed to the legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...one produced two, two produced three,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The legs of the table were lightning-fastened, and each of them was in the throat of an enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...and three have produced everything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three yellow towels are still unacceptable The color, but their body has fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Zhang Shiyi ended this round of attack and his right hand once again constructed a gun, there was no living left in that table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy commander pointed with a trembling finger The terrible female goddess, wants to order the siege, but dare not say this order. Zhang Shiyi has already killed everyone in this battle. He does not know how many people dare to come forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to ask 'come to the name' in the drama, you have missed the opportunity. And you are not qualified to know my name. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table legs in Zhang Shiyi’s hands trembled as if there was a gun at the tip of his blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of skill and intuition can only be possessed by the talents who have been killed in the blood of the corpse, and only the Murraymans of the sects who have been fighting each other all the year round. There are conditions for producing such a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door can't help but sigh. Upon hearing this sentence, Olia on the side gave a soft "哼". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. The magical thing, you still don't mess up the conclusion. Pay attention to her hair."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hair...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the door and looking at it, I found that Zhang Shiyi’s hair color seems to be somewhat different. If you remember correctly, it was... close to the dark yellow honey hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hair color is getting darker?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olivia continues to explain: "It should be A kind of 'daoshu'. The difference between appearance and ritual is very important in religion... For example, I also have similar the magic that will make the appearance change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first princess of the empire said, use his right hand to draw a holy emblem on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the fingertips, Olivia’s original white skin was covered with a layer of translucent metallic silver, exuding sacred light, faintly revealing Come out with red and blue blood vessels below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven’t waited for the door to ask the question “What is this god?” Oria’s figure has turned into a white light into the light hand Among them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike Zhang Shiyi’s light, concise, and skillful killing, Princess Olia Hugh Coleman’s tactics are much simpler and more straightforward. That is the orthodox method of warfare that has been seen by Naimen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is faster than the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is stronger than the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be alert to all dangers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relentlessly counterattack any attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overwhelming power of the bloodlines of the sacred imperial family of generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olivia's silver figure doesn't care about extra moves or wasted attacks, just knocking down everything that was intercepted in front of him with great power and unimaginable speed. enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver-gray arm is like a real metal blade, easily cutting the enemy's muscles and bones, her fingertips constitute the natural blood The trough does not have a trace of excess blood on the translucent skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a total of eight pickpockets, which together only lasted for less than a minute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After killing this number, Olia’s figure suddenly stopped, glanced at Zhang Shiyi, and then returned to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe the commander of the other party is a loyal subject of the empire, I am not convenient to take it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Olivia whispered a whisper, and put away the magic, if nothing happened behind the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door hesitated and replied: "Thank you anyway..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He took a small step forward and staggered with Oria's shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can feel what the imperial princess wants to say, but somehow she did not say anything at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Retreat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the enemy commander who has gone, standing farthest from the deck He tore a reel and jumped out of the artillery porthole before being surrounded by people around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The array of enemies also fell apart, leaving only the elves led by the elf bishops still recalcitrant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the two attackers did not have a unified command. Judging from the fact that the enemies in the back are dominated by human beings, I am afraid that it is only a loose organization of local guards, adventurers or thieves' guilds, so it is not related to the previous Elf Rangers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhang Shiyi, who was carrying a blood-stained gun, smiled heartily and walked over. She did not seem to see the look of the back-to-back two people, nor did she ask any questions about the empire of the Orthodox priests and the Freedom Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door immediately entered the working state. He turned and greeted him, and bowed to the ceremony in the East: "At least I personally will not forget the help of your cross-channel sects. And I don't want a brave woman to stand in the opposite camp." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi was busy putting down the legs in his hands and slightly bowed his body: "I have no confidence in this sentence. Also, I have not married yet," I am brave but it will cause trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nelly did not see any "disturbance" from her expression, only noticed that her hair had recovered The original honey color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, I just heard them call you... Sayid or something? What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This flattering clearly noticed the other party's itching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is a honour. When the Taiping Church was still in the heavens, it was once fought with the imperial ambassador named "Yingde", but there was no victory. The best result was just a tie. At that time, the great Tianshi personally awarded the title of 'Saiyi De' to the general who could be tied with the famous and retired. Since then, 'Sai Yide 'It is the first name of the Taiping army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first-rate slam. It must be very difficult to get this title?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi sighed and seemed reluctant to answer this question: "Where. The deceased father is indeed the 'Saiyi De', the 800,000 Taiping of the Qingniu Prefecture The military guns are the first. The little woman is not talented. She only has a "wing" of his old man, and has not been to the Green Bull House. Although some people will call me "Saiyi De" or "small game wing". De', but that is only a nickname after all, but unlike your two excellent chapters, it is a real contribution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, my work is not really hard. According to my credit, I am afraid that I should not get it at all - it should belong to Anne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although thinking about it in my heart, of course, the door does not say the words of these beautiful scenery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, can I call Miss Qu Shuai you to do 'Sai Yi De'? It seems a bit wrong to call your name according to your etiquette."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want, you can call me 'winglet'. Don't think too much, it's an abbreviation for 'small match wing'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, but the door can clearly see that Zhang Shiyi’s mouth has been shaking, she obviously appreciates the nickname she came up with. At the same time, he heard Olia behind his voice screaming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The princess of the original empire is also in the Eastern language, and the laughter is quite strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We will talk about it after the battle, Miss Wings. As long as my overseers are within the scope of power, do not endanger the interests of the free countries, what conditions? Can discuss..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about my one?" Oria suddenly inserted and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand of the sword holding the sword shook a bit: "Of course, it will not be forgotten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the reward, don't let me down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The princess of the empire chuckled and suddenly grabbed the neck of the door and kissed him in his ear. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful with this woman. Of course, be careful with me too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She uses only the other party The whisper heard was in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main force behind the eyes is going to be The two women swept away, but he did not control the scene in front, and the elf archbishop who commanded the troops in front of him was in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guards of the Independent Gendarmerie and the Seventh Fleet placed on this ship are all elite. The high-ranking Navy officers who are here are mostly combatants who have fought in battle and are not weaker than the secret forces organized by the Sun God Church. The Archbishop bit his teeth and had to resort to his allies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let her stop! For our joint fleet battle, please join us! If you add a cardinal, you should be able to serve our fleet." Capture the phase port..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver cardinal shakes his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't order her. The Sansen people and the Senate are the allies of the Holy Coman Empire. - But the Sun God Church is not orthodox and Dagong. The ally of the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no such thing as an elf priest. He took a step back and left the threat of Ionite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Ionet just bounced his fingers, and the silver silk hand he brought became a giant sword with a length of one person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You traitor-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette Hartman Cardinal The giant sword in his hand easily flew the head of the elf archbishop and at least three layers of protective magic around it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head with a pointed ear flew out of the artillery porthole and landed in the sea, splashing a dark splash of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a pity that our holy empire is a civilized country separated from politics and religion. It will not participate in your conspiracy. And who is going to shoot this? I can't do the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver cardinal sighed and the great sword returned and turned into a silver handguard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least on this boat, you are not playing. In the final analysis, the outcome is not dependent on the situation here."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves around him have thrown their arms and surrendered, and several people have jumped out of the window to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door quickly ran to the side of the porthole and pulled out the pistol, but saw that the leader of the escape had landed on a small boat dozens of meters away. Above, beyond the range of his pistol and main magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even at this distance, Nami is faintly able to hear the man’s bark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reorganize the second attack! Isn't it a boat? It's a big deal to sink it! Concentrate all the gunpowder and sink it!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first glance, he does have this strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dozens of boats around the "Western". They are not equipped with folding handcuffs like the Rangers who sneak into the ship. Many ships are equipped. The musket is even a one-pound gun and a light magic cannon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is obviously not a wise choice. It takes a long time for such a large warship to sink, enough magicians to transfer the passengers above. Even the other people on the dinghy are trying to discourage the commander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The leader! Please retreat immediately! Now you have time to escape to the sea!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to open Joke! Lost the foundation in the phase port, do we still have a way out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea suddenly darkened, and the huge shadows approached those who hit the torch. Small boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a huge sailboat that only hangs about a quarter of the sails. The fire-resistant red sails are high, and in the dark, bloody fluorescent lights are also emitted, showing off the identity of the main ship of the current battleship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It slowly advances under the push of the night wind across the sea, sliding over the sea unstoppable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people on the boat saw its signal lights. It was the marshal's signal light of the Seventh Fleet, and the commander of the Navy Marshal under it danced in the evening wind. On the command flag, the word "wei" was written with the Chinese characters of the East. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their shouts are desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant ship ruthlessly smashed all the boats on the starboard side and slowly stopped at the side of the "Western". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the gun doors are fully open, the deck is full of heavily armed soldiers, and the dinghy is constantly trying to paddle away from the sea with a rifle shooting. After those rowing boats fled, the "Pingbo" took up the sails and slowly leaned toward the "Xiayang". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Marshal is coming! We are safe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live the Seventh Fleet!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guests who escaped from the air cheered up the upper deck, and even the officers of the Seventh Fleet began to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was finally relieved, holding the edge of the porthole, and the whole body was almost soft, and I felt an indescribable feeling in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t want to go to the upper deck to meet Wei Taiping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, it didn't cause much casualties. Wei Taiping, the crisis you brought almost lost the entire phase port... At least the first notice Let me speak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Resist the door to calm down, I feel that Wei Taiping should have prepared enough contingency plans in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His flagship appeared at the speed of the "Western" at such a rapid rate that he was not completely unprepared. It must be in the position of the fastest flagship team to rescue this banquet ship in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if Nami Soleton himself died on the "Western", the combined fleet could not control the phase port. Just send another superintendent to make it happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If everything is normal, banquet, port, and political power. If the other party can't help but make a surprise attack, use the prepared plan to fight back and get a rare one. The main battleground opportunity. In order to ensure that the overall situation is not affected, the action plan is limited to the core of the Seventh Fleet... odious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I still feel quite dissatisfied However, Naimen had to admit that Wei Taiping did not make any mistakes in the command. Although there are many cards from the Elven Archon, there are not many cards that can't be dealt with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the kind of strategy of carving insects, but the battle plan of the bright and straight, probably also let the naval staff spend a lot of effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, this is also work. For Wei Taiping, I am the unstable factor in the whole plan? After all, the entire Seventh Fleet is He is in the old class in the East, and only Leonard and my troops are unfamiliar with him. If we can't rely on it, of course, he must use his own people to control the phase port to fight with peace of mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Through the cannon porthole, Naimen knows that the "Pingbo" has completely stopped, and that the flare in the direction of the port is decreasing. Under the battle of the Seventh Fleet Marine Corps and the Independent Gendarmerie, the battle over there seemed to be all right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head hard, dispelled his dissatisfaction from his mind, turned and walked to the top deck with his own guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the door was on the deck, he heard a few applause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The source of the applause is some distance from the hatch, on the "Pingbo". I want to shoot out the applause that I can hear here, but I need a lot of power, and my palms will be red and swollen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the applause is of course the Marshal Wei Taiping. As soon as he applauded, the naval officers around him naturally began to applaud, and soon all the people on both boats began applauding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is our greatest fortune to have the Warrior Soleton Warlord on your ship. I propose to cheer the Lord for the Warlord!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take a toast for the Warlord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the "Western" comes up with a glass of wine There are not many people on the deck, but the Navy of the "Pingbo" is a porcelain cup for the school officials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
