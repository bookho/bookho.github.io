"Magic muddy area"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***-***-***-***-* **<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon is a creature that feeds on magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon is the embodiment of fear, they stand at the top of all creatures, with near-infinite life, almost invincible combat power and near-infinite magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like humans, dragons are also intelligent creatures, with great knowledge, and also have a beastly side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver Dragon Mara never thought that he would have to run away like this; but the situation in Jena does not allow her to think more, she only Can rely on instinct, with a wound to the south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before hearing the loud voice of the enemy commander Clade Lopez, Mara knew that the big event was not good. She has served as a royal advisor to the Holy Empire for hundreds of years and has a keen sense of military, political, and conspiracy—although there is usually no interest in participation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her partner, Nika, decisively chose to surrender and escaped to the south to report the battle through the magical order. She is a very smart and determined girl, Mara thought a little regret. In the history of the entire Coleman Empire, there are very few talented women who enter the court. "The Emperor's fangs and claws" left the army that was being defeated and flew to the south along the hilly terrain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what happened yesterday afternoon. But by last night, things were different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After flying over a distance of more than 30 kilometers, Mara suddenly felt a discomfort, and she found that the magic field around it had undergone dramatic changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change is difficult to describe in words. Just like a sailboat suddenly breaking into the sea covered by the tsunami and storm from the calm sea, everything around it began to follow different rules. Every magician can feel this difference, their hands will start to tremble, instinctively want to struggle to grasp their own steering wheel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the dragon is not a human magician. This effect is more drastic than the dragon's magician to humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If humans are used as metaphors, Mara is now in a state of near-plateau hypoxia. There is still a lot of air around, but the oxygen in these air is not free to be used by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wound that was torn by the devil on the wings lost its magical protection and began to bleed. The clouds suddenly appeared and began to shower, and a gale came blowing in the face, blowing her wounded wings back and causing pain in the cone. Even if a brave man slid into her skin with the sword of the dragon, it would not be much more difficult than this. Mara suddenly lost the balance of the flight and rolled to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mara had to become an adult and forced to "land" in a piece of woodland. She got up from the dust and found that her military uniform had been smashed by shrubs and had to be taken off. She found a common dress from the pocket to barely change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic is no longer useful, she can only look for signs of human activity in the direction of magic concentration. In the midst of chaos, some seem to be the magical flow caused by man, she decided to follow these invisible rivers. After wrapping the injured arm in a branch, she walked south along the difficult path in the hilly land, looking for a place to stay overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a few hours, and three more rains. Mara, who is cold and hungry, misses the steak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw two or three farms on the road, but regretted that the farm had no lights. The owners of the farm may not have fled to other places, or they have lost their lives in the tug-of-war between the North and the South. One farm was obviously looted, and there were only some charred black wooden beams left in the barn and the house. Some animal skeletons were randomly abandoned in the nearby empty field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner should be a gentleman who is still rich, and some will not be considered deep magic. The family also organized a small army consisting of a small number of people, mainly relatives, relatives and tenants. In front of his house, the sign "The loyal subjects of his majesty" issued by the Royal Ministry of Security hangs, which proves that the owner has paid taxes and provided help when the emperor passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mara met their sentinel sentinel. These armed peasants were still gentlemen, bringing the injured lady who was in the wild to the farm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a stove in the restaurant on the farm, and there are about thirty or forty people. In addition to the owner's family, there are also his tenants and serfs, other peasants from nearby small farms, and others who look like refugees, deserters and travelers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mala wants to buy some porridge, and the owner is bold and said that the porridge does not need money. She had wanted to buy some steaks, but the owner just shrugged and said that all the cows were towed away by the Imperial Investigation Unit in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I didn't hide some wheat, I am afraid that even the porridge is gone." The host said with self-deprecating, "They also stated that the day after tomorrow, the troops will levy us." Here. Young and beautiful ladies like you are still avoiding as early as possible. I heard that there is no virgin left in the area around Rennie. There are some girls in status who have fled into the capital, or else It was to cross the river to go to Imiya, or to go to Interlake by boat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the supply of the main force of the Empire has been fully eager, she judged. "So there is wine? I want to invite everyone here to have a drink."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner smiled heartily: "This lady, here is Jena! Meat It doesn't have to be, but if you want to buy wine, how much!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daughter of Yinlong turned out a few old empire silver coins to pay for the wine. These coins caused a burst of exclamation. The owner of the farm passed the coins to all the people in the house and let them pass them one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't accept this, Ms. I am also a person who has been at the University of Lenny for a few years. If I am not mistaken, these are the Sylvesters. The silver coin of the Victoria III! That was five hundred years ago! If you sell this to Lenny's antique dealer, you should be able to get tens of gold pounds!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After the pass, the owner threw the silver coins back to Mara with a trembling hand. Mara shook her head and forced a silver coin into the owner's hand: "This is just a thank you. If you really want to express your gratitude, it is better to sell me some meat. I think you should have Hide some?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer has a hard color: "Accordingly, how should I sell you to a lady? But it is really gone, not only It’s a cow, not even pigs and chickens.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, if you don’t insist on beef, the old John in the east will have some "Another person inserted in. "Old John is the hunter in the village."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner frowned. "No. Johannes's hut near the hut." I started to have a thick fog last night. I have already said that no one should be close to it. The magic is completely disordered, and the old John is probably a fierce one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The man sat back and slammed, and Mara was interested. She stood up and asked, "From here, along the path to the east of the forest, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner looks a little unhappy: "Ms. As my guest, I must be responsible for your safety. It is very dangerous. It is not worth taking risks for a little meat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daughter of Silver Dragon Laughed: "Maybe it is. But I am also a magician, I know how to ensure my safety. I can see that you have a little bit of magic, and your restaurant has simple defense magic. But they seem to have been ineffective for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before others answered, Mara went straight to the side of a picture hanging on the wall and opened it. The painting reveals the magical array engraved below. She frowned for a moment, raised her finger and pressed the wall panel. The sturdy planks are soft in her hands like cheese, and the wood chips fall like snow. Several gullies were cut open with her fingers, some figures changed shape, and she used the fallen wood chips to fill the unwanted patterns. After all that was over, Mara nodded with satisfaction and prepared a bottle-sized flame arrow in her right hand and squatted on the wall without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people stared at her with a strange look. One such powerful magician appeared in such a rural farm late at night, and everyone felt an ominous atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to borrow a torch." Mara also found that she had done a fire, and opened the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner hesitated and picked up a spare oil lamp from the corner: "I hope this can be useful. There is a small lake in the forest, this small lake Circulated to the riverside of the king, the old Louis cottage is by the lake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mara took the oil lamp and walked out the door. I don't know when, there was a thick fog outside the door, blocking the moonlight. Climate and magic are unpredictable in the magical mudlands south of Jena. She left the farm, followed the country lane, and followed the flow of magic to the east. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer told her that Old Peter’s hunting lodge was in the woods of the road north of the fog. In the depths of the woods, echoing the horror of unknown creatures; the flow of magic is also very suspicious, seems to be tempting someone like her. But Yinlong has no fear. There are no creatures in this world that can make the dragon feel fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mara followed the trail into the woods. She was keenly aware that the magic structure in the vicinity was slightly different. She felt it when she used magic just now. It seems that some wizards are reconstructing the structure that magic should have in the vicinity. In the depths of the woods, there was magic light and fire, and she was put into her eyes through the thick fog, but she could not confuse her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All magic structures point in the same direction. Focusing on a certain point, the magic is organized in an orderly manner. She thought it would be the old John's hut. The hunter may be a hermit, she thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the overlapping branches and shrubs in front of the eyes, Mara drilled out of the woods and suddenly opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw the small lake that the farmer said. Everything around him sinks into the thick fog, only this small lake is strangely crystal clear. The moonlight casts straight down from the lake and is reflected on the lake, causing a silver light; even if there are only a few steps away from the lake, it is thick fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you are not a magician, you know that this is definitely not a natural scenery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mara smelled a strange smell. The scent of this barbecue floated across the lake and rushed into her mind. On the opposite side of the lake, a little shimmer is looming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This fragrance is salt, pepper, cinnamon, and pepper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mala Holding the injured arm and running, it immediately bypassed half of the lake. At the end of the thick fog, it was a seemingly ordinary cottage with a bonfire at the door of the cottage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her footsteps slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silver Dragon does not feel fear, but can feel the pressure. Dragons are races that feed on magic, and they can identify people with great magic. They will involuntarily feel awe in such people, just as human beings are awed by those who have great power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mara can smell the powerful magic that almost overflows. If the rules of magic are confusing, the person in front of the hut should be as dazzling as the bright moon in the stars of the night sky; if the rules of magic are still working as usual, every senior mage from Lenny to DeLand should be able to See the existence of this person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air in the lakeside seems to have a bagpipe sound. In the sound of the bagpipe, Mara saw the master of the magic, the girl who was carefully turning the barbecue. The skewers hang on the campfire and spread the seductive scent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She dresses like a hunter, but at first glance it is not a real hunter. Whether it was the worn-out cloth or the hunting bow, it looked very unfit, and it was impossible to cover up her beautiful and proud figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fake hunter is facing Mara, sitting on a small bench next to the campfire, is roasting. There was a table behind her, and there was a telescope on the table with a variety of papers scattered around it. Mara was not in a hurry to disturb her, but quietly began to look at the paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, these are records of the location and direction of the stars. However, these records are not recorded by the average astrologer, and Mara failed to find any familiar astrological emblems on it. There is no star from a certain constellation to enter a certain constellation icon, and there is no animal formed by the star connection. Of course, there is no such thing as "the position of this constellation proves that a person with a constellation origin will have a peach blossom". These papers are only simple and pure, with only the location points of the stars, position data, and various speculative orbits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Would you like to eat?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beauty of the blonde girl is unforgettable. Mara knows this beautiful face; during the day she just rips a demon with this beautiful face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she first discovered that the owner of this face was so charming. The bright blue eyes are as clear as the blue sky, which is very different from her memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to say that you are the hunter here, then this is the best laugh I have ever heard in 500 years."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mara said as she grabbed the skewers and ate it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I originally wanted to say that I am the daughter of the hunter here." The blonde girl smiled. "But since it is an acquaintance, no, it should be said that it is a cooked dragon. There is no way for this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...oh...I remember...ah..." Mara approached the fire and took care of herself. Holding the skewer and sending it to his mouth, he said while eating, "...you seem to be...ah...it is a lieutenant...ah...what is your purpose...oh?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie Sefer snorted: "I want to eat or talk, choose one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong Did not hesitate to concentrate on eating. Annie smiled and picked up the skewers and ate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the lake, silver light is reflected on the water. One person and one dragon, who stood hostile, were on the side of the fire, rushing to grab the skewers, just as they had not eaten for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Mara began to think that Anne’s string of meat was not enough. She looked around and found the remaining half of the deer in front of the hut, squeezing a happy roar from her throat and rushing over. She raised her right hand and restored the claw tip to the original. The dragon's speed and the power of the dragon made the half-deer clean in a minute. She summoned an invisible servant, letting this hidden magic servant begin to do the troublesome work of signing meat on the sign. After finishing all this, she stretched out and waited for a new round of roasting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just out of curiosity, Mara glanced at the hut with the corner of her eye. This eye made her stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She put down the meat in her hand and went into the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more celestial observations in the house, all bundled, piled up like a hill. Next to this pile of mountain-like materials, there is a narrow, simple bed, just like a bed that an Orion should have. Mara approached the bed and looked at the old man lying on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the owner of the farm said the same, Old Johannes must be an hunter. His slender fingers were full of bows, and the skin was filled with the mark of wind and frost. Mara can also see things that ordinary people can't see, such as this old gentleman is also a magician. There is life in him to prolong the legacy of magic, many organs should have been exhausted, and originally relying on the magical power of magic to continue to work hard; but now that the magic is already chaotic, these depleted organs have become One black hole after another, each of which may end the life of the old man immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mara also saw the only reason why the elderly can still live. A hose passed into the mouth of the old man's dry mouth, and slowly poured into the throat of a large flask with silvery water. The woman of the silver dragon licked a little silver water with her finger, and licked it with her tongue, and then felt a relaxed body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is life water? But where is the life water nearby..." Mara suddenly remembered something, "Don't...? No, it's impossible, It was too exaggerated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman of the silver dragon rushed out the door and rushed to the lakeside, kneeling down and holding a handful of water and drank it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Energement is full of energy, just like waking up. Her hands are filled with silver water, no, this whole lake is full of life water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when, the blonde girl went to the lake and handed Mara a cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not necessary to drink some water by hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is to continue the life of the old gentleman? For the old John, have you turned this whole lake into a life water?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But now in this situation! Do you know how to deal with this magical confusion? How can you create this kind of chaos? Life Spring Water-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silver Dragon slammed into the mouth. He understood that the beautiful girl in front of him was the chief culprit in the magical confusion and nightmare that caused all of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she didn’t say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a war. In a war where you live and die, millions of people put their life on top, and the outcome of each battle is related to the future of the world. In this war that has lasted for nearly a hundred years, there has been no morality to say. Just as she has the responsibility to be there, the female magician opposite is also responsible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you tear up the magical network of a region and destroy the daily life of thousands of ordinary people, you will not hesitate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is you who destroyed the order of magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Mara’s statement, Anne Quietly nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, you ended up using his magic to prolong life and vitality. That complex magic cannot continue in this chaotic order. The old Mr. Johannes has no ability to rebuild such a magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mara continued. Annie nodded again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You also know that life water can only last for one ** three days of life." Mara finally asked this question, "So, why?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this question, there are many layers of meaning hidden; Mara has too many things to know. However, there are some things that do not need to be asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie said after a moment of indulging: "First of all, you can rest assured that this is not my task. It is my personal request that will not harm your majesty." Benefits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course. Your mission has been completed." Mara smiled bitterly. As long as she saw her alone with injuries, the other party would understand that the empire had been defeated in the Northern Line and it was completely defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have something I want to ask you to hand over to a person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems only one Something can satisfy this statement. Mara tentatively asked: "Is those observations?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s good to talk to smart people, no, dragons." Anne from under the table Take out a box, "Not all, but these are the essence of the work of the old Johannes. I want you to pass these manuscripts to the person who came up with a way to fix this mess, Isaac? Newton. This is also where I am. The reason for waiting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mara did not take the call. The daughter of the Silver Dragon took the cup and took another sip of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the last wish of the old gentleman. After being forced to leave the empire because the academic results are not recognized, he is incognito here, prolonging life with magic. I also observed the starry sky for forty years and perfected the remaining observations without magical interference. I have to hand it over to someone who can use them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Mara is a little moved. "So, this person is a great magician-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, he used to be the great magician of the empire. Johannes Kepler, Those who are crowded by your astrology warlocks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mara has a new question: "But why?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne thought about it, lowered her voice, and said her reason in Mara’s ear. After hearing this reason, Yinlong no longer questioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two began to work together to organize the remaining records. They are like a pair of friends who have known each other for many years. They sit by the small lake full of life water, drink tea made from petal, and work together with tacit understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I tell you the reasons for Isaac?" Ma stretched a lazy waist and lifted the box in one hand, ready to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," Annie replied. "Wait a minute, I will report this to the old gentleman."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne walked into the Orion's cabin, reported the results of her actions in the ear of Johannes Kepler, and introduced the people who would inherit his data. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, she came out, and there were tears in the eyes of the sapphire-like eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From beginning to end, Mara has never had any thoughts of fighting. She still remembers the process of fighting the incarnation of the demon yesterday; it is obviously not enough to fight against the person who can summon this demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She only hopes that she will not fight alone with this terrible girl in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way back to the farm, the daughter of Silver Dragon has been thinking so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horseshoes are flying, crossing the hills and fields. The silver-clad Guards of the Cavalry rushed into the ramp of the dawn and rushed into the quietly farm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are searching for enemy mage! Repeat it! We are searching for enemy mage!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The cavalry repeated the orders aloud, cutting down the militia who tried to stop them and rushed into the farm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People! As long as you hand over all those without proof of identity, you can get safe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The cavalry officers headed by them and their mages jumped off Malay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer looked at the four-pointed skeptical gaze and turned to the young and majestic mage, sympathetically asking: "Sir Newton, here is what you are looking for "Where is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should not be far away. I can start the next restoration work from here. Soon from here to the last point of Sanli Magic can be used between the two," answered the young and majestic mage Sir Isaac Newton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to save this army, the 23-year-old Sir Isaac Newton was summoned to the expeditionary staff. He stayed up all night and proposed a set of methods to rebuild the magical structure of the muddy area to support the troops' continued march. He wrote this method on the booklet and handed it to the army's army mages to let them rebuild the magical order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Anne Sefer, who caused this magical mire, was fortunate enough to see this thin booklet, she would find it would be that famous The prototype of the core chapter in The Principles of Natural Philosophy. That book will unify the complex magic theory from a more fundamental level, paving the way for future magic development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called magic is a very magical thing. People have discovered from a long time that magic is a science, it can be repeated; but magic is a mystery, it is complex and changeable. Arcane is magic, magic is magic, alchemy is magic, astrology is magic, Confucianism is magic, and yellow towel is magic. There are also a large number of magical creatures that naturally exist and are not affected by these magical theories. This problem has plagued generations of sages and magic scientists, letting them rack their brains and gain nothing, until Newton wrote "The Principles of Natural Philosophy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is a metaphor, it is more like geometry. Euclidean invented the first geometric logic system based on a huge system of five axioms; but if you replace the fifth one in this axiom, you can derive more completely different geometries. Euclid has geometry, and Robachevsky and Riemann can of course have geometry. The same is true of the science of deciding magic. It is the study of public relations. As long as a magic theory can be self-explanatory, new logic and different reality will be produced, and a new magic system will be produced. People and magical creatures can approach the source through a variety of magical theories, but in the end, "only beliefs determine power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cavalry officer certainly does not understand this. He looked in awe at the busy wizard, and with his own guards retired: "Then we went to work, adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the restaurant were flustered on their faces. The farmer had an iron sand gun on his hand, which was the favorite model of the gun hunters, and his hand was pressed on the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have provided a lot of assistance to your army! You better understand this-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "We are searching for a woman," the headed officer rudely interrupted the master's protest. "A woman who has been injured. She is a very powerful magician, may not be a woman, or hides a wound; But you should be able to see that she is different from the average person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who are sleepy have a timid look at each other, this little action has not escaped the eyes of the officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, you know. A beautiful female mage who has been seriously injured, trying to cover up her scars. She has been here."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the farmer remains calm: "Is she a criminal? Can I ask, what did she do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon hearing this question, the cavalry officer’s lips were distorted. His fingers turned blue-purple due to congestion, holding the hilt tightly, as if "the woman" was waiting for him to kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is a demon inhabiting this neighborhood. It is the common enemy of your southerners and our northerners! The demon is extremely brutal and has no evil. She has destroyed countless The country and town, so many of our great magicians and pastors have been turned into bodies! Twenty-seven transport teams were brutally destroyed, and all the dead were burned to ashes! We have lost a court Magician, seven gold and silver emblems, two chief bishops, three bishops, thirty-nine officers and officers! God fortunately we have heroic warriors, wise magicians and wicked priests who fight together and finally In the afternoon yesterday, this female demon who fell into the trap was hit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, later?" The farmer seems to have also come in interest, "You have won ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cavalry officer continued to gnash his teeth: "However, the power of this female demon is too amazing, she uses all sorts of strange evil magic to escape the encirclement, Also blood washed two small towns to restore her evil Ability. We shot through her left chest and right abdomen in the pursuit, melted her left arm with high heat, and cut off her half-foot! After that we lost her trace, and later four The chase team lost contact. In order to completely eliminate the common threat of all of us, you quickly tell me where she is going, as long as she can seize her, the emperor will have a reward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The farmer is silent. Someone around wanted to talk, but he was glanced at by the owner and had to squat back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer was a little impatient: "Enough, I know she has been here. I just want to know where she went - she won't be here." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer seems to have been shocked: "No, no, of course not! You can look at the oil painting on the wall, she did come, She also helped us fix the old magic array, this magic array can be fireproof..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several soldiers looked at each other and nodded. Instead of asking the busy Newton, they went straight to the painting, pulled the painting off the wall, and began to study the magic array behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a trap?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe, don't be too Hurry. Master, she said that she didn't stay? We want to search your house, don't you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer looks a little embarrassed: "Can you wait any longer? My wife and they haven't got up yet. Besides, I don't want to harbor such a demon, unless she disguised as someone else, or she disguised herself as a wicked freedom--rebel tax "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer thought for a moment and replied: "It is unlikely that people who pretend to be us will be disguised as free-agents. But anyway She is also a demon, not a member of the Free Army-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But when I sound, she is a hero of the Free Army."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer whispered, suddenly picked up the iron sand gun in his hand and fired a shot at the soldiers gathered next to the magic array.The officer who was glad that he had smashed the gun and screamed, and the whole person was stuck on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mara returned from the box full of information, the battle was over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire farm is turned into a rubble. Except for the farmhouse that she had reinforced with the fire magic array, all the remaining buildings were burnt to ashes. Men and militiamen died in the yard, in the grass, in the stables, on the wall, in the mill, at the well. The bodies of the women and the children were piled up in a pile, thrown in the empty field of the farmland, next to the bodies of the dead emperors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers with spears and muskets were searching in the yard, and when they saw her coming in, they all exclaimed and started to fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that moment, the silver dragon named Mara forgot his own transformation, and the left wing of his own reflexion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should not be the army she fought for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She screamed and started using the instinct to start the battle. Her right hand became a claw, her legs broke through the trousers, and only the body barely maintained the human form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of fighting is very fast and quickly until she has forgotten. When she came back, all the weapons were inserted in the wall of the yard, and the shivering soldiers were trying to climb and escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mara grabbed a soldier and asked, "Why are you killing them? Why do you want to kill even children and women?!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daughter of Silver Dragon is squeezing these words out of the blind. Because of anger, she is not able to control the human muscles she imitates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers struggled and replied: "This is the war...they attacked first, I am executing the order-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mara's claws run through the soldier's throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, there is no right or wrong in a brutal war. Everyone is only loyal to their duties and beliefs. Everyone will say this. Many people are I feel that cruelty is the essence of war, so they abuse this power arbitrarily. They also think that it is naive and stupid to not use this cruel person. You envy and worship cruel people."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the silver dragon girl is louder, she uses the natural magic ability of the silver dragon family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to discern every trembling in the voice reveals every lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, tell me, soldiers, are you involved in killing these people? Tell me, is the answer yes, or not?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malali landed every person who started the massacre. In fact, only one person did not start the slaughter, that is the young magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, I didn't kill... I am Isaac? Newton... I, I will pay the ransom... Don't kill me..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isaac? Newton’s legs are soft and sit down on the ground. He is a senior mage, that's right; but the brutal killing of this silver-haired woman in front of him also scared him. He knows that this woman is not the beautiful opponent of yesterday. He can remain calm when fighting the mysterious beauty mage; but the young Mithril wizard is not as experienced as his uncle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This name recalls Mara’s reason. She remembered the prayer she accepted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you here, Isaac?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I detect There is an abnormal magical normal zone near here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mara sighs. Anne Sefer's calculations are so precise that she should have been able to lead Newton himself. If that is the case, perhaps this tragedy will not happen...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she thinks so, the horseshoe is once again calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second empire cavalry received a warning signal that did not know when it came out and rushed into the farm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My entire advance team... Are you chasing this woman?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Mara snorted and turned around and raised the right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the cavalry captain’s attack did not start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't attack, this is an unfortunate misunderstanding. She is not the target, although I don't know why she is here." The responsible person in charge of chasing Cardinal Ionette Hartman turned his weapon into a hand shield and knocked heavily on the head of the captain to stop the intensification of the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me introduce the fangs and claws of our emperor. This is Ms. Silver Dragon Mara. Salute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the cavalry gnashed their teeth. They can't resist a cardinal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionite smiled bitterly: "Although I don't know the specific process, I can probably guess the reason. This Ms. Mara executed the military law for us." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just performed a tragedy," Mara whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The cause of the tragedy is that we are chasing a terrible enemy, which ignited the anger of all of us," Ionite explained. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He introduced Mara to the current situation and the mysterious female mage they are chasing. Knowing that this wizard had blocked the whole army for so many days, even the daughter of the Silver Dragon was a little surprised; she quickly thought of the suspect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition, I want to thank you for letting go of our reckless little Isaac." After the introduction, Ionite whispered on behalf of the Holy See. Thanks, "Jet? Newton Cardinal's Spirit of Heaven will thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking, I might have killed this young man who is not sensible. But the people you are chasing stopped her in advance with her language. Yes, I saw your hunt last night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disregarding the surroundings Surprised by everyone, Marapin lifted the carton that compressed a large number of paper rolls, released his hand, and the carton slammed into the ground, igniting the dust of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She has something for me to bring to you, Sir Isaac? Newton. She also has some words to convey to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's Anne's interesting "reasons." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She said that the law of nature is hidden in the darkness. The god of destiny says 'you must have Newton', so you have light."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is a great light, she can't go out, so she deliberately saved the last data of Mr. Kepler and gave it to you who studied gravity."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mara recalled those words and retelled them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The thrown stones will eventually land, and the outbreak of war will end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" A cruel war should not obscure the light that belongs to mankind. Because that is the future, the future for which each of us fights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver Dragon glances coldly All the rest of the people. No one dared to look at her, and everyone bowed their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although you didn't do it, there is no glory. This is war, but there should be light in the war. You can't catch up with that person." Ms., never possible. Bye-bye, I am going to report the situation in the north to the headquarters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mara smiles and pulls over an ownerless Horse, riding up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling her breath, the fierce horse became tamed. She smiled smugly, revealing her four big dragon teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These young imperial mages did not lie, they did hit the horrible opponent. Of course, this should have something to do with the tearing of the mimetic demon yesterday. Even Silver Dragon will be proud of this powerful opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
