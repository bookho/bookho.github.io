			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A golden steel needle points directly at the sky. That was originally the right arm of the Golden Golem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golem fell in front of the white priests, and the upper body was almost completely melted by the high heat brought by the lightning. The original subtle structure no longer exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression on its "face" is wonderful now: it looks like a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white man looked at his results, but he could not reveal a smile of victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t show a smile anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his chest, he stayed on the left arm of the golden golem that had become a needle, and it did not penetrate the heart mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that doesn't mean it can't bring death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"powertransmute! Change the shape!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Heavenly Taoist priests At the same time, Reza finally found the right spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembers when she was in New Delhi, she saw a man flying a kite in a thunderstorm. The kite has a metal wire that successfully led the thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person seems to be Benjamin; Linker is rich... but that doesn't matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important thing is that the right arm of the Golem becomes a gold needle, pointing to the sky; and the left arm of the Golem is hitting the other person - can wear Transparency, relative to the lethality of the thunder, can be ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sacrificed the magic of the shape, sacrificed the right arm of the Golden Golem, and turned it into a metal line pointing straight to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge thunderstorm hit, destroying the golem along the metal needle, and destroying the white man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that can defeat Tianlei is Tianlei itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white thunder attracted by the white people, so they destroyed themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows what he was thinking before he died - about thinking that he has won? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he fell, the flag of the dwarf began to scatter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain is getting smaller, the gun array is beginning to gradually disintegrate, and the barbarian screams the slogan "Revenge for the Grand Chief". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outcome of this battle has already been decided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tosca triumphed, but lost the commander, and the dwarf lost his allies and lost the opportunity to acquire the entire eastern land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hatred of both sides will continue and be passed down from generation to generation. The tribe will be unified, the dwarves will still be threatened, and the fighting between the two sides will continue year after year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the invaders of the East and the West mastered the continent and began to enslave all "lower races". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several tribes stalked the priests and ran to their leaders, trying to save his life--but with the sad level of magical civilization, they don’t have this ability. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advanced healing magic has been a big problem since ancient times. Even in the seventeenth century, even the highest church of the Orthodox Church of Koman, only relying on the power of the most devout faith, can complete the magic of "heal" and "resurrect". As for the Protestantism who advocated "toring his own beliefs" to use "inner magic", even "complete treatment" has not yet been overcome, and the progress in the magical technique is obviously behind the Orthodoxy. The epoch-making book "The Principles of Divine Magic" will not begin writing until more than a decade later; and the development of extensive healing and protective magic in accordance with this work is a matter of many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leisha; Hermont went to the red wind, he is already out of gas, less air intake. The alchemist took a bottle of healing potion from his arms and handed it to the nearby Shaman priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This can temporarily relieve the pain, but whether it can be completely restored depends on his own will to survive."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light blue therapeutic potion quietly flows into the esophagus, and the once mighty chieftain trembled a few times and opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are we... won?" The first thing he did after he woke up was to ask the question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shaman licked in his ear and said a few words, a red smile on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the past 20 years, the dwarves should not dare to come again? So I can build a unified Tosca country..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around, including Leisha, quietly removed their gaze. Everyone pretended to have a blood hole that didn't see his belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be something that is perceived from the surrounding atmosphere, and the bold Tosca chief sat up hard and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The pure gold alchemist, tell me, am I not already okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; Reza nodded silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red wind slammed and laughed: "Although I can't see it, I know that you must have nodded. White is like this, never Frankly. One day, the land of our Tosca will be occupied by you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few shamans around the face changed a lot, and they retreated a few times. Step, surround the lace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, don't be embarrassed, this respectable lady, what I promised to give her, must be cashed, and escorted her back to the beach. I It’s about treacherous people in whites, those who have only money in their heads...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing here, the alchemist is red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red wind paused and continued: "...If, if I can’t get through, write down my words and tell the tribes. Don’t be with God. The messenger battle...the slavery is always much better than the annihilation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing that this is a total violation of the honor and the ancestral testament, the shamans are full of faces. Surprised; but out of respect for the great chief, they whispered his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Enter their civilization, learn their power. Be part of their society, remember the glory of the Tosca..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the red wind is getting smaller and smaller, and it is getting worse. There is pain in the lungs, and perhaps the effectiveness of the healing potion has passed. Rainwater flows into the eyelids, and everything in the field of vision becomes blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, I am here, will it be better than the country where I founded the Tosca? The storm is like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought so, closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resident...the hero of the Tosca."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alchemist will quiet Rest on your chest and say goodbye to someone who knows only one week. In the deepest part of her heart, there is a voice that seems to be laughing at it. Laughing at everyone including her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is thinking of a glorious pioneer, or a mysterious alien magician, everyone is doing the same business. This business is based on the breadth of those indigenous peoples, and this vast land is used as a market, and it is repeated here. Good-hearted people from different countries taught them tactics, sold them weapons, angered the slogans against other tribal atrocities, and even personally helped them fight. Those who participated in the war thought that they were fighting for honor and tribe, but they did not know that only the exotic talents who watched sneer were the real winners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One person saw it, but he died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Back to New Denia, you have to recast the Golden Golem, don't know how much it will cost..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, the tribe's elders Give the good reward to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although the Red Wind is no longer, our Tosca people will fulfill their promises. These are good rewards, 15,000 furs. Because of you The guards have been sacrificed or left, we will send the best warriors in the tribe to protect you to the east."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Laila looked Looking at the whole ten car fur, it is really good. Barbarians do business, it is real, not adulterated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are half of the spoils that the Red Wind lord once promised... According to our custom, it should be attributed to the combatants..." The elders’ faces are difficult . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I only need all the relics of the White Master. That person is defeated by me, can you give it to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, ah, of course." The elder laughed again - anyway, the Tosca would not use magic items. "Those things, we have all sorted out, just waiting for you to come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old-fashioned guy has long anticipated my reaction? It’s time to take back what they said just now...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza thought so, and the elders went to another tent. Those blood-stained things, lying quietly under the burnt white coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's these."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza counted. A few yellow paper scrolls with strange symbols, a cracked red sword, a dark, loose white gown with strange bars. There is also a seemingly strange mirror - it was actually polished with copper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there only these things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only these are."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the limited relics, the alchemist could not help but give birth to some emotions. The great magician of a foreign country, so unclear and buried here, did not leave a last word. She didn't know how many years it took to create the magic that led to the thunder. She only knew that she might not be able to study this magic in her life. She also feels a little scared: even if it is only a little bit, his life will be confessed here. For the first time, she felt that it was not enough to defend herself with a magical figure--that is only a magical item after all, not a living person who can rely on peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She started checking those things. Unknown scrolls, certainly not dare to use. Every wizard knows that the use of reels may be dead, go back to the old continent and ask for advice. The red sword, which looks like a crack, should be a magic item - or it can't be identified. Even if the clothes were originally enchanted, they are definitely damaged now. She turned her eyes to the last thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噢?是面铜镜?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alchemist feels a bit strange. Since the mercury mirror method invented by the opticians of Audi, the bronze mirror has been on the verge of elimination, and it is not easy to see in the civilized world. Perhaps, the foreign country has not invented the mercury mirror method? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some equally strange symbols engraved around the bronze mirror. Maybe a kind of text? In short, she has never seen this kind of text. Because you don't know, you can't identify it. Only some spots can be identified, some are dark and some are bright. At the center of the bronze mirror, there is a light spot that is lit. Turn the dial around and the distance and size of the spot will change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?... Well, it’s better to take a look at it with a test. Bronze mirror, bronze mirror, who is the most beautiful in the world. Woman?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No response. Of course, no response. Of course, there is no response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "True trouble... What the hell is this?" She thought about taking it into her bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that era, the magical detection technique of the East was higher than that of the West. They use bronze mirrors as detection supplies, which is equivalent to "dete", which is the effect of magic detection. When the Comans got the detective magic synthesis technique from the Far East and invented the same product, it was already in the middle of the 18th century - but that was a story that had nothing to do with the story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance from the Tosca Prairie to the new Koman colonies is 800 kilometers in the current unit; the distance from the east coast of the New World to the Old World is 3,500 nautical miles. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two hundred and fifty years, it took only six hours to get from Toscaville to the East Coast Economic Center in Port Vailon. In the case of an airship, it is only 36 hours to the neutral city of DeLand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the seventeenth century, it took half a month to drive the carriage from Tosca Prairie to New Delhi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the calendar turns to May, the road under the wheel gradually turns into a dirt road, and the low wooden fence of New Derania appears in her In the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She returned to the port of New Delhi, the center of the new Coleman colony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Delhi is the fourth colony on the New World and the first colony to be exploited by humans. Today, its history has been 150 years. In the past 150 years, the low-ranking people of the Old World, like ants, flocked to the continent where milk and honey flowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explorers who want to explore the new world, religious persecutors, magicians who practice dark magic, prisoners sentenced to exile, but low status The desperate to be famous, the underworld boss who is chasing after the enemy, the bankrupt who owes the debt of the ass, the speculative businessman who is full of the concept of profit without risk, and the chief of the revenge of the three enemies The abandonment of the dark family fled to the ground, the double knives, the gnomes who decided to reach the New World to destroy the mysterious magic ring, the works are too bad to find the inspiration, only the authors of the novels... all kinds of people rushed to No, it flocked to the mainland of Xinzhou. This trend from the Old World to the New World, over 3,500 nautical miles, appeared in the 16th century free war, and reached another in the 17th century. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this ** is related to the ongoing civil war in Koman, the persecution of the minority by both the North and the South, and the discovery of the gold and silver mines in the New World. Now, there are only 500,000 people in New Coman. There are another 800,000 humans and elves in the colonies of other forces in Beixinzhou. The Nanxinzhou and Chaujian Islands controlled by the elves also reached a total population of one million. Although the territory controlled by the so-called "civilized world" is only 25 percent of the total area of ​​the north and south, and the population is only 40 percent of the indigenous population, their expansion is unstoppable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commonly, people who came to Xinzhou from the 15th to the early 16th century were called "discoverers" and people who arrived in Xinzhou in the 16th century called "exploration." "The people who came to this continent in the 17th century are called "blazers." Here is a piece of land that is free to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the central port of the New World, New Delhi has a population of about 20,000, which is no worse than any medium-sized city in the Old World. It has neo-classical architecture, beautiful and tidy coastal carriageways, a variety of shops, and a prestigious dock – and of course, many mages, priests and alchemists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In New Denia, she sold a thousand thousand furs at a good price--seeing the thirty or forty fierce barbarians around her People, the price will not be bad. With this money, she found a mage here, rented a small laboratory to work for two months, and repaired the Golden Devil like a dummy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also went to Lin Kelanfu, but learned that the person who flew a kite in the thunderstorm has returned to the Old World, seems to be serving as the home country of the New World. Communication representative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life goes on like this day...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the butterfly always quietly waves it Wings, no one can predict changes in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day in mid-June, she came to the port to hang out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Speaking of it, there is an elf-armed merchant ship called 'Kleon Emperor' that has just been built in the harbor and seems to be hiring a ship master and The pastor's. As long as the test passes, there is a high reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it not the elf's ship that should have the ship's mage and pastor? What happened? "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am afraid that the vessel that levied taxes wants to strengthen prevention?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been in the New World for three years, and the life of the pioneers is enough. How can magic be strong? So strong, strong to the Master who can be manipulated even the thunder, is not the same as dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on... go back?" The thought suddenly slid across the heart of Reza. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to his hometown, paying off his debts, opening an alchemy shop, and living a life without a fight. Usually raise the magic beast, create a magical dummy warrior, go out and hunt for treasure, how good life...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money should be enough? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just open a small shop, Er, the name is 'Alchemist Lori' just fine... then find a handsome guy..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought so, looked at the sky in the east and made up her mind. She walked to the hotel to find out when the ship was sailing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said that "the hotel is the beginning of all legendary stories." Although it is somewhat biased, it seems to be too old-fashioned in modern times, but it is the truth before modern times. Only the hotel's spirits, stoves and beauty can attract the protagonists of those legends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The returning sailor sat at the table and drank a strong tequila. The businessman who stopped here shrank in the corner and mixed with soda. The light beer, waiting in front of the bar to soothe the scarred heart of the men, the women drink light cocktails made with blue citrus wine; the owner of the hotel squats on the bar, leisurely staring at the door, let the handyman To greet the guests. The bar during the summer day is not too busy, only a few sailors hiding in the cold and lazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it here?" Some high-pitched female voices were uploaded from the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bang, the two loose-leaf doors were knocked open, and a huge, burly figure appeared at the door of the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bar owner was suddenly awakened from the semi-sleepy state and stared there with the rest of the bar. The golden light flashed there, and the direct flash was dazzling--it was a big man wearing a golden armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the price..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no 'Kleon Emperor' Crew?! The owner of the voice, the woman who was dressed in gold on the body, flashed from behind the golden plaque. "The Emperor of the Cleón, stand up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner, a sailor stood up in a reflexive manner. The woman saw him stand up and walked toward him with the big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailor looks at this golden light shining young woman Looking at the super-shaped big man, he nodded with fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your ship, are you recruiting magicians and pastors?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah... ...yes, yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to go to the boat for face-to-face testing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ah... yes, yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you get to your ship?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah... yes, yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman frowned. "Don't be singular! Let's take the road to your boat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...Yes, yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailor hurriedly stood up and took the two people out. The rest of the people in the bar are all speechless and can't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this woman and the big man?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know... In this way, is it two Masters? Or a Warrior Adder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
