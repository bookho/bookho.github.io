			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xvi<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the construction of the temporary camp, you can see the Emperor and the Free Army The magical power has a serious generation difference. Also a temporary camp that was built less than two months ago, the Bluestone Cement Fortress of the Imperial Volunteer looks much stronger than the Warrior's Fortress and Soldier's Quarter. Not only do they have a sophisticated remote detection system, but even a two-meter-high solid trapezoidal wall is embedded with a simple protective array of cheap magic paint. This kind of array is not used for physical protection, but to make the city wall more difficult to collapse and crack, and will not let the concrete pieces hurt the people who defend on the wall. The magical technology gap between the North and the South is not just the essential gap in advanced magic. The gap between these low-level magic skills is even greater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this campsite called Fortress, Nanimen felt that the possibility of his plan’s success seemed to be a little lower. But the soldiers can't wait until they have 100% confidence to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperors who came to the south are almost all so-called "elite", the total number is very limited, and the estimate of staying in the reserve team will not exceed five. Hundreds of people; in contrast, now there are more than 1,500 troops in the hands of Guangnai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the sincere request of the Lieutenant Saphir, nine of the twelve companies entering the city are willing to obey the command of his troubled officer, only three I have to go back to support the division. Considering that this can attract the attention of the emperor, Nanimen did not insist that she should bring everyone. Now, the rest of the company is left in the fortification of the tower. Waiting for the signal of the assault company; only the assault is connected to itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath, pulled out his black revolver and checked the bullets in each barrel. This has no practical meaning, but it can calm his mood. He re-examined his team and confirmed that all the flags would not reveal his identity and gave orders to his adjutant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, Annie. Act according to plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, Soledon Lieutenant." Annie still answered politely as usual. Naimen often felt that she was too polite: she never called his name. However, no matter how he reminded, this girl with rough nerves could not change, and he had to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He coughed and slammed his face and walked with Anne at the forefront of the team. As they approached the fortress, probably a class of defenders had rushed out to wait in front of the fortress to "greet" them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is your army doing?" asked an imperial man in charge of the Coman language with an empire accent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We belong to the Matterish Division Itis; the majesty of Major Magnum, is coming for help!" Anne has already prepared the draft The answer is, "The number of enemies in the South is quite amazing. They have concentrated nearly 30 companies trying to interfere with our army's actions!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thirty company! This is More than 70% of their strength!" The soldier exclaimed, turned and ran to report. Naimen noticed that he was well aware of the strength of the warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a harsh military sound came from the tower of the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enemy! Enemy!" More than one surveillance mage has observed the enemies that are approaching. "There are about ten company, the flag of the trench, is the south." Army!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten company!" The team that heard the news was shocked. "It seems that we have no time to reinforce them! We only have a total of Two companies, please go to the camp to ensure safety!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can it be so good? Is it against the agreement?" . He heard that the other side had only two companies, and his confidence was a lot bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things have been so urgent, please hurry up!" the squad leader urged. Resist the door no longer, and immediately ordered the entire assault to follow the other party into the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this Coman Volunteer Army is almost an outstanding aristocratic officer, and soon some people feel that something is wrong. When the team passed the main entrance of the camp, a knight in the gate of the city suddenly asked: "Wait a minute. Can you inform your number, name and class?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Mattby Xi Shi? Does the division have three assaults?" The knight’s tone was in doubt, and he looked down at the information he had seen in the past few days. "How have I not heard of..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His memories have not continued. Taking advantage of his chance to blaspheme, the doorman quickly took out his pistol and almost pulled the trigger against his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harsh gunshot sounded and the bullets ran through his chest. The officer had a sly look on his face and fell against the wall. There was a slight feeling of inability to endure the door, but the current situation has no time to be sentimental to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to win all the shots!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie did not hesitate to use Magic, through the dexterous movements in the middle of the small team of soldiers, with a close magic and fighting skills to knock them down one by one. The commanders of each class lined up with bayonets and rushed to key positions at their own discretion. The entire assault was like a sharp knife, and it immediately cut off the contact between the various departments of the Imperial Reserve. Even with perfect external defense, the camp of the emperor has almost no preparation for street fighting: perhaps in the eyes of the designers, the fortress that has been broken does not have the value of continuing to guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the battle is faster than the Freedom Army officers imagined. The defenders simply did not expect such a force to rush when the city was in chaos, and the organized resistance did not last long. About seven or eight mages and priests, with a guard line, organized an unsuccessful but fierce defense near the headquarters. Almost all of them were killed or seriously injured, and they had lost almost two classes of troops. When these people also lost their fighting power, no one resisted anymore. When the follow-up brigade rushed in, only the finishing work was left in the entire camp. The commanders each took their own merits, and the door-to-door walked into the staff of the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The troops staying here are too weak. The middle-level mages and the priest-level people only see two or three, and the senior aristocrats and officers are one. No. It’s all about the class and my little staff... I really want to thank the division for taking the enemy away.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a dozen dejected The Emperor's staff passed by him, and several soldiers responsible for it saluted him. He nodded and walked into the enemy's staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall here is like a staff department in Kengler’s city map, and it’s strange and incomprehensible. Mark. The door was a bitter smile, sitting down on the leather swivel chair that should have belonged to the chief staff of the emperor. After sitting for a while, he stood up again and sat down in the chair of the commander of the emperor, examining this huge round table and the scattered documents on it. There were a few piles of ashes, and it was obvious that they had temporarily destroyed a lot of documents...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt a little bit wrong, slammed the table and bounced from the chair After three steps back. A dagger with a head is nailed to his lap, and the blood flow is like a note. According to the position of the dagger, if he is a little more accurate, he will suffer a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is it?! Come out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no pain, facing the table Sighed and screamed. Anne and several soldiers heard his roar and rushed into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They thought they would see an imperial soldier with a high rank - but in fact, the name that was drilled from under the table was wearing a blue low Young brunette female in bust gown. She raised her hands high and bit her lip, and her chin was deliberately high. Just glanced at his face, she turned her head disdainfully, looking at the ceiling. Naimen felt that her looks were familiar, but she did not expect that she actually had a number of faces with the woman a few months ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Dear Pastor, can you tell me your name and identity?" Annie rushed in and saw Raiff’s familiar face, the same. A bit. She also couldn't remember the female pastor who had seen the brunette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Riv; Namlock." The sister of the Holy Emperor replied proudly, "Legend the pastor."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, you have chosen the priest from the houses of the Imperial nobles. There should be a lot of scrolls to set up the anti-magic array, and erect in all the captive houses. You can fix the password." Resist the door and pull out the dagger, and it was hard to make a sound, and he washed the wound with a therapeutic syrup to stop bleeding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand." Anne turned to leave, and the doorman quickly screamed at the adjutant who sometimes had less ribs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and she did not expect that this seemingly ordinary female prisoner would bring much trouble to them and Yanika. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, is the front line leader of the South Army a bold guy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It was a subordinate of my time in Fort Worth, a small person." Itis uneasily stroked the symbol on the table with no meaning. "He later re-entered Lenny and got a staff job." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small characters! Little people, can you let him pick up all the politicians, then take our camp, and finally take the princess as a hostage?! At the cost, we have only seized one member of the republic of the Republic. There are at least two hundred of them. They are killed and can choose another two hundred. There is only one of the royal ladies! The best agent of the empire in the South. The youngest professor in the history of the Higher Arcane Academy, the holy knight of the Guardian Knights, and one of the twelve cardinals who master the highest power of the Holy See... How many outstanding talents can make such mistakes! If you give all the command authority to the Royal Security Department, This will not happen! I will not miss anything in the final report!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speaker took a breath and picked it up from the table Fine porcelain teacup, drink a cup of tea and moisturize the scorpion. Those who were able to attend this occasion were the elites of the Holy Coman Empire deployed in the South. When they heard this reprimand, everyone’s face was not quite right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...If now that Lord Sid has arrived here, he will say this. What do you think? This passage is passed to the Minister of Military Affairs, we All have to go to the frozen plains to hunt snowmen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frazor, who is currently the commander of the Imperial Volunteers; Rasta pressed his hands on the table and looked around. In addition to Parker, who is directly affiliated with the Royal Security Department, is performing special missions near Lenny, and all the people who know Olia; Hugh; Coman's whereabouts are here to explore countermeasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, it’s my responsibility." Agent Isis, codenamed "Fog Eagle"; Magnum stood up and apologized, "I didn't give Jenny." The card conveys the correct order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you say responsibility, I am more responsible for defending the Guardian Knight who is responsible for defending His Highness. Now it is not accountable. At that time, the key question was how to save His Highness before Sid’s appearance.” Xiu Lan; Di Mattel seems to be the most anxious one. “There is only one way.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With us surpassing their combat power, we can directly take down my Highness. It can only be like this." It looks like an ordinary uncle's Jeter; Newton Cardinal took over the topic, "We can completely attack and destroy Drop the other's command system - or, at least save the Lord Olia."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This action will be handed over to me and Jeter." Isaac Newton helped the glasses, "All the other people here have a magical power that probably won't catch up with us. That's it? We are divided into two ways, all the way to lead the defenders, and the other way directly to save the temple. This matter must be kept secret, no one knows that the Princess is here, and now no one can let anyone know the princess The temple fell into the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone nodded, and no one wanted to leave this matter until the arrival of Security Minister Sid. Of course, no one is sure that he would not know what happened here - almost every Koman heard the name would be scalp, and no one would underestimate his ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is coming, the camp’s retaining wall casts a long shadow on the ground, and the flag of more than ten faces is low. The temperature gradually decreased, and the blue army coats were white, carrying guns and walking around, warning every entrance to the camp, ready to meet the counterattacks that may come at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the emperor and the governor’s army did not respond to the fighting here throughout the day, just as they did not realize this thing. of. The officers with the ability to cast spells are all busy, searching for resources that can be used in the fortress of this magical advanced country: they remove the hidden dangerous magic, draw sketches of the entire camp, mark the terrain and traps that can be used, try Turn it into your own fortifications at the fastest speed. Anne was busy all afternoon to arrange the defense zones of the company, to lure, seduce, persuade, and intimidate the proud eunuchs. Soleton’s resume is difficult to convince, but in the case that such an enemy may be overwhelmed at any time, everyone feels that there is still a willingness to take over the chore – or to be able to use it as a shield to be sacrificed. Well, he temporarily recognized his status as an interim commander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening wind brought the sound of the organ, which was the young lady of the Crosso Brothers Bank who was practicing the piano skills. In this camp, there is actually a very decent Orthodox church. The organ inside has little performance but it is good: less than one hundred years of division is not enough to make the difference between the instruments of the North and the South. Naimeng followed the long, sad organ of the organ and found the past. He found that the officers and soldiers who had nothing to do after eating had been packed with churches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed and dismissed the idea of ​​squeezing into the crowd to watch the performance, bypassing the church. Behind the church is a temporary cemetery where the body is parked. The soldiers of both sides who died during the daytime operations are temporarily placed here, waiting to be buried. In the daytime operations, the assault even lost nearly 20 soldiers. Their coffins were piled up in four rows, neatly stacked in the open air; the seesaw was thrown aside, and the Imperial iron coat was not painted. . The dead of the emperor is twice this number. The coffins of these people are already occupied, and the body can only be wrapped with white cloth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather in early spring is still very cold, the body has not rotted, and there is no smell of nausea. The door was circumvented by the heavy coffins, but found that her female adjutant stood behind the coffin. He didn't expect to see her in such a remote place. He stumbled and hesitated what kind of wording to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, it’s hard work in the afternoon. Then, are you mourning the victims? These people have familiar things...?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is of course. But I am not mourning them." His adjutant turned his head and his face was filled with a different calm smile on Peace Day. Now she looks like another person. "If you want to mourn everyone who died because of me, I can't do anything. To be honest, I just look at the stars here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen To this unexpected answer, the resistance door was mixed. "Stars? What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you believe in astrology?" Annie looked up at the starry sky. "That is to use the position of the stars to predict the world, life. The doctrine of success or failure. They said that the actions of the big men are related to the movement of the stars, and the movement along the stars can be smoother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Astrology? Are you an astrologist?" Resentfully laughed out. "Is it superstitious? Stars are a moving world. The light from these stars is projected on our rotating planet, which constitutes the so-called Celestial. This kind of thing looks different in every corner of the world. How can you decide the success or failure? Everyone who uses magic should know the work of the great magician Galileo and Kepler of the last century. Well, only the imperial nobles who don’t learn nothing can believe in astrology.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny gently shook his head: “Astrology does have no theory. Basis, but the world believes that astrology also has its You don’t think that the stars are working like life is unpredictable? Do you know how long it takes for the stars to project on our scorpio, Sorelton?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Namimen recalled the books he had read before and replied: "The world of stars is very far away from us, for a few months to a few years."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The far more than the vast majority of the stars that flash in this sky, it takes hundreds or even tens of thousands of years to reach our world. The stars we see now, at least Stars hundreds of thousands of years ago. They emit light and spend thousands of years just to let us see it here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Can't say that." Naomi raised an objection. "These lights should have been sent out. It's just that we happen to see it here. They are not emitting light for us to see..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly understood the metaphor in Annie's words. The bodies in front of him have gone through decades of life, with their own lives and rich memories. They must also have family members, parents, friends, lovers, hard training, great ambitions or amazing ambitions. But in the end, like the light of hundreds of years ago, they reached the end and burned together. The purpose of their birth is also not dead here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne kneels next to a body wrapped in white cloth and gently draws a magic symbol on it with his fingertips. "They can't even be considered a meteor in the sky, because the meteors are burning themselves, and they just quietly and ordinaryly shine in the night sky, no one pays attention, no one cares until they are drowned by history. So, I won't mourn. The dead. You can only mourn the people you know. It is unfair to all the people who have changed their fate because of me. These emperors also have their own lives."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
