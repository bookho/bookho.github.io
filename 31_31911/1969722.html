This is the first general battle to determine the future destiny of the world after the Magic Net was built. More than 10,000 magical users involved in the war and neutral, more than 1,000 left the relevant original records. Their magic spans a dozen different magic schools, from the most orthodox arcane, magic, martial arts, to shaman witchcraft, yin and yang, all of which are involved, from their own perspectives to observe this huge battle. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every battlefield, every battle, there is a record with the army mages, other magic net users from all parties in order to understand the latest The battle situation has repeatedly read the latest situation of the two armies, and based on this, formulate the next operational strategy. Of course, it is full of true and false records and war conditions, which not only affected the opponents at that time, but also caused endless troubles for historians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commanders of both armies once thought they could control the dissemination of information on the magic net. But it turns out that they are all wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic is such a miracle: it is an invisible network of people in the world's most self-centered, proud, and confident group. It is fundamentally different from the previous written records. Written records can be forged, can be consciously destroyed, and can be discarded from the collective memory of humans. As long as the flow of control information, you can control the information itself - this is the law since ancient times, it does not seem to be affected by the medium, whether it is mud, bamboo slips, sheepskin or electronics and fiber can be controlled by power and violence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the records on Magic Online cannot be destroyed and controlled. As long as someone has read a record, the record will use his or her reading to add value - the people who can use it are themselves the most dangerous violent holders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the existing records, it is generally believed that the Puzhou Campaign broke out on the evening of February 25. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this season, if your people are in Lenny, the cold wind should not have retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are in the Imperial Duran, there may still be snow on the ancient road bricks made of elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the hinterland of the Yellow Turban, the mango tree has blossomed this season, just after the flowering period, the green mango flower can be smelled in the air. aroma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with most state capitals, there are also large and small estates outside Puzhou. The industrious and brave Orientals brought in the agricultural technology and combined with Murray’s local folk customs to form a unique scenery of the Fort Worth Estate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manor located in the northwest of Puzhou and on the west side of Ruoshui River has a history of nearly a thousand years, before the introduction of Murphyman before the Taiping Road. People are planting mangoes here. The wooden lodge became a fortress of stone, and the fortress of the stone was broken into a Taoist temple. The Taoist reform became a brick house, and the brick house became the house of the monks and nobles... thousands of years Cycling, only mango trees and busy tenants are as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, near the Mango Park is a hunting house with masonry walls, fortifications and gardens, originally owned by Puzhou’s prefects, used to entertain The nobles who came to the cattle house. After the joint army striker arrived in Puzhou and changed to the state town, the stalwart of the Hengqu Zong immediately sent his most elite army here, ready to withstand the main force of the Qingniufu Guardian Army in the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, when the defender’s striker decided to go south, this nameless estate hunting house was also the first point they had to overcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Ma Jundeng = Myretin led the army, the Taoist scholars around him left such a record. Of course, in fact, the real speech of General Ma is much more vulgar than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of chicken, what kind of dog-like thing, you will kill them with the left army!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow! We will definitely recover the Green Bull House and one day recapture the giant deer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left military school came out. Although the slogan he said was slightly outdated, it was the slogan that Zhang Futu was shouting when he started his army more than ten years ago. In the past few years, the Guardian Army, which already has the Green Bull House, still shouted this slogan and captured the two provinces in the far east. The main force of the expeditionary army is still confronting the army of the Hua Dynasty. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before being forced to rate the enemy’s attack on the front of the enemy’s front, the horse’s arrogance is very good. He doesn’t want to put his own Throw in the stronghold guarded by the district governor. Behind him is not a local army that is suspicious and suspicious, but a 150,000-strong army led by the singer of the Green Bull House. He does not need to be eager for a moment. In his view, it is easy for the cavalry from the north to attack the defense of these central local troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the liaison officer of the Sansen Volunteer company around him does not fully agree with him. The quasi-elf magician from Jiawen Fegner left this view:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The simple hunting house is just a small brick The structure of the manor reminds me of the site of the stronghold built on the eastern border in the late imperial era, with anti-arrow walls, fences, trenches and shooting holes. This defensive building is hard to see in the hinterland and in the hinterland of Coman. However, it is still everywhere in the territory of the Tao. If there is an army with an average of more than half on the opposite side, it will be a nightmare for our army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, keep The army here is not the elite of the Sanctuary. When the left battalion's brigade repeatedly swept the enemy's city and fired the intimidating arrows on the wall, most of them simply shrank behind the low wall, and there were not many deadly arrows and magical rays coming out of the manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they did not surrender as General Ma’s expectations. After several rounds of trials and temptations, the left-wing monks began to strengthen the siege cars of the army, and sowed soybeans and potatoes on the ground, and used them to become soldiers pushing the siege car. Since Luo Ruide introduced the potato crop, the peas into the army has been picked up from the pile of paper, becoming one of the main battles of the Taiping Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow! Keep up! As long as the peasmen are dispelled by the other side, use your martial arts! The hustle and bustle is dead, and you will keep up with the cart! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auxiliary soldiers were driven out of the camp by the cavalry, rushing to the Hummer, behind the huge siege car. These siege cars were originally prepared for Puzhou City. For this small manor and low brick and wood walls, it is simply overkill - those siege cars are actually much higher than the walls of the unknown manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Luo Ruide used the potato for the first time, the Dongfang Yijun, who cooperated with the Yellow Turban, suffered a heavy loss. Then, just as all the new magic was discovered, people immediately began to study the way they confronted them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the potatoman stepped on the dispersal method buried with the plum pile. Under the control of the Taoist swords of the monks in the city, the roads were blown up, shattered, and the water mixed with black dog blood was blown out from the underground earthen jars, and the four scattered to the surrounding monks and bean soldiers. Anyone who has been touched immediately retreats and leaves the front to replenish the spell, and the bean soldiers change back to the original. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before expected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is the commander and monk in the nameless manor It is also the judgment of the school and the jurists of the cavalry outside the manor. These weak walls are unlikely to withstand the broken city of heavy siege cars, and the two armies can only win the game before the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First use the cheap Hummer to drag on, step on the trap and use the heavy horse!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Seeing that it is impossible to directly break through with the Bean Corps, Ma’s law has issued an offensive command based on the premise of saving troops and horsepower. The auxiliary soldiers who did not have armor braved the cold arrows, put the horses on the ropes, and excavated the plum piles while trying to avoid the traps and the trenches moving forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This speed of progress is of course very slow. Fortunately, the cold arrows on the wall have not been dense enough to be called the arrow rain, and the attacking forces can pay a little bit and push forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then, the unexpected sound sounded. It is like a hammering sound, dull and penetrating. This voice even spread to the general camp of General Ma Junji - he is also familiar with this voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the sound of more than two hundred heavy-duty armored volleys. This scaffolding musket was used by Southerners in the Freedom War to deal with the Coman All-A heavy cavalry and paladin, and successfully eliminated the heavy armor. Later, the scaffolding heavy guns also eliminated themselves and were sold to Murrayman and even the rulers of the Eastern Empire to counter the casters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red Yi re-raised the gun?! They really got caught up in the red, and actually prepared so many red and heavy guns!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two minutes, it was another round of volley. Two minutes later, it was the third round. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the deputy commander of Ma Jun’s law finally couldn’t hold back his emotions. He loudly told the guards around him: “Yingjin’s troops! No more Throw the precious cavalry and the sergeant here, just two seizure cars!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to the right army's school. "At least, we have confirmed that the troops here only dare to defend the city. Ma, before the other side’s scout post was discovered, they attacked the rear of them!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right military school was shocked by this chaos: “Follow, adults, this rear ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The enemy has sent a reinforcement. This magic net is really a good thing." The man named Maireding laughed. "It seems that the latest method of learning is not useless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the United Army, the first general of the force responsible for reinforcements was Colonel Schlopp Cliff, who was known as the "broken rabid dog". <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After strengthening the cavalry and magical powers, his troops rushed to the unnamed manor on the northwest side of the Ruoshui River to reinforce almost at the speed of the march. At first, the staff did not believe the intelligence of the yellow towel, but the large-scale change of the enemy in the northwest proved that there was a danger of war. After a lot of news appeared on the magic net, no one objected to the emergency reinforcement. The question is only how much emergency reinforcements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are more reinforcements, if there is a trap there, it may cause unbearable losses to the defensive circle of Puzhou; but the reinforcements are even worse. Most of the 30,000 people around are just admirers of the rebel army and speculative state soldiers. Once the outpost defeats, there will be no chain reaction to the collapse camp. No one knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the minutes of the staff meeting, at the time in the joint military command, the stalwart and the radicals were equally arguing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 150,000-strong army surrounded by siege has put too much pressure on people. More than one officer almost collapsed in the staff, voting to defeat the enemy in front of him. The striker immediately withdrew, even if he did not defeat the enemy striker. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This atmosphere reached its peak after Major General Dubreu Gaohao, the commander of the 14th "Zhuhai" division, voted for the withdrawal plan. He did not state his own reasons, but silently cast a vote for the withdrawal plan and then retreated to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, the door of Nerma Soledon’s governor’s lips only moved, but he did not speak, nor did he force the old general to speak. . He only agreed to the request of Colonel Cliff before the next lieutenant colonel who supported the retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speech was later recorded in the history of the Battle of Puzhou. Some historians believe that this paragraph may not be Cliff, but rather the conclusion of Nate Soleton's concluding remarks, but most people agree that this paragraph is indeed the original statement of "broken rabies". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are not facing an ordinary war. From a military perspective, what we should do now is to retreat. I believe everyone thinks so." Fighting 150,000 with 30,000 is a true foolishness. But I want to look at this issue from another aspect. If our retreat fails, not only will we lose the entire Murrayman, but maybe even the Interlakes and The officers, non-commissioned officers and elite soldiers trained throughout the Republic for several years have been buried here. It is the same as the result of defeat. But if we work hard to win, even though we may pay the same price, we have the opportunity to make this land It will always be part of the economics of our free nations. Our vessels will sail safely on the Qianlong Sea like sailing in the Intres Bay and the Emerald Bay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"What I want to say is that if we don't fight for victory, then it won't be possible. My vote is on the side of the battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Leiden Warlord and the Joint Commander of the United Army frowned slightly and suddenly came in: "Clock Colon. You have already disclosed this passage on the magic net, right?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rabid dog glimpsed, then exaggeratedly leaned back and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just learned to open the spell paradigm on the magic network, the settings are not very skilled. Sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then all of us, even our enemies should hear this speech." The door turned to Zhang Shiyi, and nodded. "So, I also voted for a fight. Kerry Colonel, you have to take responsibility for this mistake; whether we decide to fight or to retreat, we must first defeat the enemy’s first wave of attacks. It is up to your troops to reinforce the hunting estate in the northwest. No problem. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cliff thought a little, and asked: "The sun is setting. Are you planning to stay up late?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. The soldiers are very fast. In order to prevent any accidents, I will strengthen the half of the headquarters and the Zhang Qushuai cavalry. You will be strengthened by the staff. Core formation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To fight at night." Cliff used the most The voice said, "Is it because of my army’s experience at Lenny?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not necessarily does happen, but I don’t think the enemy will After this opportunity." Ningmen replied, "This is also the opportunity offered by the Magic Net. Such a big bait, the enemy may try to eat it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"The enemy cavalry was found in front!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reconnaissance of the cavalry returned the call from Cliff. Perhaps because of the tension before the battle, "broken rabies" has been repeatedly recalling the orders received in the staff and repeatedly recalling the prepared combat plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy really appeared, but he breathed a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough in our calculations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schlopp Kerry The husband whispered, untied his arm from the armed belt and placed it on the right arm with only two fingers. He looked around and the troops were still in the marching lineup, holding the torches high; but if you look closely, you can see that the regiment’s troops are actually many teams composed of officers, noncommissioned officers and magic users. Many of the torches are also tied to the tip of the spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath, raised his arms and repeated his words aloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone! The actions of the enemy are all in my expectation, they came to die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;An answer is a cheer. Tonight's combat plan has passed through all the officers and passed on to each team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The troops are ready to put out the fire! The gods and the right way are with us, the night battle is to chaos, we will be able to defeat this enemy! The princes worked hard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hooves came from a distance. Probably knowing that it had been discovered, the Guardian Army began to expand the search scope, and stopped the spy horse to start running to the joint army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creek looked around and found himself in a large grove of trees and Ruo River. The river in the distance is slightly glowing and moonlight, and the sparse woods are dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the cavalry will soon arrive here. In the mind, the colonel quickly rethought the battles of the regular infantry regiments that the Freedom Army had seen against the Imperial Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The formation will be between the Rushui River and the saplings! Each company will shrink according to the preparation, leaving a gap between the company, do not completely seal the road, leaving The smallest torch, the other torches are tied to the spear, the spears are inserted on the ground to form a rectangular array! Let the enemy cavalry pass!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse's hooves of the cavalry broke through the darkness, and the sound of the sound seemed to be a thousand horses. With Cliff's little military experience, he couldn't hear how many people there were in the cavalry, but he could be sure that the number of enemies was no less than two thousand - that is almost as much as the strength of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thousands of cavalry were divided into front and back, and the first one stopped at the front of the Clive group hundreds of steps, it seems Observe his battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of the right military school, the enemy in front of it is a formation between marching and combat. Each march was evenly cluttered with a spearman on the spot, and it was not a neat battle. The spear was tied with a torch in front of it, fearing that the enemy could not distinguish where its main force is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the commander of this reinforcements have nowhere to go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right military school is talking to himself , made a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The cavalry should not attack the prepared enemy, and should not fight at night...but since the enemy is so incompetent, I will accept this victory." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved his hand and ordered the troops to extinguish the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to prevent the bows and arrows of the infantry, tough and musket shooting, it is difficult to determine the position of the enemy in the dark; in contrast, those torches will be The position of the defensive army is suitable for the cavalry to use the hunting bow to kill the pikemen who lack heavy armor. He also divided the priests of the army into the first array, ready to use their few flying swords and more attack-type tactics to directly destroy each other's magic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all the preparations, he personally led the first team and began a wave of assault. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the ethnic minorities in the north and the desert and grasslands play against each other, the right military school is known for its bow and arrow technology comparable to nomadic people. He aimed at the enemy's front-ranking pikeman and shot it with one arrow; just like responding to his actions, the riders around him also shot deadly arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a few screams and more sullen from the enemy, but much less than he expected. The right military school looked at it with a fixed eye, but found that there were no people under the spears with the torches attached to the top, but supported by a metal iron rod! Moreover, the torch is not as sparse as it seems. It seems that two or even three times the torches of the torch are interspersed on the soft ground of the riverbank, forming a blockade of death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not rush! Don't rush out! From the gap!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;马急The right army of the army yelled, but the power and inertia of the wave charge was too great, and at least half of them could not hear his orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sensitive, highly skilled knights rushed past the gap between the company and the company, and the rest slammed into the soft land. However, it is fixed in the spear array fixed by magic. The roar of the horses screamed together, and the screams of the cavalry were mixed in. Although not many, each voice represented the disappearance of an experienced rider. At about the same time, the magical forces of the United Army fired at the cavalry that crossed the gap between the square and the phalanx. Under the command of the magic officer, four or five light and heavy muskets were grouped together, commanded by a person who had temporarily studied the night vision magic, and volleyed toward the cavalry. Although the cavalry did not fire, the high-density shooting often allowed the cavalry to be laid down. The monks of the Guardian Army also counterattacked with the Tao, but because it was difficult to find the correct counterattack position because of the darkness, they were defeated by the opposite middle-level wizards one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Low-low body! Rushing over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four thousand cavalry under the right military school. Almost all of this time, they came out and arranged a big assault arrow with a depth of seven or eight layers. Once such a huge charge arrow is launched, it can no longer stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless screams are like playing in his heart. These are the first-rate good men who have made many years of experience in the battle, but they have lost in this night battle that should not happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he feels that he still has a chance. This enemy army is at best 2,000 people, and it is impossible to carry more than 5,000 spears; as long as they rush and then turn the horse's head, these enemy forces must not maintain the same defensive power on the back -<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
