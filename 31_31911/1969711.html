The trees of the former Elf Embassy are directly transplanted from Sanson, and the diffused aroma is also conducive to calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor’s sister took out his handkerchief and wiped his face, suppressing the urge to catch up with Zhang Shiyi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hates the oriental woman with a yellow ribbon, and the eyes full of power make her think back to the court of the empire. The parasites around the imperial power have almost the same greedy eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it. It doesn't matter to me. If even the woman can't see it, then I can go back..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a rush of footsteps behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall silver-haired youth left the venue behind Olivia and faithfully carried out his own escort work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that the Freedom Army’s eyeliner is behind, and Ionette Hartman feels that she should not call Olia’s real name. Although the commander of the other party knew the identity of "Riv Namlock", it did not seem to tell others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io caught the back of his head and came up with a quirky title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Grand Counsellor. Are you in a hurry to leave suddenly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh. I just came to a cathedral for our parish." Olia reached out and pointed to the sun god church not far away, saying, "It's that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette looked up and looked at the Cathedral of the Sun God on the other side of the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even now in the evening, even if all the owners of the church have escaped or died, the sun's rays at the top of the cathedral still shine through the courtyard and The nearby streets are as white as they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io saw the relevant information before departure. The judgment of the Imperial Security Department is that the Elf Embassy is not convenient to buy a lighthouse, and chooses to use this method to show off power. Supported by the huge profits of Elf Oriental, this church is no worse than the Orthodox and Protestant ordinary cathedrals, probably only the twenty or thirty parish-level cathedrals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This church is the one that Nami Soleton spit out?" Io was a little alert in his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plenipotentiary ambassador still remembers what happened to Lennie: he will not underestimate the game that will be played in the palm of the hand. Young opponents. This time he came not only with the orders of the emperor and the commission of the security minister, but also with the vigilance of the southern rookie. Even Clade Lopez did not have such a brilliant resume at this age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not what he spit out, I want to come. It’s a good church." Oria nodded. "After a hundred years, we finally There is also a decent church in the Archdiocese of Intercontinental."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss, don't forget how you are right... promised to your brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Although I don’t feel that I can escape the eyes and ears of the Free Army, I don’t think that this passage will be heard by people over there. But the Archbishop still suppressed the voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are not here for the mission of the empire or the orthodox church. No one expects the Intercontinental to recover, nor expect us to It is a function of collecting intelligence. Please remember that we are not here with hostility. Don't do extra things and cause you to be in danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Olia resolutely retorted. The imperial princess feels that she is different from those who are hypocritical: she never uses it, and she does not want to hide her thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I like that person, I came here; if that person disappointed me, I will go back. I don’t think this will be with the empire. The interests conflict."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette sighed: "When you say this to your brother, I am next to it. I just want to know Why do you want to go down to this cathedral."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because it is. Probably."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The imperial princess hesitated, and rarely added an adjective indicating uncertainty to his emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a strong opponent? If you want to give up, Miss, your brother will be very happy -"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io this untimely joke, in exchange for a cool look of Olia. Her right foot was lifted at a speed that was difficult to capture with the naked eye, and the heel slammed heavily on the archbishop's upper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This foot is quite heavy, and Ionite almost pressed it and swallowed the scream back into his throat. The pain almost topped the sensation of a gunshot rifle on the breastplate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should be glad that I am not wearing high heels today, the patriarchal envoys."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I O'Neill looked at the woman in front of her with horror, only to think that the etiquette habits of "Riv Namlock" and the ceremonial habits of His "Olia Hugh Coleman" were completely different. When Olia was a princess, she couldn't do anything in the Imperial Court. When she was a free Orthodox priest, she could make a change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a room on the fourth floor of this building. I am going to pick the room now, then I will miss it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After smashing his bodyguard and guardian, Olia turned and re-entered the house in the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette watched her figure disappear into the side door. Afterwards, the Archbishop hurried down and licked the wounded part of his instep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The pre-prepared stress treatment magic was actually activated by her foot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Ionet sighed, sat down on the lawn, took off his shoes, and pulled out a tin jug for sacrificing the holy wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess of destiny is originally red wine, but Ionet prefers distilled brandy. Judging from the magical reaction, his goddess did not care much about the difference in alcohol preparation. He had a sip of wine and bowed his head on the instep of the foot that Olia had stepped on. If there is no healing magic, it is enough to smash his foot bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the Yangyan bell at the top of the church played. The elf's bell is not as loud as the human bell, nor is it a metal-sounding sound, which sounds like a long copper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are also very hard, Orthodox."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Sentinel responsible for surveillance of the courtyard Changed the job. He has been watching from the side of Ionite, leaving such a sympathetic word, and then quickly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop of Silver Hair covered his face with his hand and sighed as an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Freedom Army soldier left, he stood up and looked at the fourth floor of the original Elf Embassy until he saw his surveillance magic light disappeared. Turned around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Freedom Guard's regular guards actually operate the defensive magic array left by the elves... It's amazing. It seems that I don't have to worry about the above. Since there is The church, that still has the value of taking care of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io put Aoli's things aside for a while, to the church that is about to belong to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olia picked up her left eye and identified the defensive magic enchantment surrounding the fourth floor of the original Elf Embassy through her own magical field of view. Although she is a pastor of the Orthodox Church, she is also an elite who has been educated by the court since she was a child. The magical common sense of each school has been involved, and the natural magic that the elves are good at is no exception. More than a thousand years ago, Emperor Dudran was the accompaniment of the old elf empire, and the traces of the elf's natural magic were everywhere in ancient buildings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside her, several male and female gendarmes who are responsible for alerting this layer are watching her operations with utmost attention, two of them holding small books and clumsy A complete set of operating procedures is recorded with a erroneous grammar. One of them can see a large piece of new skin on the lower arm, which is evidence that the treatment of magic has just worked - the reckless wrong operation sometimes poses a great danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Ms. Namlock." As the captain’s lady’s official nodded, “When you started the Faction, you seemed to have some protective magic. Dispel, don't worry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, it doesn't matter." Olia showed a smile. "It's not an important magic. Then I can pick the room." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since it is the command of the Warlord, please take care of yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After saying goodbye to the soldiers responsible for the guard stairs, the imperial princess hurried through the corridors covered with Murrayman blankets and began to look for rooms in the original Elf station. Thanks to the days when the adventurers were wandering, Oria was able to deal with all kinds of people with such ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The new mage who has been in contact with magic for a few days is too bold. This level of defensive magic only triggers a sour liquid bomb. Count them for good luck..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the enthusiasm of these new wizards, Olia turns the corner of the corridor, not far from the biggest door Stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two guards are unloading the huge nameplate with the original owner's coat of arms and the long full name from outside the Elf's room. The abbreviation of "Sansen People and Senate" on the corner of the nameplate shines silver. Olia narrowed her eyes and recalled the relevant information through the name on the nameplate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two, troublesome, don't be too rude. The former elf ambassador, Mr. Fahnia, was a famous calligrapher two hundred years ago. He The nameplate of the handbook can sell at a high price, and it can be worth a few thousand crystals... If it is replaced by a gold pound, should it be more than 100,000 pounds?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The two soldiers who could not afford the spirit heard the number of "100,000 pounds" and almost slammed the nameplate that had been removed to half. Olia took the opportunity to introduce herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reeve. Reeve Namlock, the Warlord made you promise to give me a room, let me check the assets left by the elves. And traps. Can you ask the two to open the door near me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, good."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two soldiers placed the "100,000 pounds" on the carpet with great care and caution, and walked past it, opening a few doors for Oria. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you capture this, the magic checks the trap, and the main ones should be lifted. But there may be omissions..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem. I am also a person who has a bishop's instructor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliah, this sentence, that The shackles on the faces of the two soldiers were immediately replaced by reverence. The imperial princess nodded slightly, no longer paying attention to them, and pushed the door of the ambassador's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s finally coming in. He should pick this room as his room. It’s really a room for the elders, and none of the Imperial ministers have this. Kind of field."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that comes into view of Oria is the desk that is big enough for people to dance on. The empty, empty things on the table were taken away by the original owner; however, the art and potted plants around him could not be taken away, and they remained in place. In addition to the huge oil paintings that are more than ten feet in size, there are still some specially painted murals, which seem to come from famous designers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They also dare to go abroad with these hundreds of years of history. These fake, decadent and late elf empire styles..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The original collections of the Imperial Museum of Art are really just a part of 'more conservative'...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than a thousand years ago, the Holy Coman Empire It was the reign of the elf's brutal regime that established the unity of mankind, and they naturally sneered at the decay of the elf empire. In the official propaganda of the empire, because the male and female elves were in a safe period of almost impossible to get pregnant all year round, the culture of the entire contemporary elf was made up of the word "fallen" - after the elves discovered the wealth of the new world, The fall of the ancient elf empire finally had recurring capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the tension between Honglinasti and DeLand, there is no formal diplomatic relationship between the two, there is only one in the Imperial Duran According to the customary half-elf, the "Principal Agent of the Accompanying House" does not have such a high-level elf embassy for the Princess Royal Highness to observe. The Minister of the Port of Hong Kong is served by a real elf veteran who supervises the important branch of the Elf Oriental Company. It is second only to the Ambassador of the Lenny and the Ambassador of the Green Cattle in the entire external envoy system of Sansen, and of course can represent Honglinas. Give the most orthodox fashion trends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oria grew up listening to the propaganda of "an ancient elf is noble and elegant, the contemporary elf is ridiculous", but she really surprised her when she saw the real thing. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, this one I think should be removed...this is also..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Olia appreciates one by one, and each one seems to confirm the imagination of the majority of the imperial subjects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most art works with women, if they are illustrations of books, will make this book burned by the Dagong Church Faith Theory Department; another small part of the art No woman - according to the standards of the Faith Theory Department, these man-only works of art should be burned under any circumstances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned over the "over-fire" paintings, ready to wait for two female gendarmes to be catalogued for sale. She is not a radical ascetic, but she does not intend to leave these paintings in her own vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So to say...difficult, not the legendary..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial princess suddenly remembered What, hurry to the bedroom of the Elf Ambassador. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olia can occasionally hear rumors of the imperial aristocrats who have been to Sansen. In those legends, each of the Elf nobles has a bedroom with a dark door and a luxurious giant bed that is "10 times larger than the emperor's bed." As for the elves who are at least three or four hundred years old, regardless of men and women, each person has at least a dozen wives, mistresses, ex-wife and hundreds of bed companions, only the royal aristocrats of the Eastern Empire can compare with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the bedroom was blasted by the gendarmes who had previously checked the embassy, ​​but it saved her time to open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is indeed a carved wooden bed in the bedroom that is outrageous to human standards. Although it is a princess of the empire, Olympia's luxury bed in the DeLand Palace is only a quarter of this size, and there is no such thing as a good workman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four-corner carved columns are made of whole giant wood, the surface of which is carved from at least seven or eight different kinds of wood, with the hands of the elf craftsman. spell. There are more than five or six steps in the length and width of the bed. It seems that people can lie down in a class. It is not too much to pull up the tabernacle and say that it is an independent small room. In the handicraft industry, the craftsmen of the elves also have hundreds of years of experience, and their craftsmanship is even better than the best court masters of the Eastern Empire, not to mention the well-known Koman products. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mattress is filled with a thick natural sponge, and the elegant aroma of various herbs is revealed. Olivia didn't hesitate for a moment in front of the bed, and did not hesitate to slam on the soft mattress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days of sailing and a sleepless night, no one can hold back the temptation to roll on such a giant bed - what? Kind of self-control is not good either. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... it seems that I can’t help myself alone..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sheets are noticeable It was turned over, and the pillows were piled in the corners. By the way, if the pillows and pillows were enclosed, there were dozens of pillows on the bed and a few silk quilts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olia immediately imagined that the officers and men of the Magic Task Force couldn’t help but roll and throw the pillow after seeing the bed, and then they were busy The grass is restored to its original state. The simple, sloppy military style is never seen by the servant of the embassy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the influence of those fragrances, Olia almost fell asleep. I don't know how long it took to lie, she was awakened by the conversation from the outhouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The meaning of the Guardian Marshal is that he wants to take over 50% of the shares of the phase port business? This is too much. I have represented the major families and companies. Members have negotiated, we must have their participation in order to stand in the phase port. They have to subscribe for 30%, we only have to stay 20% is not enough, Marshal Lopez also counted on us to become a new army to supplement him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The cost of the Seventh Fleet is also very large. If you feel that this number is not enough, we can add some."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides of the conversation seem to be Nami and the special envoy of the Navy. There was no door in the bedroom, and the sound outside was clearly transmitted to the house. I don't know why, it seems that the guard did not report her existence, and no one came to see the bedroom. The princess guessed that the 100,000 pounds of calligraphy works scared them. They were busy going to put the things in the library and forgot to check if she had left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That would be the case. We opened up the banking and shipping business of the new company. The Seventh Fleet has more ships, so the shares in the Eastern Route Company More than a little; we need more day-to-day operations, so the shares in this new United Bank are much better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the door is very hoarse . After the day's fighting and the bargaining in the evening, the young majors have been relying on willpower to support themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what is your suggestion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trade business in the Eastern Route Company, The Seventh Fleet accounted for 60%. The coinage, banking, settlement, and insurance businesses were all placed in United Bank, and the Seventh Fleet accounted for 30%. I will come up with a part of the funding gap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander of the fleet was silent for a moment. When Naomi thought he was going to say "I need to ask for this plan," the lieutenant spoke again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, we will add another 4 million pounds. We account for 65 in the Eastern Company and 35 in the United Bank. Is the deal?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you need to ask the Guardian Marshal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, the sergeant is at Lingyangmen I have never been worried about economic issues, I can be the master of this matter. Is it a deal, Lord Solayton?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The deal, Lord Fisher. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two laughed loudly, and Olia in the bedroom didn't smile at all." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial princess did not have the slightest interest in collecting this information. Her only thought now is to hurry to find a place to hide herself. The door is no problem, and Oria is sure that the navy special envoy does not want others to hear the details of these transactions. But this bedroom has no doors, and any movement can be immediately heard by two outsiders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, has the fleet of Lord Fisher been stationed in the port since then?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Where. The main fleet of Intreus has suffered almost no loss, we will soon start searching. There are many islands and peninsulas in the narrow sea, and the hydrology is complicated. I estimate that the Marshal will soon order the search for enemy forces. The fleet is gone. My personal opinion is that the enemy is likely to withdraw the ports that were captured by us. If this is the case, then the army trained by Lord Solayton will be bothered to help retake those territories."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two outside have already started a meaningless chill. Olia climbed gently into the depths of the bed, trying not to make a sound. She could hardly think of any magic that would be suitable for this situation, and she would not dare to use the magic to escape the risk of activating the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is the Elf's bedroom, there should be a lot of hidden doors for the mistress and the lover..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Olivia’s eyes searched wildly on the surrounding wooden walls and furniture. Unfortunately, there aren't a few things that look like hidden doors. Except that the wardrobe is the bookshelf, it seems that this statement is really a rumor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, she suddenly noticed dozens of pillows that piled up in the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is also a manifestation of the glory of the Free Army. The warlords of the Kingdom of Sinclair and Murrayman, I am afraid that we have lost the capital, and the day of the death of the country is ready." Commander Fisher gave two laughs. "I want to After recovering the lost land, Lord Wei Taiping also intends to teach the guys around him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the cover of the conversation between the two, Olia carefully put the pillow Pick it up one by one, pick up the sheets and drill in. She arched her waist and shrunk into a ball, dressing herself up as a big pillow buried under the sheets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent this image from being revealed immediately, she collected the scattered pillows and buried the body under the sheets. At first glance, I still had the seat. Pillow mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That’s it. The army is quite hard today, I won’t bother you to rest...”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men chilled for a while, then the footsteps of the Admiral’s lieutenant slowly disappeared into the hallway, and the footsteps of several guards also came back and regained their vigilance. Olia slowed down the rhythm of breathing and waited for the door to enter the back room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh..." The young major stretched out and yawned, starting to visit these luxurious rooms like Oria, "These The overturned painting is that the magic even thinks it is worth the money. Since it has been turned over, why is it not shipped to the warehouse? I don't need this... Hey, what is this painting... Wow. Hey. Oh. Oh. Hey. Anyway, this matter is not anxious. After two days, it will be shipped again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His footsteps became rushed and turned to the bathroom direction. The bathroom also had no doors, and Oliya didn't have time to get in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, is this bathtub made of a whole giant wood? What is this? There is a magic reaction... Wow! Good, hot!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intense water sound suddenly sounded like a magician placed a water gun or a acid bomb next door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the sound of the water turned into a small stream of water, and then it grew bigger again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds like Nana is experimenting with some kind of magic item. Olia didn't dare to go out because she didn't know how long the sound of the water would last. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is called... shower, bath? Is this the culture of the elves? Oh, no wonder those guys are so white... specially made magic items for bathing, It’s a luxury. If you use a very expensive gem, you can only work for a few minutes. What? Can it be achieved mechanically? Well, this sounds very interesting, Anne, we can find a place to build a water tower. ...... ah, this kind of shower actually has a dozen! The life of the veteran is really too decaying!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water sound stopped. Olia couldn't hear the footsteps of the door, probably because his boots were soaked. Fortunately, the voice of the door to self-talk can still let her know his position - he is coming to the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Should it be wet to find clothes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olivia The whole body is wrapped under the sheets, you can't see the outside situation, you can only guess the action of the door by voice. When the position of the door was at the door of the bedroom, he suddenly stopped talking - as if he was suddenly scared by something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The princess opened her lips slightly, took a deep breath, and slowly spit it out, not daring to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you mix it? Or did he already find me? If so, how ridiculous it is... How can she explain the fact that she is hiding in the bedroom as a pillow? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence outside is so uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, such a big bed...God. The escaping ambassador, is this big bed intended to use?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the sound of the closet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly rubbing off the clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of some heavy objects being put down sounds like scattered things like sabre, ammo packs, and guns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close the sound of the closet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the whole person falling on the sponge mattress -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The princess of the empire finally sneaked The ground was relieved, and the body that had been trembling was finally relaxed. It seems that Nami Soleton, like everyone else, can't resist the temptation to roll around in this huge bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call... Sure enough, look at the messy sheets, the guys and guards of the Magic Team are probably rolling over. The elves will really enjoy it. Ah! I actually have a day to enjoy this big bed!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is rolling out on the sponge mattress while releasing a speech without a promising statement. Go, still stood up and jumped twice. These vibrations were transmitted through the mattress, and Oria had to work hard to hold back the urge to sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but just relaxed, the next sentence of Naimen almost stopped her breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These guys are still playing pillow fight here? The pillows are so sloppy piled up there, are you afraid that others don't know? But the pillows are not really How much..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shock stopped and it became the slow vibration of the person crawling on the mattress. The princess panicked the nails of the little finger of the right hand, cut out a front, and carefully pierced the sheets with the sharp nails and picked out a small hole for peeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olivia narrowed her eyes and carefully watched the movement of the door. The lighting in the house is not dark, the bright blue light of the magic light is cast on the door of the door that gradually comes in her direction, reflecting it...reflecting...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No, no shirt!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eye that Olia peeped almost blinked. The clever imperial princess immediately rebuilt the chain of reasoning: Nami Soleton was drenched in the "magic shower" when he experimented with it, and when he saw this big bed, he naturally took off the wet clothes... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From her point of view, only the young major can barely see the upper body, but she also does not want to confirm whether the door is wearing pants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't come over. Don't come over. Don't come over..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olia is deep in the heart Repeated silent shouts repeatedly. She really didn't know what to say in this situation. What should a semi-naked Free Army major and a female bishop who is lying under his sheets and dressed as a pillow meet? She once thought about several developments that she and he might have, but definitely did not include this strange story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, when the door climbed halfway, the outside bell rang again in a timely manner. When I heard the bell, the door stopped moving and seemed to think of something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, it’s time to make an appointment. One can’t play with a pillow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He relaxes the whole body, and the whole person slams into the sponge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There's the last job... take a shower and change clothes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The door was so unwilling to climb up with the door that was about to overflow, and dragged his foot to the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he saw his figure disappearing out of the door, Olia immediately bowed up and crawled under the sheets, jumping out like a squirrel The bed, one got into the closet -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of the size of this wardrobe, it should be called the cloakroom. This cloakroom was more than enough to put down two classes, and it was full of all kinds of luxurious dresses that the former owner could not take away, enough for her to hide behind those clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a lot of security, but at least there is no magic lighting and half-naked man, Olia thinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the shower continues to ring. Every few minutes, the sound will stop once and continue to sound after its owner replaces the new shower head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the sound of the water was also whistled, and the content of the whistle was the southern national anthem that Olia was familiar with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thought only passed in her mind and was immediately vetoed by herself. The bathroom door was also bombarded by the magic team, and she will be seen when she goes out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of water finally stopped. The footsteps of the door became a wet "squeaky", dragging the elf's wooden slippers back to the bedroom. He pulled open the closet and didn't look deep. He just pulled out a set of pajamas and checked the magic reaction and put it on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Olya breathed a sigh of relief, she suddenly heard the harsh sound of the magical effect of the start of the "kindness". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which is this?" said the door, leaning back against the wall and retreating to the door. "If it’s your own, please say it. If it’s a misunderstanding. I don't call the guards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olia's face turned red. She remembered that she had pulled out under the sheets and had to leave an unusually obvious mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But going out now? She also hesitated. Not to mention that the door is likely to be wrapped in a bath towel, she will undoubtedly let the guards at the door be punished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Olia stretched out the door to open the door, a little familiar and crisp female voice came from the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a hero of Lenny. I just discovered it when I arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The glass window inlaid with stained glass suddenly became translucent, emitting a slight green glow, and the phase effect was activated. It is with this kind of Dongyi magic technology that the Interlakes built a great wonder, the Phase Bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should have been curious about how you discovered it, but these should be the secrets of your Western magician. You are known to use magic." Habits, should it be very bad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the door is still pressed on the hilt, full of vigilance to look at the coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Zhang Shiyi of a black tight-fitting nightsuit passed through the window and passed lightly across half of the room, stopping in the middle of the bed, without making a slight sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I originally wanted to wait for you to take a shower and come in normally. Your guards are not allowed to make an appointment with you, I have to make a decision, sorry. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was paused, probably remembering his own order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, please Miss Zhang..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little wing."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, then Miss Miss Wing, what are you doing in this late night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi smiled and raised his hand to manage the ponytail. He jumped up and fell to the side of Nermen Soledon. Her right hand happened to block the route of the door-to-door sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am here to give you a big gift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frowning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that late in the night, you will not be bribing. If you are going to say that the gift is your own, then this joke is not too funny, small Miss Wing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi did not answer this question positively, but raised a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You and Wei Taiping have already controlled half of the Eastern Route, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doorman nodded. "Well. You can say that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But actually, this half of the route is controlled by the Marshal, not your hand. Inside, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question is quite sharp. The door was not angry, and nodded. He replied briefly: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gift I want to give you is the other half. Eastern Route. From the Green Bull House to the other half of Lingyangmen. I can help you get the whole Murrayman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
