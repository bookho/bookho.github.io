In the initial position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two huge gaps rushed into the ranks of the Freedom Army, and any military strategist would shake his head when he saw this scene - except those who were in the middle of the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Colonel Luther sent a commander, and the central government was in a hurry. Please move the command post to the general!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not move. Let the two wings rotate in the middle, use the gun to cover, and resist the attempt of the other party to expand the gap. Luther still has no experience. Such a good start, it is hard to give the other side a central Breakthrough.” Listening to the report of the staff, Klad shook his head. “It’s already the second time to move the command. Then the troops will be paralyzed. You can’t fill the reserve team of Luther, our general reserve team will also Fill in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff member hurriedly persuaded: "That is the guards who attacked the monsters in the snow line and the wilderness. The equipment is the same as the Republic." Well, one of the five people can use magic, and under that kind of fire coverage, there are still 80% of them coming into our position. Admiral is still moving backwards, so that even if Luther’s troops are smashed, we can regroup... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it not two thousand guards? Wandi **? We 20,000 people can't stand them? Now the two wings are launching a counterattack, as long as we stand up here, the whole war is over! Tell Bishop Luther!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crad's fist beat the gun on the side of the gun and made a pit. Iron-casting guns are actually not strong enough, especially in the face of high-level wizards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Through me, I gave him the commander of the General, and the Steelburg Army became officially compiled! He can get the rank of Colonel through the magic certification, it should still be Some abilities. Tell him that if he can't stand it, I will fill it out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending away the commander, Clade looked up and looked at the dragon that had already moved to the north, and sighed and raised the telescope: "Sure enough, just send someone to go or can't stop it." Emperor... ah?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put down the telescope, rubbed his eyes, lifted it again, put it down again, and blinked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time engraving the battlefield<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Expanding the gap! Expanding the gap!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobility officers shouted screamingly, the lower-level commanders of the Knights’ Order The black soldiers who led the team and the team rushed through the open space between the two armies and pounced on the enemy's flag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These emperors don’t have the same magical cover as their fellow Guards, and naturally they have no ability to form a squad to quickly jump over this death. Ground. They still listed a rigorous military array, listening to the rhythmic sound of the military and snare drums, and crossed the battlefield at a steady pace. The artillery fire of enemy field guns and self-propelled guns on both sides exploded among them, and each shell would allow three or five people to leave the battlefield temporarily or forever. The guns of Kegler’s garrison were also opened, and they tried their best to support the advancement of the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the Empire! For Your Majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more advanced command unit, the flagpole of the command flag The higher. Now, every emperor can see Luther’s Stilburg Army flag and the first division’s flag. These two high flags have been trapped in black and silver, with more than ten nearby. The imperial camp flag is flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, everyone can see the emperor and his dragon in the distance. The invisible flag hung high in the sky in the northwest, causing the entire front to tilt slightly to the north. No one wants the top commander to see the troops that he commanded collapse. As long as the silver dragon is still there, the emperor can endure more casualties and make a drone assault that they could not have made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Use Luther's head to greet your majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon flies up and down between the clouds and the ground, flying back and forth quickly, hovering and even turning in the air, changing Different postures. Most people are cheering for this, and only a small number of commanders are faintly disturbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is clear that no enemy is intercepting, why is it going to be...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The commander also raised the telescope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the crowded air <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong is flying closer and closer to the battlefield, and has been able to hear the cheers of the emperors -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they When I could see the emptying, the cheers were cut off by this sudden blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this distance, everyone can see a disproportionate tail behind the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rope is dragged behind the dragon, and it can barely be seen with two small dots on it. I can barely see the two men wearing blue costumes, obviously not the emperors - and they are still crawling on the dragon back without hesitation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene is so fantastic, the fantasy is so that even a trace of rational people blinked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silver Dragon has long found this. But she can't see her back, and she can't give enough damage to the enemies there. She can only harass with little power magic that doesn't require concentration or aiming. It is a pity that the opponents there are not able to deal with these blind magic. The following two people have opened a filter shield on their own, can ignore all the magic of small power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong strives to do all kinds of flying stunts and tries to get them down, but these efforts are not effective. After finishing a high-difficult action of diving to the ground, Yinlong was frustrated to find that the "tail" in the back was still not smashed down. He couldn't help but ask the two people behind him: "So you don't let go, are you really afraid of death?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Afraid. Just, sometimes you can't let go anyway. By the way, I agree with your point of view that power is better than all strategies." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne’s voice sounded very pleasant, and there was a hint of madness in the laughter, which seemed to be aroused by nature. A handful of hands are hooked on a translucent green glue line, and the end of the glue line is wrapped around the roots of the silver dragon's wings. She moved around between the two ropes, and the silver dragon's magic all flew over her shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic glue line has a characteristic: its viscosity will increase with the increase of pressure, and it will be weak when it is not strong. Suitable for climbing, it was the preferred method of climbing the siege in the Middle Ages. Her waist is also wrapped around an activated safety rope. The material of this safety rope is a twisted pair of steel wire. It is a composite structure to avoid the attack of the dragon knights. Of course, this should not happen in this era at all. thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t irritate her, Anne! My toes have just been wiped to the ground!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The door is also hung on the two lines of glue, the position is slightly lower than her, and the posture is not so chic. If Anne looks like an elf that leap between the two ropes, the door looks like a salted fish hanging on one of the ropes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rubber cable mixed with activated wire is not so good, although it is sticky, but also quite personal. Every time he tries to grab another rubber cable, the rubber cable will start to shake up and down spontaneously, that is, he is not willing to let him hold it in his hand. But when he is going to climb up with a rubber cable, another rubber cable will sway and interfere... It is sticky, and it won't fall off automatically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you afraid of? Her long tail is not rubbed to the ground, how can we take us to the ground?" Anne's hand is on two rubber cables Knocking, the top of the cable is wrapped around the dragon wing for two laps. "Sorlayton, grab it, and immediately reach the top! This dragon is too threatening to fight below, can't retreat!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am working hard." The door slammed another piece of rubber. "The document says that the activated item will have the personality of the owner... that is true. Ah."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know them, can you persuade?" Olivia rubbed her wrist. "The rope is swaying, it's hard to play. If you fly or float the target, you can track it more. Now you can only use the weak auto. Tracking magic hits has no effect at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s useless to say this to me. If I can control them, let them go!" The flame emerged from the right index finger of Reneka, and the steel rope was repeatedly burned. "These things are still iron, can't burn, cut down constantly... Only one more stunt action. Use dive."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you use it? I don't think those two people can be scared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You I also found out?” Yanikaka raised her eyebrows. “Yes, their two common characteristics are hard to get around. We were not determined enough, of course we can’t afford them... if they don’t let go at the last minute, We will land forcibly! So they will be let go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asia proud mask finally shake a bit. "Are you serious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course. I am afraid that I can’t get rid of them." Renee thought that the following is Anne and Nanimen. I felt an upset and made up my mind. "Mara, speed up with flying magic, we have to pull up vertically and pull up beyond the clouds!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Silver Dragon took a deep breath. Throwing vertically upwards. This action caused a rapid shearing wind under her huge body, and even the activated steel cable was straightened in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne’s wrist trembled, allowing the body to slide freely on the cable, dispelling the sudden impact. She was nervous about the other party's intentions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the used trick going to be used again? This is not like the style of Seneca... Is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, Yanika is determined to hit the ground! What to do, jump?" The door of the door hanging like a dead fish hanging on a steel rope shouted. He felt terrible friction on his shoulders and elbows and felt a little bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't jump! Grab the door, climb the door, climb up, grab it! We must climb up and we must win before the dive!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door looked at his position and found that he had at least thirty positions from the dragon's back, and Anne had only ten positions. If it weren't for the buffering magic that he didn't prepare for the high altitude, he had to give up the fight and jump. The magic that he can use to save lives is only a "create", this magic can make a parachute to save the life. In any case, it is impossible to climb thirty positions before diving, and it is even less likely to be in the case of joint strain...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before diving?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's wide-eyed, staring at the silver dragon and the knights on the dragon's back, suddenly got an idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, can you listen to my command? Don't question, slip to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The young woman took a moment and executed the order without compromise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher the silver dragon is, the faster and faster it is. Five thousand feet, ten thousand feet, and one thousand five thousand feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All eyes are gathered on the silver dragon that goes straight into the sky like a sharp arrow. For a good mood. For a win or loss. For a fate. For a victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the air and on the ground of Kengal, no one has retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faintly thin cloud has surrounded the body, resisting the door and closing the eyes, listening to the whistling of the wind. In this whistling, there is a sound of breathing from the silver dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dive!" Renee whispered. Of course, this order is not heard by the door, but he can suddenly hear the throsh of the silver dragon suddenly relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his eyes. "Annie, loosen the cable, now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a chance when Silver Dragon tries to force the brakes and turn down and dive down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only chance. Resist the door to endure the instinct of fear, staring in the vast blue sky and staring at the dragon not far away. The dragons are down, and they are up -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the two sides are as high. No, he and Annie are going to be higher. The direction is reversed, almost vertical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, use the wind!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand. Tight, don't twist Pinch!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie grabbed his arm and cleaned it, bringing the two people back to back. She used the other hand to raise a calculated blast diagonally upwards, adjusting the speed and direction of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proximity is also faster than expected. The door was busy preparing for the magic, and he chose those contact types. He knew that the next battle would happen on the narrow dragon's back. He could even see the stunned faces of the two "Olia"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, there is a face expression that is not awkward? That expression is hard to describe... probably described as "I have long anticipated what you would expect to do." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mala, avatars!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; see the situation changes, 黛妮卡 decisively The command to swoop was cancelled. She didn't want to wrestle with the two guys at all. Instead of having a win-win battle, it is better to choose an unknown air battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle line stagnate, everyone is shrinking behind the simple bunker and looking up at the sky, forgetting the battle in front of them. The dragon disappeared from their front, leaving only a few black spots and two steel cables that could not be clearly seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the disappearance of the silver dragon, the scheduled landing site disappeared, leaving only the thin clouds, blue sky and the earth in front of the door. Then he felt a darkness in front of him - the opponent who also began to fall freely counterattacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether in the Emperor or in the Freedom Army’s Magic Warfare Handbook, it’s repeated efforts to emphasize “free fall air warfare” and “floating air warfare” Avoid the situation. When you are free to fall, no one dares to start the deceleration magic or open the target's conspicuous parachute, and let yourself become the opponent's target. Relatively speaking, most magic is difficult to aim at high speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the first counterattack was completely out of the expectation of the door: a horseshoe bottom was exactly on his head, with a certain The kinetic energy of the princess allowed him to subconsciously withdraw the hand that was caught in Anne's arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the difference in the speed of the two sides is not large, otherwise the blow is enough for his brain to crack. The man looked down and saw him stepping on him, and he did not hesitate to take another extra foot. Of course, this foot in the air is also soft and inexhaustible, only barely separate the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let this body become as light as feathers...featherfall!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; From this spell, Nana has determined the identity of the other party. With the character of Monica, she should have carefully read the Magic Warfare Handbook. He patted the soil on his hair, his mouth slightly upturned, and disdainfully began to prepare to deal with the magic of the live target on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, I am fixed, you capture..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Feathering!" "Feathers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and wanted to speak to the people behind him, but found his judgment to be biased. People other than him don't care about the code of conduct, and they are not afraid to waste magic. These people use feathers to minimize their weight and increase air resistance to the maximum. Now, even the least powerful magic is enough to change their speed and direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie grabbed a section of the cable, Mara was wrapped around another arm, and the right arm was bent inside the other princess. The two sides launched a fierce close-fitting battle through the steel cable. The contact spells with powerful recoil, the projection spells and the dragon flames entangled together, and they made a harsh sound on each other's magic shields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the background of blue sky and white clouds, the magical glare of both sides constitutes a beautiful light and shadow picture. Anne’s magic is visually simple, but the effect seems to be It does not fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That said, this is the one that the dragon didn't protect is that of Nika?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door also noticed that another cable is within reach of his right hand. The place is falling. The lieutenant reached out and grabbed the fingertips and quickly painted the control figure that Annie told him. He remembers that the full length is 20 meters. Still enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Entangled! Extend!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel cable was straight and barely hooked False Princess's noble ankle. Before the other party reacted, the cable had quickly extended upwards, tying her hands behind her, preventing her from using magical resistance. The cable was automatically wrapped around his left arm as ordered, and soon "Olia" was pulled to his side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is very rude, lieutenant." The other side struggled a few times and failed to struggle. "So both of us will fall to death."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door tightened the rope, grabbed her waist without scruple, and the other hand rose upwards, using the magic of creation that had already been prepared. The huge parachute popped up from his fingers and opened, preventing the two from falling quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind has slowed down and boasted on him and her face. The door smiled softly and loosened a little steel cable, letting the two descend slowly together in this romantic light breeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of "Olia" is indeed quite beautiful, there is a feeling of mixed with glamorous and elegant, and the door believes that it is the necessary quality of the ancient kings of Coleman. The result of accumulation. However, he still prefers to see the look of his childhood girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, let me be patient. Wait until you get to the ground and you are free to leave. Renee, you can change back to the original."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman in his arms was stiff and turned his head. "Sorry, Lieutenant, you admit the wrong person. The one above is your nickica."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, that’s the dragon didn’t let go, it’s impossible It’s fake.” Residents looked at the beautiful woman who was close at hand and swallowed and couldn’t help but pinch the other’s cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your make-up is getting more and more exquisite, it looks so beautiful..."Nica."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Because of panic and fear, the small lips are slightly reddening cherry red. The sudden impulse controlled the rationality of the door, and he couldn't help but kiss it. The other side struggled a few times, but did not struggle to tie the ropes -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle stopped and everything seemed to disappear. Between heaven and earth, only the men and women who are kissing are left. Even the battles over the sky stopped, and both sides of the fight stared blankly at the parachute below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kiss gives people a feeling for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really mistaken, lieutenant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is raised and looks For a moment, the smile on my face was stiff. There is no powder on the fingertips, and there is no lipstick on the lips...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean it? Is the dragon protecting her?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." The other person’s face has turned into a crimson due to congestion. "No one has ever been... this rude..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door quickly remembered a certain knowledge. Royal blood. He...he...he kissed the great heir to the great empire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the appearance of an elegant brunette beauty, it is actually a two-legged killing weapon. Now he does not want to test the authenticity of the other party's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle left arm trembled and released the female in the arms like a kite. Almost at the same time, the tidal silver pure flame erupted from the princess and squatted on his parachute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air re-flows, the resistance turns into wind, the wind is promoting combustion, the wing is turned into fly ash, and the fall begins again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, Isaac; Newton will begin to write the famous paper to explain the calculation of gravity acceleration, but this does not affect the common sense of the door. Know that you will fall faster and faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With magic, Olia! Use magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other end of the cable does not respond. He glanced at the ground, and now their height is low enough to see the front lines of the two armies. The situation seems to have fallen into complete stagnation, and morale only depends on their performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it. I have left the real princess, how much can I help her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The door is thoughtfully smiled, while holding the cable, while letting himself fall freely in the air. Anne is fighting with the dragon, and probably won't have time to rescue him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and looked at the clouds that were getting farther away and...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Free army uniform in front of you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sonyka?" He exclaimed. I won't admit it this time, and the dragon who left the dragon to deal with Anne is staring at him. Her speed is incredibly fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are wrong, I don't want to leave her. Of course, it is not to save you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s eyes are so clear, she flew down the rope for a short period of time, blocking the magic of the princess’s overflowing, and she gradually calmed down and snatched away from the door. Yanika also made a beautiful roundabout kick by the force of the undershoot, and the tip of the boot was beautifully on the chin of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the contemptuous eyes, Lieutenant subconsciously argued: "Don't misunderstand, I just mistakenly believe that she is you, never want to..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it? Then you just tied her up like that?" Yanika snorted. "You have no magic? Let me save you again." Let this body become like a feather..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell suddenly became a scream, because the heel of the other female boots is behind the eyes of 黛尼卡He kicked a heavy foot. The other two people except her raised their heads and happened to see the beautiful girl officer who was carrying a deformed dragon with a steel rope hurriedly landed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne is faster and more violent. The silver dragon was turned over by the fast-falling power and was trying in vain to break the steel rope hanging from the neck with his front paws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne also stared at him with some unspeakable look--like the look of his own eyes. It was followed by a knee-scratch that was equally crisp and straightforward - both she and Yanika were confident in their skills. However, this time it really didn't take much time to land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to mess in this place?" "You misunderstood!" "So what did you want to do?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mara, come back again!" "I have to hit the ground!" "Who is controlling the rope?!" "Open parachute, parachute!" "Reverse shock!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as "floating in the sky with you, slowly falling down romantically". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shouts of everyone are mixed together, more than two parachutes are opened at the same time, sticking together with the steel rope with colloids, and one is closing the wings The dragon struggled in the parachute...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, this large group of men, women and dragons forcibly landed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's falling! The dragon has fallen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the big entanglement Together, men, women and dragons lying on the ground like meteors, Clade; General Lopez finally raised his hand. The morale of the enemy is no longer so high, and the fighters are fleeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...It’s now. The two-wing reserve team is assaulting! Take the fall point as the axis! Don’t let them pull back!”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the voice just fell, he saw a similar indication from the Stilburg Army flag not far away. Colonel Luther’s grasp of the fighters has gradually matured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Army officers shouted "The Emperor is dead!" launched a counter-attack and the battle continued to be disturbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young lieutenant who was in pain was struggling to get out of the dust and looked at the friendly army who was approaching, knowing that his mission had been completed. Taking advantage of Anne is still playing with the beautiful dragon dragging on her wrist, he turned to Yanika, and he stopped talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinica clearly knows what he wants to ask, and replies with his hair: "I can't stay here, needless to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then let's go. You have made a choice." The door turned to Anne. "What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't have any opinion, anyway, the war here is over." Annie licked her arm, her sleeves had been torn apart several times. "And, Miss Mara, don't try to use it in human form." Bite!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your understanding, Annie and Soledon." Yanika snorted and smirked out, "I am for you." The tooth print on the arm apologized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny reached out and stopped her. "I have the last question. Where is the emperor?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In short, he is not in Kengler. Sorry I can only say so much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡揉着站Get up. She knows that she can't fly now, I am afraid I can't take off. Yinlong sensed her thoughts, re-expanded her wings, and prepared for take-off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be a period later, the heroes of the Free Army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very bright smile, There has never been a smile on the face of a real princess. The real Olia saw this smile, stunned, and smiled bitterly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen and Annie did not try to intercept her again. In the shout of "The emperor escaped! The Guards surrendered!", the lonely figure of Yinlong soared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinica added with the voice that only Olia can hear: "The answer, you will soon know."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the battleline that began to collapse, the princess finally recovered from the chaotic state after the outbreak, and spoke. "Why are you saving me? Are you really on our side? We are probably the ones who failed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First, I am just I found myself still not suitable for doing bad things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl of Jubilee rubbed her face with her hand and restored her original appearance. Her tone sounds like it came from another world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Second, I can only say that I am lucky enough to complete the task I was assigned, everything is as expected. Third, I am not interested in returning to that guy. Go over there. Let them celebrate for the time being, they can't guess the ending."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, although I still can't understand your motivation, or say Ambition - but I believe in you. I believe that one can laugh so brightly..." Olia's expression is a little embarrassed, "Friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you "His Royal Highness..." Renee was busy changing his voice. "No, my friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 finally breathed a sigh of relief and knew that she had passed. The most difficult one. With Olia's guarantee, she can at least ensure the credit and safety of her time. According to her impression, the imperial regime does not seem to reject women like the free country... at least women do not have to fight for the right to vote, and even the female prime minister and the royal security minister. However, it is not a good time to think about the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry up. We still have a chance to land in Kengal, and then we have to escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their escape gave the last imperial empire to the final blow. After the emperor gave up on them, these people recalcited their weapons and their courage and honor in less than an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also means that Kengal’s third change of hands. According to Kengal, the Third Army of the Imperial Army and the Second Guard of the Royal Guards suffered more than 4,000 casualties and disappeared. More than 6,000 people were captured, and less than 4,000 people broke through. Three days after the remnant of the remnant, he joined the imperial Guards of the South, and he almost lost his fighting power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
