Jena<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***-***-***-***-***<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End of the door? When Captain Soledon woke up from a coma, the alarm outside the window was ringing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The different tonal screams and music alarms sang at the same time, which gathered into a noisy noise, and the sound source sounded no less than ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tangmen remembers that he worked overtime last night to restructure the alarm network. Before the Jena Blenheim double battle broke out, the warning network around Jena had a total of 160 alarm points; but last night he tried his best to piece together the manpower to maintain twenty-four alarm points. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Wait a minute, how many alarms are there now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still very painful, it is also dark in front of me. Below the body is the familiar touch of the military bed board, and he should be in a barracks somewhere. The residual effect of some kind of magic stays in the nervous system, afflicting his ability to think. After using three times more time than usual, he finally understood: now half of the alarm points in the entire camp are screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it done? What time is it? Are they getting out of jail?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Struggling to ask questions, the things in my head are still very chaotic. Namimen vaguely remembers that he brought a military uniform... a women's prisoner of war camp... action plan...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The difference is eleven o'clock."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the answer came from a very close place, a strange and reserved female voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eleven o'clock." He remembered, "Locating at Jena."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The door opened his eyes and smelled a strange smell. There was a slender hand that was waving in front of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, I can see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chair, sit up and come. He was originally wearing a purple, gorgeous military uniform, and he put the military uniform aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that he looked up, the hand was like being burned, slammed back, and there was no intention to make further contact with him. The owner of the hand had a pair of melancholy eyes, a long black hair, and a new blue free army uniform without a military rank. When he woke up, she let out a sigh of relief and showed a gentle smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks familiar, but due to the side effects of magic, the door can't remember who she is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you. That, you are...you are...who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The black-haired girl’s eyes flustered, and the black-eyed scorpion’s nephew stared at him. She had to tighten her legs to change a few different positions at an extremely fast speed, just as I didn't know where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was seen to be a little flustered. He noticed the necklace of the other party. The necklace was stringed up by the stars representing the gods: "Sorry, are you in the medical group? I definitely know you, but the magic makes me unable to remember for a moment..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-haired girl slammed her head down and wiped her face with her handcuffed hands, re-positioning her posture. The impeccable posture is proof that she has excellent education. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When seeing this sitting position, Nanimen remembered who the woman was in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not a medical group. It is not a guard. It is the first princess of the Holy Coman Empire, Olivia Hugh Coleman."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The feeling after changing your military uniform is very different. That is very, very beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ruthless defense, the reasons for thinking about it are said one by one. Come out. Ming knows that it is better to say nothing, he still said it in one article. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no expression on Olivia’s face. The world’s first princess, the younger sister, clenched her lower lip and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not very good at distinguishing other people's faces. Your temperament is too deep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There is no special effect magic to treat idiots. Naimen knows that this kind of inconsistent compliment is very bad, but he really does not know how to deal with this scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect you to go with them. Since you still have a third person..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The more you paint, the darker it is. Olia’s sitting posture was stiff and her hands crossed in front of her. Resist the door to notice that her fingernails had broken into her own flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just wants to beat himself: Even if she changes her military uniform, he shouldn’t recognize it! He didn't have to ask how the military uniform came from; since there is a third person, it is not surprising that they have any preparations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Why didn't you go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to ask. Should not ask. Should not ask. But the tongue is not controlled. He has a hunch that he is pulling the lead of the trap. A large magic trap that is enough to keep his bones free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why are you coming?" the princess asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is stunned. Not because of this problem, but because he was shocked to see two tears in Olia's black box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you are not coming for me. I also know that you don't even remember my looks. But I will still stay for you. Because- "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to these words, even if he is slow, I know that the situation is wrong now. All the clues are interspersed and the answer is obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is trying to discourage. Even if he knows that it will not work, he can only recite a new dialogue: "There should be no such exaggerated development. Don't cry. Don't cry, Princess Royal Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"- Even so, I will say,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olia took a deep breath and said the sentence: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the end of the door? Soledon first time in his life I heard this sentence. A fierce central breakthrough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This difficult problem. This kind of vulgar development. This is the worst case. How to deal with it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left the girl who was crying behind and fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door slammed up and slammed open the door, panting and fleeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door did not think of the princess of the empire So straightforward to say this sentence. This is not in his estimate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The missing clues are quickly pieced together in my mind. It was he who captured the princess. It was he who accompanied her when she was most lonely and helpless. It was he who took her first kiss - although it was unintentional. There should be no suitable objects at her side. He knows all, knowing it well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he never thought that the princess of the empire would really like him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naimen? Soledon is just a small person. After receiving the rewards he deserved after the end of the war, he retired. It was his life plan in the small magic shop in Lenni - and this life is obviously not suitable for the princess of the empire. What's more, the hero of the Free Army is the enemy of the empire. The imperial princess is on the top and is the hostage of the highest value in the hands of the Free Army. If Olia was abducted by a free soldier, Clade must have killed him... This is indeed a violation of the POW and military laws of both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he does not hate her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he and she can never have any results. No one will allow this result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would rather not know about it. This is the most embarrassing scene he has ever faced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not right. This is not right. It should not be like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stumbled Going out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lieutenant at the door is performing all the actions that should be in the "alert state": a strict military posture, a row of bullets with bullets on hand, at hand The siren on it, a row of stun potions and smoke bombs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this rigorous state shattered when the door appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the captain in a shirt and shorts escaping like a purple military uniform, the face of the lieutenant is so wonderful: "Why are you-"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not me, it’s their jailbreak!” Nanimen threw the sergeant’s military uniform on the table. “They changed clothes!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle of the leg is soft, the whole person falls to the chair: "You are joking..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Feng? Fagota Marquis and her accomplice planned. I need a military uniform to report this matter to the headquarters." Nana added, "This is my responsibility, I am too careless. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if you report this, I am finished." Lieutenant finally got over and found out a set of spare military uniforms. "However, what you mean." Is the Princess's Highness still?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door nodded. Lieutenant sighed "God bless" and hurried in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know how Oria would describe these things..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shake his head. This thought only turned around in his mind, and he was deliberately ignored. He put on his military uniform and set off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not toward the General Staff, but in the direction of the transmission point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated time is eleven o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows the importance of sending magic. It can transmit important people, transmit key items, launch assaults, and unwind, which is one of the core issues of the magic strategy. The earliest transmission of magic was purely a gamble. People risked turning into stone statues, crossing different worlds, or losing half their bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other end of the space channel is undetectable darkness. Euclid said that there must be a positioning point, and the world will be bright. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Age of Elven Empire, the magicians used the geometry and mapping of the Great Arcane Euclide to build a huge transmission system, but this transmission system and The Elven Avenue connecting the empire was lost in the dark ages. The new short-distance transmission technology appeared with the analytic geometry of Descartes in 1637, but it was not fully operational in the practical stage because of the high risk. Only the crazy new master of Sid-Nasser would use this spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today's anchor technology is completely for war. As the front changes and the base shifts, the senior mages of the Empire and the Free Army continue to build and dismantle the transfer points in key locations. The coordinates of the positioning points of Lennie and DeLand kept moving, and the few places that changed hands like Jena were not played by the spell team of both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistance recalls the current location of the anchor. The anchor point is indeed located in the opposite direction of the prisoner of war camp, in front of a clock tower in the southeast of the city. In order to transmit Confucius, Marshal Fox, today's startup language has definitely been replaced. At this time, the tester should have tested the validity of the transmission, and lost all the chickens, pigs, and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stand up! Soldiers over there, password!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door slowly raised his hands: "The password is 'green" Brandi. Although not The rank, I am --"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his face, the two guards glimpsed and immediately saluted the military ceremony: "Captain Soleilton! Lord Marshal Let you report to him as soon as you arrive here! He is in the bell tower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord Marshal?" Resist the subconscious and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard on the left replied casually: "You came earlier than your order. He said that you will arrive after eleven o'clock. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door did not follow up, smiled and scratched his head and walked into the bell tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who waited for him was not Fox, but Clade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Krad is alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new marshal stood in the shadow and looked at the defense map near Jena. Push pins of different colors are inserted on the defense map to mark the alarm position that is reverberating. These alarm positions were hand-picked by the door, and he discovered the mystery at a glance: as long as they were close to the large-scale prisoner of war camp, they were all unplugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you wouldn't come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorkeeper took off the military cap: "Everyone has something they don't want to do. I am still here, sir. Please dispose of me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crad did not look up, just on the map A new pushpin was pressed: "But she is not with you. It is her own arbitrary action, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much does he know? Naimeng measured Clade's reasoning and replied: "Yes. It is an armed escape, she has her own plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krad stopped the action. His inference was accurate and rapid, and his fingers stopped at the position of the clock tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But if you come here, you will prove that she knows there are anchors. Have you brought the information, or told her directly?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The data was taken away." Ningmen replied that he did not want to reveal too much information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so too. From the point of view of the map, their intention is to wait for the opportunity to incite the prisoners uprising." Clad looked at the map and drew a few pictures on the map. In the circle, several prison camps were marked. "It's not that easy. Her adjutant 'Fog Eagle' and all the important officer officers are under the control of our superior forces."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is mindful: "If we only keep the minimum strength, we can guarantee that each prisoner of war camp has superior strength. Then their uprising is tantamount to suicide."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, her intention is not a prisoner of war camp." Clad finally raised his head. "Take my main force first, then use this transfer point to leave. This is your plan, Soleil.上上尉?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is holding the breath. The eyes of the middle-aged marshal can almost penetrate everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bells rang slowly over their heads. One sound, two sounds, until eleven sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Plan. Who's planning?" Nana answered slowly. "You gave me the order. You want them to come here. This is Your plan, Lord Marshal. I don't understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not understand. Why is Clade so obsessed with dealing with his daughter? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you don't understand, faith is power." Klad replied thoughtfully. "As long as I am here, she and Olia will not." It is possible to cross the transfer point of Lenny."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of the door twitched: "Yes. But you are so sure, is this her plan?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unless they both want to fight with me in the open field." Clad’s right wrist trembled, a light blue little sword tied to the map. Above, "11:30. If they have not appeared yet, I will leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know something that you don't know yet. We all know that Seneca has an accomplice. Now you know that the accomplice is not me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Raise your head, boldly step forward and walk to the map. Finger-resistant fingers crossed the map and made two arrows to the south and west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, the accomplice is not the Royal Highness Princess Oria, she is still in the prison camp." Because Olia just confessed to me, the door is in my heart. Added, "That is at least a medium-level master. We should have a list of doubts--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two look directly at each other. Clade Lopez straightened up, took back his weapon and put on a military cap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door does not back down: "You know who might be in that list. Someone who needs your own shot."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I know. For example, Nasser or Rasta." Clad went out the door. "Fortunately, they have few choices. In the Eastern proverb, this is called smart." Clever mistakes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is looking down at the map. Only the last guard tower with no pushpins left on the map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He chased the door. Outside the door is the transfer of the hole, Marshal Fox and his entourage. The old marshal is looking at the sky and waving to Clade's back. The magic officer responsible for the transmission is reading the starter, and he can hear that it is "a flag of freedom, flying for a long time." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinica still didn't come here. He was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer is complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warning tower on the southwest side of Jena was The fireball was ignited and the alarm above the sound rang. This alarm is a piano piece with a loud volume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After four casualties, the class responsible for vigilance has collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the thirteenth alert group."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonyka is getting closer and softer The duty officer on the ground took the lieutenant rank from the shoulder of the loser and changed it to the shoulder of his military uniform. This is not the blue military uniform, but a red military uniform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggie ya? Veri wore a green sergeant suit and drew a big fork on the ground with his feet: "There should be three more in Minggang. It’s all dark whistle.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, leave the three northeast no hits." Renee answered, "We are going now. West evacuation. Now he should think that we are going to transfer points or flee from the south of the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly wait." Maggie yavi? Asked, "Before the official battle, I must understand our enemy. I have to tell you about your father's intelligence. This man's combat power is not weaker than Sid? Nasser, and he is as magical as Sid. There are too many secrets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 took the seized cap and took the step. The entire camp has begun to confuse, and often see the running officers, they are not conspicuous in the mix. She nodded thoughtfully: "This is a long story."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard rumors about him when I was in Kengler. He graduated from the first subject of the military academy, studied Dongyi magic, and got the golden emblem of the magician when he was young. He should be the most powerful mage in the Jena theater in the absence of Sid Nasser. If he is serious about killing us, we can't escape. I remember that the newspaper said that there is an activation weapon that can automatically track and fight automatically."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "About 'Flying Sword', I think I know more than you know." Renee answered. "That is not activating weapons. It is a soul sharing. Remember the artillery battle of yesterday? Imagine, so many The firepower is concentrated on one person. The light blue light, each road is equivalent to a magic missile, hundreds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggie looks back carefully : "It's light blue. I saw it in yesterday's battle... 黛妮卡. Is that light?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He found me. Stealth! Distracting action!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 pushed the Maggie and pushed her head in the opposite direction. The green-haired woman in the form of a soul lowered the cap and ran into the shadows, disappearing without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light blue rays in the air gradually began to gather, gather, gather, and finally turned into a dazzling pure blue light, catching up and surpassing Nika, Falling to the corner at the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 did not hesitate to release a shock magic to the building at the corner. The house made a loud roar and collapsed halfway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is more than the power of this magic. You have made progress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Renee stopped and listened to the sound coming from the wall. Clade walked leisurely through the collapsed house, and the flying sword "broken dreams" surrounded him, forming a dense blue light net, blocking the spattered gravel, and the low crash sound continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sneak peek. She sighed and spoke intently: "The great, great, glorious Freedom Marshal Clade Lopez. Are you satisfied now? You can finally save the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Senikan. Where is your companion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cradd stopped at her distance of more than twenty steps Step down. Yanika pulled back a few steps and the middle-aged did not keep up. For him, this distance is no different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't tell you for the time being." Renee smiled. "Tell you, this conversation is coming to an end. I haven't seen each other for so long." Don't want to talk about it first? I thought you would come before Soledon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marshal right hand pressed and took the flying sword back: "You Since you have chosen the road, you have to pay the price. Everyone has to pay for his choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I am also your price. You need to kill by hand. Die me, Clade. Soledon doesn't know why. I know." Renee is silently gathering magic. "The Empire Collection's Dongyi magic book is more than Brenny. They have a very good royal library. I realized there that you can't be a true Taoist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"People who practice the Taoism need 'inaction.' In the great powers of the East, they will stay away from secular politics and military in order to reach a higher level of magic. And you completely do not follow You are not a Taoist in these practices. You only want authority and victory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are actually a Confucian, right? With the confusing method, the 'right way' of Dongyi magic. Although you have never shown it, it is your core magic. Relying on learning The morality of morality and the heart of the attempt. The flying sword is nothing but a cover-up. It is a pure soul-connected weapon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krader nodded: "If you put These circumstances bring to the Imperial court mages, it should bring a lot of advantages. Is your partner still nearby?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I have never Said to them.” Renee continued to delay time. “You must be faithful to your beliefs and magic. You can't let me go because it will cause you to lose power. In the system of Confucianism, all this is done. If you can't handle the affairs of the family, you can't govern the country, you can't save the world. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kradd nodded. "Not bad, 黛妮卡. Have you read that 'great study'? The Royal Library is doing a good job." ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The matter is then known, and the meaning is sincere, sincere and sincere, the heart is correct and the body is repaired. After the Qi and then the rule of the country, the rule of the country and then the world. You have probably reached the point of ruling the country or the world, Clade. In order to maintain this level, you have helped me arrange the position in your script. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a script. You have gone too far, Seneca. Look at the blood in your hand. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say a little more, I don’t know a little more. She said to herself in her heart, to be eloquent. Power is accumulating on both hands, the little finger, the ring finger, the middle finger. Careful precision operation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I don't want to sacrifice for your career, Lord Marshal. Even if my strength is only one tenth of yours, I will resist the last. I Not 'a daughter of Lopez'! Even if I die here, the empire will win. They will leave a record like this: the one who died here is Jonica Vernon von Figota, for the ultimate victory. The quasi-Marquis who volunteered to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crad is serious. He evokes all the light spots, and the light on the flying sword is getting brighter and brighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are delaying the time. You have specifically brought me here. Delay the time and cover your partner. You are constantly changing clothes to confuse me. The line of sight, let me think that you only have two people -" Clade stared at her eyes, "- or more than two people? Is that a goal that will make you give up your life and hope?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you use your real magic? Kill me with the great Dongyi magic that you rely on to become 'Ruo Ruide'. Good things, sincerity, self-cultivation Let's take a look at it. Let's take a look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, 黛妮卡, that's it. Let him indulge in the strategic reasoning of the East way. Let him be suspicious. Let him stay behind enough. Left thumb, right thumb, left index finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will confess, 黛妮卡. I still remember that when you were a child, you were not very good at lying." Clad suddenly laughed. "Nothing is too great." Conspiracy, right? Even if your partner is Sid Nath, he can't do anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal's right hand rises, "broken dream" shines Stinging. The blue light twisted into a spiral and aimed at the eyes of Seneca. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on. Even if this is a destiny, I will reverse it to you! Even if this is your script, I will use impromptu performances. To change the ending!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She narrowed her eyes and looked at the brightest spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more languages. Only action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Broken Dream" turned into a tens of thousands of threads intertwined and flew to her eyes. It is as dense as the silk of the East, just as sharp as the dragon's rifle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"purengergyflame!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡判读了克拉德飞The path of the sword. She has been doing this and all her energy has been used for interpretation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no conspiracy, and there was no plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without defeating her father, she has no freedom. She is so determined, so she does not need any plans at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is this. What she is waiting for is the moment when the "broken dream" appears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is more than just daughter of Clade. She is also an apprentice to Alchemist Reza Hermont. She has seen another flying sword and she knows how to break it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the real magical power of Clade Lopez, just the magic weapon he controls. The magic she will be afraid of is less than one-tenth of Clade, but she is confident that she can break the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl raises her right hand. The first pure energy flame is the right hand little finger, then the ring finger, middle finger, thumb, index finger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a smile on Clarke’s face. His smile seems to say "Do you think that you can stop my flying sword with five pure flames?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is really no stopping. The flying sword is only slightly slow, but still firmly flies to the face of Yanika. The fast debris has already passed her hair and passed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not finished yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said to herself in her heart. Flat left hand, left hand little finger, then ring finger, middle finger, thumb, index finger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is left is the blue sword itself, and the sword begins to crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile on Clade’s face was slightly flat, but the corner of his mouth was still ridiculously raised. Renee interpreted it as "Can you still use your feet to put magic?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really not. But it is ** from now on, she thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She uses the least efficient magic ever, pure energy. Most magic is the science of using levers and pivots to incite reality. Pure energy is the stupid effort to challenge the basic laws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since the night of Lenny, I have known that I am a true genius in magic capacity. She didn't know what kind of offensive would be effective for Dongyi Magic, but she knew that Pure Energy would be effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ten fingers are slightly bent, and the silver light is on again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All her magic is gathered on her hands and gathered into a gun that concentrates all anger and will - in fact, not every finger has a pure Can flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but every knuckle has gathered a pure energy flame! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she only needs so much time. I have two hands on my face, and there are twenty-eight pure energy flames! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reveals a smile that she believes represents "who will let you assess the possibility of so many tricks, and then leave so much magic?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then stretch your hands forward at the same time. Ten silver rays are shot side by side, hitting the blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue light stopped and disappeared, leaving only the sword still flying. She heard that Clade coughed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is close at hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡have clenched his fists with both hands, and joined the middle with both hands, blocking the face with both hands. Her thumb clasped the remaining fingers one by one and popped the last few shots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little finger of the right hand. The ring finger of the left and right hands. The middle finger of the left and right hands. The index finger of the left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Broken Dream" is broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fascinating streamer turns into a deep blue meteor and turns into a dull dozens of pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bowed her head slightly, bearing the frontal debris rain and wind pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fragment of "Broken Dream" wiped her face, plunged into the back of her hand, scratching her skin and penetrating her shoulder. The clothes were cut through dozens of mouths by the sword, and behind each crack, blood was flowing out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don't care. She rushed up with the sword's fragments: she knew that the opposite of Clade's injury would be heavier and more thorough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the magic of the soul connection, whether it is summoning magic or making magic, has great risks. For example, when Silver Dragon Mara destroyed the incarnation of the demon, she must have caused a serious injury to her master; the same is true of Clade's flying sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, even if he is seriously injured, Klad can desperately kill her. As long as he has real strength, it is not difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s not going to happen. Clade thinks her partner is Sid Nasse, so in the moment when the Flying Sword breaks, he will start the spell of emergency escape and disappear into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cao Cao's arbitrary door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this spell, Renee stuck out Right hand, the last shot, the pure energy flame on the third section of the index finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klad’s captain’s cap was blown by this silver flame, flying in the sky, and I disappeared without a trace. Renee ran a few steps forward and jumped to grab the hat of the Free Marshal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
