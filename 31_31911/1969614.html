			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xi<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual December 25th is the main festival of the Orthodox Church and the New Church. ―God’s Day. This festival was established to commemorate the second Taranto Conference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was on the evening of December 24, 322. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishops who ended the chaotic agenda of another day returned to their respective sects to rest, discuss the doctrine, and carry out metaphysical speculation. During the daytime meeting, due to the mediation of Emperor Klein and Tiortstein, the bishops of the East were finally prepared to accept the conditions of Hong Linusti, to make those separatist factions a heresy, and decided to formally the next day. Sign the meeting decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that night. Just as all the factions had prayed to eat, there were twelve supervised bishops and the right bishops standing up from their respective tables, and they marched toward the center of the deserted Taranto Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people called their names in amazement, but did not receive any response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These clergymen, like the devil, came to the center of the temple, and went to the front of a god, and solemnly squatted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are twelve new red robes waiting for them, with purple sacred lights on the edges. Hundreds of bishops and priests followed them, and they all heard the voice of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People! You have reached the moment of choice! Are you succumbing to expel your companions again, or choose to get up and fight with righteousness?!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, all the Eastern Governors chose to refuse to sign the "Second Taranto Conference Resolution" and stated that they broke with the Grand Duke Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twelve bishops who heard the grace of God wrote the "Draft of the Gods" on this day according to God's will, resulting in endless continuation An orthodox covenant church that affects the millennial history of later generations. In the following history, this church will make the earth tremble...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this incident was later questioned by many historians and is an undeniable fact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, when did they decide to start eating Flamingo? No, in the era of signing the covenant, is there really an animal like Firebird?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the knowledge about Shennar, the young lieutenant who stood at the gate of the fortress to clear the number of flamingos thought angrily. What kind of fat and fleshy large poultry was turned into a standing food for Shennian? And... why is this thing called "firebrid"? Although this thing does "spitfire"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lieutenant Soledon, here is the collection of the eleventh for the eleventh fortress, it has been counted Finished, please post!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flamingo filled with hundreds of iron cages and bamboo cages swayed in front of his eyes, rolling and faint Sulfur taste. Firebirds are not going to spurt like their distant relatives, the phoenix, but they also have fire sacs. The soldiers carried these khaki and gray poultry and went out on the road to the fortress to distribute the birds to the various zones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only one hundred and fifty? Is the task not two hundred and thirty? And, is this average price?" He glanced at the money figure and had some resistance to the door. Asked strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, we ran four or five villages and bought this. The villagers said that this year the Northern Laws had a poor harvest, and the Palo people came over a few days ago. Shennao and a large number of acquisitions, we are late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I will write it in the report. I am going to the South Bank Fortress to see the South. The garrison's harvest, if possible, adjusts some of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door; Soleton signed the paper and covered the logistics assistant of the staff headquarters. The seal also shouted: "I will go to the South Bank first. You will leave a few soldiers here. If there are other people coming back, inform them to send the flamingos to the outer fort, so that the South Bank will be convenient to deploy. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is clearly the first day of the New Year holiday... He has been busy from now to the present. The logistics work has always been heavy, and it is even worse to count this "Special Supply of God's Day". The staff department should have a logistics department below, but this logistics department was completely trapped in Lenny; the fortress was originally a logistics department, but this logistics department was not prepared for a freelancer of 12,000 people. I have to draw ten fortress companies to take care of these extra forages and luxury goods collection...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there is a million army that does not need to replenish Is it responsible for collecting the 'direct lieutenant' of the roasting flamingo?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vessel responsible for traffic between the South Bank and the North Shore has not yet returned. He sighed and sat down on the rest chair, glaring at the battle-like and legendary novels that were swaying like ghosts. However, from a rational point of view, he knows that no matter what kind of troops will not get rid of the logistics nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lieutenant, it’s best to find a quiet place next time complaining about work. As the saying goes, 'Do not complain about the work and the soldiers of the boss are not good soldiers', but let the boss listen It’s not the same. Is the work going smoothly?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cold-like silence makes the young lieutenant’s goose bumps, this voice he never I will get it wrong. How did he not notice this person just now? There is only one person in the Fortress Fortress that can make everyone feel scared: the gendarmerie captain Sain; Major Constance, the emblem of the "whip and sharp blade" on his armband always makes both the enemy and the enemy very chilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Alright. Busy dinner tonight, there is still a difference in quantity..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't care about your Firebird, that thing has nothing to do with the gendarmerie." Cyan went straight to the subject. "I have been thinking about your report last night. Does that person really do nothing?" The empire has a lot of magic that we don't know yet. Has he ever done anything suspicious or strange?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still coming. It seems that the "illegitimate child" Rasta did not do anything after it, but it caused the suspicion of the anti-spyware veteran of Thain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me think about it... From my point of view, he doesn't seem to have any special behavior, and there is no reaction in detecting magic. And..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to ask about the "fog eagle"? The boy hesitated, still did not dare to speak. This topic is too easy to recruit Cheyenne; Constance's doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...He has repeatedly mentioned that he wants to marry Marshal Govara as soon as possible to complete his mission. I have at least three impressions. Maybe he really Just a special envoy who doesn't want to get into trouble?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the judgment of Lieutenant, Major Cheyenne sneered coldly: "Impossible. I am at the headquarters." After 13 years as a deputy gendarmerie, I instinctively told me that this person must have a special mission. When you and Itis are on duty tonight, you can give him some freedom to see if he will show his feet." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trapping? Resist the door and take a breath. To say trapping... Is it possible to trap himself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a command?" he asked, lowering his voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Verbal command, I will remember, but will not be responsible. Carefully." Cheyenne; Constance stood up from the chair, "The ferry is coming. Go and do your own thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door; Soleton. Major Cairn actually came to him specifically? There seems to be something wrong with this... He suddenly understood the deeper meaning of this order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This command means to quietly find a handle to send him back? Is this the order of Marshal Govar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gendarmerie captain stopped and said: "According to your own understanding, to execute this order for the national interest. The same order will be sent to Captain Itis, this is the highest Confidential."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of this sentence is translated as "default" - but he did not say who the order is. If something goes wrong, it is obvious that he and Isis are responsible...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also has a few cards to choose from - because no one knows how many people he is ordered, and no one knows which side he will choose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even he himself does not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that Firebird is in place is only the first step. The planned 1,100 firebirds finally got together under the efforts of the logistics of the South Wing Fortress, and there was a slight surplus - but time has come to the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the count is correct, Naimen will follow the last batch of firebirds and return to the North Shore by boat, ready to report the results to the Central Conference Hall. The inland river fleet that went out to patrol has already been ported, and now the capacity on both sides of the South and the North is sufficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire Fort Vatican is 12,000 troops, and more than half of them are in the North Shore Fortress. The central training ground of the North Shore Fortress was arranged into a central venue that can accommodate 3,000 people. The tenth division remnants and the officers and men who stayed here from DeLand will spend the eve of Shennian Festival here. Responsible for the layout of the 3,000-person conference hall is the second staff member Peter; Major Cousin. Everyone in the staff knows that the transactional work must not be called Ega, the highest person in charge of the singer; the Lieutenant Colonel Eugen is doing it - it is enough to imagine the scene of white gum residue on the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Carefully transport, do not loosen the strips that tie their mouths!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Six Classes, 7 classes, and 8 classes each send 50 to three venues!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Transfer, go to the South Command and ask for a fortress Come over, if the table is not enough, move to the staff!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The tables over there are moving away and making room for the shooting contest!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Cousson directed three of the nearly 400 people who were setting up the venue, while also remotely controlling the layout of the other three defense zones in the North Shore Fortress. His figure shuttled through all corners of the venue, and he controlled everything in an orderly manner. It seems that even if the matter is several times more, he can't make him mess. Nameng admired with admiration and walked over and handed the report to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Major Cousson, all the firebirds, hams and sausages are in place for the dinner tonight, here is the final report."<br /><br /> Peter; Cousin took the report, glanced at it, and threw it back to him: "The number of firebirds and accounts are not right. Check the final total number, the difference is twenty. There is also a problem. This morning, the four guards in the North Wing have strengthened an infantry company. You didn’t count the numbers.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going back to the report and listing the calculations for three minutes, I reluctantly admit that I was wrong. He will re-submit the revised report to the sergeant, gazing unnaturally to one side, staring at the poles that are standing on the field not far away. The poles stood erected there, looking very eye-catching, as if they had just been installed today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, this time the number is right." Major Cousson signed the report on the report. "Go to the staff. Yes, you are tonight. Also sign up for the Flamingo Contest? Keep a little bit of spirit, and if it's not enough magic, it will be ugly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Firebird Contest?" Asked reflexively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah? Haven’t you played?" The major seemed quite surprised. "Isn’t this the annual Pentecost must be held? You used to be defensive. Didn't the teacher play?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That, I have been in the military for more than a year. Last year, Shenneng also invited a holiday home..." I hope that the major will not be suspicious. Fortunately, Major Cousson did not really doubt, but helped the glasses and began to seriously explain the tradition to the traditional entertainment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know why Firebirds are welcomed by military personnel? Or do you know the history of poultry such as Firebird?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Soledon shook his head hard, Cousson continued. "Because this magical poultry does not need to be specially fired, it can be cooked. Their distant relatives are said to be some kind of fire-breathing and resurrection. The dangerous birds, originally intended to be tamed by air force... did not expect to be domesticated into meat animals. Although most of the firebirds are not like the ancestors of their ancestors, the fire sac is still there; Try to ignite the fire sacs of their chests, the flames will burn inside the flamingo's digestive tract, and finally roast yourself. The flamingo is at a great distance, using flame magic, rockets or something that will produce high heat. Hit their fire sacs... understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major screamed: "Of course! How else do we score? In the Flamingo contest, the first person to hit the fire sac, let these guys spurt the fire, we are victorious. We have prepared a lot of projects, but Traditionally, the direct staff of the General Staff Department all sent people to participate. In the competition at the headquarters of Lenny, we have won more than half of the projects in the year round!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Project?" Soledon came to interest. The boys of this age are very good at winning, and they will be excited when they hear the winner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, according to the traditional project there should be six: men’s wrestling score, women’s wrestling score, physical sniper, unrestricted sniper, throwing sniper Firebird guards the team competition. Which one do you want to attend? I ordered the throwing sniper, and everyone in the guard team competition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The resistance to the question continues: "Score? Sniper? Guard game?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major helped the glasses: "Ah, the score is the competition. The player uses the specified weapon to ignite the flamingo within the site, igniting the most numerous people to win, while the sniper is the flamingo that ignites the typhoon tied to the pillars at a certain distance. As for the guard team, it is Assign five flamingos to the teams, first ignite the opponent's flamingoes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, I have a question. Call these When the flamingo, the flamingo..." Narenton paused, "...still alive? They are playing live Firebird "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"?. Of course, the killing of the contest also how ah "Courson major ramp at him?. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young lieutenant took a sigh of relief, his lips squirming, and whispered to himself: "Good savage..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A touch of cold light was swept from the lens of Major Coulson. "Wait a minute, you said that this has a long tradition of savage activities? You are insulting a great tradition, Lieutenant! You have not studied history classes about firebirds at the military academy? How did you go to class?! Let me give you Make up this lesson in order to understand the glorious tradition of the Free Army..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is resistant; Soledon is as big as a fight. He finally understood Peter; the essence of Cousin: he is a serious man who is a good teacher. His legendary historical narrative can be summarized as follows:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the night of a Shennong festival more than a hundred years ago, an insurgent army collected the only supplies. It is a firebird. Their scheduled sneak attack plan made them dare not stop to camp and set fire, so they spent the night with the "self-cooking" characteristics of the firebird itself - and successfully won the heavy town of Kengler. They succeeded in cutting off the reinforcements and logistics of the Emperor, and the empire's intervening forces were not able to return - so they decided to use the Flamingo Contest as a tradition in the Free Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...and you dare to say this traditional barbarism?!" The major took a glass of water from the table next to it and drank it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, yes, I don't dare anymore... I signed up for the men's wrestling scores." Nike quickly made the decision: now the best The decision was to shift the serious attention of the major. "I have to go to the report first, and I have lost it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Cousin frowned: "Now Graduates...唉. The times are really different.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton pretended not to hear the stern’s complaints – he didn’t want to add more flaws . In retrospect, in his eighteen years of life, he did not even know that flamingos can cook directly by attacking the fire sac...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is Because the nuns and 黛nica are strongly opposed to this "barbarians" approach. Every year, Shennian Festival, even if the financial status of the welfare home allows, they can only eat firebirds that are roasted according to common practices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, a strong homesickness floats on the mind of the teenager. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to go home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not know how the family is now? Maybe it’s time to send a letter back... or else they think he’s dead? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is true, don't you know if I will cry for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
