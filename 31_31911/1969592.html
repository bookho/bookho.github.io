His gaze seemed to be drawn by something, nailed to the smile, and could no longer be moved. He noticed with the light that not only his eyes were nailed to this person, but the eyes of everyone on the field were nailed to him. From the elderly to the children, from men to women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not right... totally wrong. He smothered the bottle of holy water that he intended to sterilize for others, and used his willpower to fight against the mysterious force, trying to turn his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow your own will. Do what you want to do. Do what you think is right. He should be an amazing person, and he can't be controlled by such people here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such an idea conflicts in the mind of a teenager, but cannot break the shackles. His pupil is still fixed, only looking at the smile of that person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? Is my life really like this... no hope? Is it true... will it be impossible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The negative pessimistic feelings of self-pity are uncontrollably rising from the bottom of my heart. He only feels a flower in front of him and can no longer think of anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton looked at the man and took off his hood, only to find that he was a very handsome and elegant young boy - but this is no longer for him. significance. He seemed to hear what the man said, but he couldn't understand what it meant; all he knew was that he should do it according to those very reasonable words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are all kind citizens, eager for a peaceful life. But, have you heard that song? That angry song! Evil army Killing the people, you must use your power to stop them! In this fight, it will bring peace to you! Use your flesh and blood to block the atrocities of the steel monsters!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bringing peace..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bringing peace..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people repeated the words of the beautiful boy, stood up and gathered around him. People and people are pushing and surging, like a large group of untargeted ants. Soledon was also among them, slowly moving forward. By his side, there were those who had beaten him, the monks who had those churches, those who had once shouted over the longevity of the Savior, and even the coups who had just killed the citizens. However, the juvenile has already been unaware of this because he has been controlled by the bright future of peace...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You guys! Actually here The sacred land uses the magic of charm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the voice of anger sounded in the crowd! The old priest, who is not amazing, has resisted this powerful awe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Never sleep, photophobia!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He struggled to throw the holy water bottle in his hand , thrown at the vampire. Seeing that it was about to be thrown, suddenly a figure came forward, just between the holy water and the beautiful boy. The fragile holy water bottle burst into contact with him, pouring the holy water into the person - but it did not produce any effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old pastor was taken aback: "You are not an undead?! Why help..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Because I am the 'first tax official'." The unspeakable man replied, pulling out a new long sword shining from the waist. The priest saw it and hurriedly tried to counterattack with magic, but was attacked by a burst of fatigue - just now, he used too much healing magic, so that he had no spare force to resist the sword. The "first tax official" stepped forward and a sword pierced the heart of the old pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man clasped his sword with his hand and seemed to refuse to fall down and refused to admit this reality. The tax official squinted at him and pulled out the sword; the old man’s weak body still did not fall. He slammed his feet impatiently, and the old man’s body crashed into the ground, with unwillingness and anger in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blocking the peace of the dead..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blocking the peace of the dead..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are low The voice repeated, stepping on the past from the body and blood of the old pastor. The white priest's robes were stained with blood and trampled into black and red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene is all in the eye of Solitaire. The teenager’s shoulder trembled uncontrollably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are confused, do it according to the thoughts of your heart. Don't care about other people's opinions, do what you can do."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the old man echoed in his mind a little, calling him back from that nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I...no...can...in...here...just give in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I...can't...here... yielding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't... give in here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't give in here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- In this world, the spirit determines the power. If a person has a strong enough spirit, has a firm belief, and insists on his independent thinking, he will never be influenced by others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soleton continues to follow the crowd, go forward, go forward, with his own will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hesitated when he walked to the old priest’s body, but he stepped on it, with his own will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry. The teenager apologized to the old man in his heart and clenched the holy water bottle in his hand, with his own will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd squirmed and walked out of the Cathedral of Fatila and walked up the street. A similar large group of people is concentrated on almost all of Rennie's main roads; if they are called by politicians, they will probably be crowned with the name "50,000 people anti-war demonstrations." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton squeezed cautiously into the crowd and slowly approached the two. Soon, he can hear their conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many more roads can pass, the second wing of the left wing?" The first tax official asked his companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are two more, all the roads leading to the east are blocked. The north is also ready, as long as the order is reached, you can start acting at any time... ..." The beautiful young vampire, code-named "The Second Knight of the Left," calculated the calculation. "With the number of people here, you can almost completely block the enemy. However, will this plan be too much publicity? Is it necessary?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the direct command of 'Wang'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they are talking, Suddenly, a sacred wave of volatility came from nearby. The vampire was a little surprised, and he stepped back two steps and the words were interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the name of the covenant, would you bother to sleep?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very beautiful brunette The priest, who is in the authentic Delan, reads the exorcism of the Orthodox Church. Soledon recognized that she was one of several adventurers he had encountered in the hotel before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect that in the capital of the South, undead creatures were allowed to sneak in the streets. Is there still Wang Fa?" Of course, her companions It is next to it. The handsome knight wearing a shiny lock has pulled out his sword and pointed to the "tax officials" and "knights" in the crowd center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The South should have no royal law, they use federal law." A burly middle-aged reminded that he was wearing a striking priest's robe . He swayed his hand and threw a therapeutic ray - a deadly killing ray for undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All concentrated, dense array!" The vampire hurriedly raised his hand and ordered the crowd to move closer to him. People immediately obediently concentrated and moved closer to him; the treatment beam hit the crowd, flicked a few times, disappeared without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice just fell, and the crowd controlled by the fear of magic suddenly fell a large piece and made a road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fast, knockdown, enough." Knock down their teenager, holding a magic stick with a flash of light in his hand. He only said three words, and once again broke into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the situation is not good, the beautiful young vampire calls out his blood servants: "Block them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Jumping out of the crowd of several beautiful teenagers, holding a unique sword in their hands, dressed in glamorous, exceptionally dazzling. In their eyes, the same red awns are shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing so many beautiful teenagers, the female priest of the beautiful god Musika was flushed and hurriedly reminded the knight who was in charge: "Xu Lan!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know it." The knight named Shulan was a little helpless to put away the sword. "I don't need weapons."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that he had put away his weapons, the beautiful bloody servants of the eyes were rushing forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next minute, Soleton looked silly and didn't even stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight’s movement can only be described as “quickly ghostly”. His figure flashed between the blood servants, avoiding the tip of the sword with incredible movements, and unloading their wrists and shoulders with wonderful fighting action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood servants are not ordinary humans, they have more powerful power than humans; but these beautiful teenagers with strong wrists, in front of this knight, are like no The lamb of resistance. The bones of the bones and the dislocation of the joints continued one after another. It took only one minute, and all the stabbing swords were unable to fall underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good skills." The new first tax official also stopped. "It seems that without stopping, it is impossible to move on. Knight, You step up to complete the task, hand it over to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave them both!" The dark-haired female pastor pointed at the beautiful teenager in the distance, screaming Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can do it." This unsmiling man slammed his hand, and the ghosts shrouded the entire street, the street The body slowly stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The Necromancer." The burly middle-aged man's pupil contracted, and he pulled the hammer from the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About at the same time, in the East District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel forged gun car rolled forward along the blue brick avenue, and the track pressed the ground and made a creaking sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 6-pound lead pellets with a sense of oppression fired from time to time, sweeping the enemy's weak counterattack. Unlike ordinary artillery, the gun that has good protection for the gunner can be said to be a weapon that is very suitable for street fighting. Even a strong street defense position can not withstand the continuous bombardment of artillery. The coup army tried several times to build a temporary defensive position to stabilize the situation, but all were easily broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been a soldier for more than ten years in my life, and I have never played such a relaxed embarrassment. Just follow the gun and search for the fish." It is too easy to win." A veteran of the guard row sighed and followed the team to clean the empty streets after the chariot passed. It is said that it is cleaning, in fact, no enemy can be found; the mercenaries of the coup army are mad and retreat to the east, no one wants to stay behind the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s as if you’ve played hard before.” The young company commander smiled. “You’re only 40 years old, how could you experience it? Last time the war?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I sent back from the intercontinental army and participated in the Kibak defensive battle six years ago. That battle became In the street fighting, we and the pirates and the pirates joined the army in a bloody battle, and they fought for two weeks before surrendering." The veteran explained, "If there were such weapons at that time, we would not have to surrender... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not necessarily, the most important thing is that it should be morale. If the other party really has the heart to resist the street, the civilians will be used as a barrier, and we will have insufficient strength. Can't win by gunboat..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have entered the melee. Is it an ambush?" The company chief hurried forward with the question of the fact that "the artillery did not fire." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What appeared in front of his eyes was an incredible scene. Hundreds of civilians with different eyes, mixed with the same eyes, released the light of the coup army soldiers, holding a mess of non-standard weapons in their hands, forming a dense square array of people, advancing toward his team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, ask for permission to fire!" The dwarf gunner poked his head out of the gun, loudly, "Otherwise the troops could not move forward!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company commander bites his lips and bites into the blood. Want to fire? Don't fire? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! If we fire, do we not become coups? Spiritual control cannot be far away, all members retreat, stop unnecessary. Fighting, reorganizing into a wide area!" His hand was heavily waved in the air, "returning the command--the 7th company was blocked by civilians, unable to move forward, had to stop chasing and retracing on the spot! In addition, apply for magic support ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar return does not happen in one place; the bad news is constantly being aggregated into the hands of the interim commander Hull in front of the parliament building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The 7th company is blocked by the crowd, stop moving forward! Requesting support!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The 9-inch gun fell into the pit and could not be launched. The 9th company requested support!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The 4th car was melted by unknown magic, and all the occupants died!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One red cross is marked on the map with the arrival of the new report, forming a large semicircle. All the companies stopped at the edge of the semicircle, leaving the east side of the city to the coup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, it’s not the time to celebrate the victory. Did she have long estimated that the enemy will have a counterattack?" Think of the advice of the female vampire hunter who just left, Major Hull had no choice but to smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sir, the general wants you to head to the Freedom Square." Another commander ran into the parliament hall and reported. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand." Hull took up military maps and notes, and took all the personnel of the temporary headquarters out of the "Independence and United Gate", flooding this The place where death and rancid breath are left behind. He did not return at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunshots are getting thinner and stop. Even the fire in the city was extinguished everywhere. The Supreme Commander of the rebel army, which is reorganizing the army, stopped and listened, and his guards stopped together. At that time they were leaving - or, in other words, before the Supreme Court of the three districts of Lenni, it was a 180-year-old building that represented justice. The company that was sent to occupy the area was watching their wolf superiors in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s unbelievable, the Lopez Army, which has just advanced rapidly, has indeed stopped pursuing. Is the plan exhausted? Or did the suppression army start the fire? Or, are there other forces that prevent their progress? The marshal and the general will look at each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a good opportunity. Reorganize the troops and prepare for the fifth attempt." Marshal Govar ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reorganization? You, you mean, rely on this force?" Di Khao; Lemda looked around for the defeat of the four sides. One more point, plus the court's guards, barely two companies, less than three hundred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We may have an opportunity. Collecting nearby troops, we should be able to make up five or six hundred people."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to remind you that this is probably impossible. When we had 2,000 people, we did not withstand their artillery." Limda finally couldn’t help but solemnly reminded Dao, "What you should do is to leave immediately from the East Gate, then rush to the North Gate from the Outer City and join the 10th Division. If so, we may have a chance to win..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gowar shook his head: "It’s definitely too late. From here, go around the city and then rush to the North Gate. It takes 5 hours to walk and 3 hours to ride. In five hours, the city has already been settled - by that time, what I have to face is the intact wall of Lenny. What's more, your speculation is based on the surviving power of the 10th division. What if the 10th Division has been controlled or eliminated by some other means?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
