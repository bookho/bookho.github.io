But they have been entangled in the city for too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gloria Marquis Cavendish? von Figota, the third son of the old duke, pushed up the glasses and observed carefully Deployment of both parties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artillery and private maid artillery of the Principality were deployed on two positions not far from the north of the city, and the anti-assault of the Free Army cavalry had been defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was originally a very subtle and threatening anti-assault, they easily broke through the two infantry battalions of the artillery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether measured by any standard, the courage, willpower and fighting consciousness of those who are under the Meiya Rangers are better than the Gloria light of the Figotas. Cavalry, the number is far more than the number of medical knights, the entire empire may only be comparable to the Sotalan cavalry and the Royal Guardian heavy cavalry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately their enemy is Cavendish, perhaps the best tactician in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early hours of the morning, his organization’s crossing action defeated the first line of defense of the Freedom Army’s left wing and opened the way for the Elven Army. The free-spirited dispatch of the Freedom Army gave him more opportunities. At the expense of the five famous paintings collected by the Fegota family, he handed the right-wing battle to the mighty infantry of the Elf Army, and borrowed a few horses from the Elven Army. Formed a combination of cavalry and horse-infantry assault troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once again found the weakness of Bruto Luther. Not as he expected, Luther’s central forces were almost in turmoil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, his cavalry broke through the unusually fragile middle of the Freedom Army, leaving several cavalry brigades where Bruto Luther stayed辗Run around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not waste time chasing the squad, but turned directly to Blenheim, who happened to catch up with the suppression of the other half of the Freedom Army’s last dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, seven light cavalry battalions from the Gloria region are looking for pistols that can be used from the bodies of their companions and enemies. Every underworld armored soldier will carry at least six pistols, which is a good extra for the poor Gloria. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left-wing remnants of the medical knight left by the dead Atlas von Fegota are expelling the free army outside the city. Behind them are three horse-riding infantry battalions that have been laid off, and it is these forces that have completed the great interlude of the art of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he did not find the infantry of his brother Blucher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cavendi wrinkled his brow: "He should have five to six thousand infantry, and most of the infantry of the First and Second Army. They are all under him. I told him not to put all the infantry so quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cavendi Xuzema rushed to the position of the maid artillery, his brother All the staff are usually here. He quickly found the chief of the Second Army, in accordance with the name of Blücher, the "first near maid". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Caterea, where is the Marquis?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief maid looks up from the military map Come, open your mouth, but did not say anything. Cavendish frowned: the expression of this "frightened deer" is not her usual week. Every maid of Blücher has been through the battlefield. Their abilities and will are not lost to the best men, and they have established an artillery with the highest average mathematics in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing this sentence, Cavendish was shocked and angry: "Is he crazy? He forgot how the big brother died?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The owner is not crazy." Katelia finally opened her mouth. "What can I do? It is a demon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to translate "Villera added," Bruto Luther was in the town of Blenheim, and he personally fought in the first row. If the Marquis did not go up in person, the infantry must have collapsed. We never I have seen high-ranking pastors who are so desperate... No one. Although there are only nine battalions in the enemy, their morale is terrible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cavan Dixu stunned: "God... Luther, is he crazy? He doesn't know if he died here, will the entire South Army's North Wing be defeated?! Why waste magic in the first battle? Ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it does maximize the morale, it is too dangerous. What's more, using magic to kill each other's miscellaneous soldiers is one of the most inefficient uses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, now there should be more than nine thousand soldiers in the town of Blenheim. The infantry will be crowded and there are horses." Cavendish vaguely felt that it was unlucky. "No, it seems that I have to invest in infantry. Do you want someone to go together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maids hesitated They look at each other, but no one is taking care of them. Finally, Villeila raised her hand: "I have not been to the town yet... I will go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence scares Cavendish One jump: "You have all...have commanded the troops on the front line?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time everyone nodded together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really unexpectedly intense. But I can also understand the motives of your brother..." Cavendish shook his head, "killing Luther This battle can be ended. Moreover, if the commander of the other party is on the front line, we will not be able to level the morale gap if we do not press it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He In the direction of Blenheim, he finally took a look, and then replaced Bruchsell and ordered: "You still stop the shelling and continue to urge the shells to the rear. I have more cavalry, I will return to the south side of the enemy." "The Pluto guy should still not know that his central and reserve teams are already smashed. I will put some pressure on him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know why, card Wendy Xu vaguely felt that the current enemy is somewhat different from the previous one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is an enemy, even Cavendish has to admit that Bruto Luther is a good opponent. Although his fighting style is slightly dark, it is also full of rigorous calculations and embarrassing fraud. The battle that Atlas sacrificed was the most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cavendix believes that Luther will sneak into the front line to organize sneak attacks and snipers, and believe that he will destroy the deserters to create fear, but with the flag fighting in the musket The first row of soldiers... He does not believe this is the style of this opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably because he has been forced to a desperate situation, Cavendish thought, returned to his army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Blücher was commanding an attack in a private house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This house was originally a store, but it has been smashed by the Emperor’s artillery, and the melted cannon ice rim is saturated with the other half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In theory, he is now the Duke of von Figeta, but Blücher does not know about it. He knows that in theory he should have won, and his infantry in the town is almost twice as close as his opponent--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Organization offense." Marquis The expressionless continued to order, "The fourth battalion retreats, the seventh battalion is on top."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, the troops have been unable to hold up! My troops are really There is no way to attack again..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander of the seventh battalion stuttered, but Blucher had no longer wanted to listen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a madman!" The Marquis threw the stabbing sword in his hand. "Don't think that only Bruto Luther will kill himself!" I will!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really don't want my maids to see this. But as a nobleman, there are always things that have to be done... just like the bastard on the opposite side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Bluscher lamented in his heart, went forward, pulled out the sword, wiped the blood off with a handkerchief, and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The eighth battalion was mobilized and attacked with the seventh battalion. I personally directed the attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he does not want to see the enemy position. I don't want to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the enemy leader will personally stand in the first row of firemen, he must stand where he can see the troops before it is possible to launch an attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please, hurry to die, mad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brucher in the heart Meditate, go out the door. His troops began to gather, and the narrow streets of the town were crowded with soldiers of the Figota. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he picked up the telescope and used it to target the Western Army’s flag and the position below it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of position is that? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blenheim is a small town that is not really suitable as a battlefield for a decisive battle. The 9th Battalion Free Army, which is trapped here, has sufficient ammunition, but they do not have enough magical auxiliary troops. There are not many artillery units, and there is no shortage of supplies. There is no way to build construction work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Normally, it has long been a surrender..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they are already Lonely army. Through the telescope, he has seen that the flag of Figota is flying on the south side of the town. It is the reconnaissance cavalry of the Third Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruto? Luther is already crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther completely ignored Bruchelle’s intention to surrender his decent, and executed thousands of deserters and captives, and destroyed two or three streets. The body and the wreckage have built a line of defense! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time you see the opposite line of defense, the elegant artist commander wants to vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six to eight bodies are bundled with a shroud, a half-length chest wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourteen to sixteen bodies were added with a double bed board, a full-height earthen wall, and each free artillery was piled up with similar fortifications. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the slabs on the road were smashed and piled up on the ground, forming obstacles one after another, blocking the trajectory of the musket and the soldiers. charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just in this messy middle, the flag of the Western Army and the flag of Luther, and the flag of the three divisions are intertwined. , formed the backbone of the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The madman, Bruto Luther, who is recalcitrant, is under the banner. In order to suppress the dissatisfaction of the soldiers, all the positions near his main force were piled up with corpses. He and a few other Guards Masters were busy using the fortifications to reinforce the surrounding positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Let them recapture half of the town... obviously we have to win... obviously have to win..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brucher recalled the expression on Carterian's face after the last attack. He knew that these maids could not withstand the pressure of this kind of battle, and let them go back to the artillery position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also saw the battle, it was a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One company after another was shot and smashed and retired. Luther stood at the forefront of his position, under the rifle of firing a gun, adding a skewed shield to his troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is clearly a defensive side, the Free Army’s generals do not hide their love of offense. He personally led the bayonet battalion and rushed into the Ficolla army's firearms squadrons, regardless of casualties, and killed them before they pulled out the dagger. Every time Luther will attack, he will kill several deserters without a net, and then use their bodies to build new positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brucher knows that he will never do this. He can throw a stab and shoot the deserters, but he can never carry the body to use them to strengthen the fortifications. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But at least I can order the charge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of such work, the rifle is Useless, this has been proven in the last battle. Bruchelle did not want the maid to participate in such a bloody battlefield. Most of the magical division's mages and pastors were under the command of Cavendish, and he and his opponent were half-pounded in magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only by the number advantage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marquis put away the telescope, look around, see More than 900 soldiers in the seventh and eighth battalions are ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All, the bayonet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White Blade Charges, Recapture Our Lost Position! Kill Luther!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers Rare of. But of course no one dares not to charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis only ignored a bit. He did not notice that in the far south of the telescope, the clouds were changing rapidly, reacting to something that progressed at a speed of two kilometers per second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear the sound of your own troops When the enemy shouted, the girl knew that the enemy had started to attack again. She looked out from behind the fortifications of the bodies of both sides and looked for her own goals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not under her own, that is, Pluto? Luther’s flag, but on the real first line against the imperial white blade charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She jumped on a group of corpses, picked up the sacred sword in her hand, and smashed the heads of two Figota soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One thousand and one forty-four. One thousand and one fifteen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision has Almost reduced to a minimum. The sense of smell, taste and touch have long been sacrificed, and she still barely keeps hearing, but not much. These can be used to exchange magic, of course, the nerves of numbness. In the past twenty minutes, she has killed more people than the previous two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killing has become a conditional reflex. Those who use divine magic, if they wish, can become murderous madmen on the front line – just like the medical knights who are proud of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rushed into an enemy bayonet class. Listening to the screams of these people seems to be in the Shenoran area. She was too lazy to think about it. The swords in her hands were used to remove the group, and then they took a bayonet and killed a few people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy’s assassination hit her sacred shield and slipped away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One thousand and twenty-three."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie stopped and stepped back A few steps, jumped on a fortification, panting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a bit late. Why haven’t you come... It’s five minutes later than expected...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little unpredictable foreboding. From the last contact of Anne to the present, it should be enough for the initial preparation of the Magic. The five-minute gap caused her to wait until the enemy launched a fourth attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, Bonnie is still not sure to complete the nine sacred magic. She only has eight paragraphs and she has only eight paragraphs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she has a way to try it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before those primitive religions have not yet signed a peaceful covenant, they are mostly brutal religions that accept blood sacrifices. Bonnie read the principles of sacred magic, and also read the logic of arcane, knowing that there are still many blood sacrifice beliefs in modern magic...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the body is heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All magic effects are gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protect magic, heal magic, speed up magic, transform into magic. All the magic disappeared, although she could hardly see it, but she knew that there were blue lines, red lines, and purple lines flying in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the magic net. Although it was a little late, Anne still completed the magic of the magic net. She didn't know how it was done, but Bonnie could guess that her sister had to pay the most price - because the magic was finished later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she has no time to think, just take the time to move her right hand to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have offered enough sacrifices! Give me a miracle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie Looking up, I watched the clouds begin to grow bigger and gather, and even the afternoon sun seemed to light up. The clouds shrouded half of the sky within ten seconds, and only the sun insisted on spotlight on her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What I need is-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly a voice rushed into her eardrum . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naked...naked girl!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie bowed her head and saw that she was not Inch, the whole body is covered with blood and sporadic pieces of meat. She blushes and suddenly realizes what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the magic effects on her body disappeared while the magic net structure switched. The identity of "Pluto? Luther", and all his appearances, appearances, costumes, etc., which he made with magic, disappeared, leaving only the products of the magic - the blood of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie said a word reflexively, but then Know that you have made a bigger mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The miracle is not finished yet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment she spoke, the white cloud suddenly rolled up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting from the clouds just above her fingers, those clouds instantly glowed with blood red and rushed to the half that was originally occupied by the sun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A miracle is a sin if it goes wrong", this sentence immediately crossed the eyes of Bonnie Sefer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has never seen anyone use this magic, only seen in the legendary record. There is only one point that is certain: once a person with insufficient strength and beliefs prays for a miracle failure, the sacred will come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"--Don't want to die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She blurted out again, continued the sentence, Shyly retreating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the last trace of sunshine was still covered by a cloud of blood. Everyone heard thunder, and everyone around Bonnie stopped fighting and stared at the sky in panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s over. Such an idea flashed in Bonnie's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, sister. It’s over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shouted out the last order: "Freedom Army, all retreat! I ordered as Bruto Luther--"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers were all stunned and did not obey her command. All magic fails, the sky suddenly changes, the cruel and brave fighting master will suddenly become a girl - it is hard to say which one is more impact on the Free Army soldiers, perhaps the last one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"--Don't fuck me who I am! Hurry up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of this scene, Blücher has a very different reaction. He has been using telescopes to capture the position of dangerous enemy masters, capturing the fighters at all times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the voice of Bonnie was not heard, the Marquis standing in the reserve team had a completely different judgment on the scene in front of him. For two hundred years, no priest has ever used miracle magic. Atlas, the only one of the three brothers who has studied the sacred magic, has already died. In Brechsell’s view, this is obviously Luther’s madman—no, Luther’s female madman, no wonder she was so crazy – the last dying struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She wants to use magic to fight, killing... or licking her before she completes the magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brucher grabbed a musket and killed a soldier who turned to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No retreat! I am a woman!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the tornado was scraped Get up, then thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the red clouds are coming to Bonnie’s location. The Freedom Army soldiers escaped without a fate, while the soldiers of the Figo Tower Army reached out to grab the enemy's master...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then the red cloud was amazing The speed rushed to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the "those of heaven." It wants to collect the sacrifices of the losers, but does not care to take hundreds more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red cloud is on the ground and becomes a blood fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood fog and the thousands of dead and countless bodies were rolled up by a tornado, tearing everything into broken water droplets and throwing the body in the wind. It has produced a variety of disgusting parts that are difficult to describe and even hard to imagine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is back in the ground and there is a huge pothole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood droplets in the air have been broken into tiny particles that are broken down into smaller red particles by the action of lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They sprinkle evenly on the ground, forming a thick layer of red frost, shining in the summer sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blucher von?Fengota stared at the big hole in front of him, feeling overwhelmed, stepping back and sitting on the ground . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the red clouds are scattered, it is a clear sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...not dead?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it has been. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie? Sefir barely opened his eyes, only to see the darkness around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reached out and rubbed her face, but only touched a hand of blood and minced meat, as if there was a worm crawling up her fingers. The bodies that were first used to build fortifications have been sunburned for noon in the summer and have begun to rot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie nodded his face back and smashed the corpse. This is just an illusion. She said to herself, this is just an illusion. it's OK. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is...where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is very heavy. No, the body is pressed under a lot of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie immediately realized what it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the mountain where the bodies are piled up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holded by tornadoes, I don’t know how big, how tall, how thick the mountains are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All killed by her own, killed by her commanding troops, killed by her failed miracle magic, all human bodies, all her Sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her ambition, her arbitrariness, her deception, her nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I haven’t heard of an example of swearing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie responds immediately come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The last 'I don't want to die' request was fulfilled... Ah haha, ah haha, ah haha. I killed so many, so many people I even exchanged my own immortality..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she gave up trying to build the magic net at the last minute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her sister, Anne, struggled to build a magic net connection for her, wasted by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is just an eight-legged mage and pastor... never reaches the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nine sacred magic. Her heart hurts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even after surpassing the times, she still can’t be a real big magician or a bishop? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she also has nine magics... If Anne is not asking for her to establish a magic net at this time...if the Figota army is not that Strong, or Marshal Lopez did not deduct so many reserve teams in Jena...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She would not be forced to this point. Both hands are already covered with blood and can no longer be turned back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you tell your sister... haha, haha, haha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Laughing, but Bonnie knew that her laughter was harder than crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic net without agreement can work, but it needs to be reorganized by the senior mage or pastor as the core, just like Anne is in the mud and the land The thing that Ni is doing is the same. In the long run, this is tantamount to saying that the magic net will gradually dissipate naturally - but in the entire reorganization process, there will be a large number of areas without magic and wild magic, and will cause more sacrifices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in any case, Bonnie also wants to tell her sister about this news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you word it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie concentrates and starts calling Annie and her Telepathy between. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I failed. I didn't complete the agreement. I didn't win the battle. The Western Army is probably finished. I don't know if there is any chance to rebuild the magic net. It’s... I’m really useless.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, sister. Your sister has failed your expectations...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be silent, my sister, yell at me. I know this is indeed..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still no response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, can you say...no..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie finally understood What does silence mean. That is not Annie is angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is always a smiling sister, Anne Sefir has no ability to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie will no longer marry her, no matter what she does, she will not blame her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie finally understands why the sect did not kill her--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because let me Living, is it an option that is more cruel than letting me die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, why is this happening? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, why not let me die? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the sister who died? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie cried out, tears mixed in the flesh and blood around, turned into blood and tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But maybe it was blood and tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't... I don't want to live like this. This is not the era I want, my sister."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of Bonnie’s right hand began to gather subconsciously, turning into a burst of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But if this is the case... I will have to go back to help you resurrect, isn't it? I can't stay here. You probably left a memory backup? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood, the minced meat and the corpse fell naturally under the force of gravity, pouring her face. Bonnie’s natural beauty was covered up by these things, and at first glance it was like a bloody zombie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he and the zombie are probably about the same, she thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb your sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She whispered Apologize to countless dead people around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie found that his ability to use magic has completely disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter which god, no one can hear her voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the case... Is this revenge for me to be fascinated by power?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Bonnie put another magic. More bodies flew up to the sky, and the sun shone through her new big hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't admit it! I don't admit this reality! What about it! Politics is a big quagmire of filth, but human beings are just advancing in filth. If you want me to admit this reality, let me die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the re-exposing afternoon sun, the corpse mountain emits a strong rot Stinky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we can't jump into the mud because the mud is dirty! Under the cover of bloody shirts, it is a more civilized future! I don't admit defeat! I will never admit defeat, this is the magic net that my sister gave up life to build!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie screamed and screamed, got up and used one Sending more blasting magic, blowing up the corpse of your own body and flying around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't use magic, is this revenge? But I won't admit it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She stood up and looked around. She found herself standing in the setting sun, stained with blood, and some of the emperors who were preparing for the firewood were staring at her suddenly standing up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I won't admit it!" Bonnie wiped her tears away. "If the facts don't match our ideals, then change the facts!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Figota soldiers seem to recognize her, they screamed and fled, to apply for rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if I, Bonnie Sefer died here! Then I can at least leave a magic net for the world, isn't it?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** Bonnie Sefer once again raised his right hand against the cloudless sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a reckless thing that no one has ever done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every priest who tried to apply for a miracle and failed to become a squad almost died on the spot. If they did not die on the spot, they also spent most of their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods are on! I, Bonnie Seifer, No matter whether you are willing to respond to my request, but I know that you can definitely hear it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to tell you - no matter how many times, I have to try! I will not allow my sister to pay for life to build the magic net can not work! Even if the dam named 'common sense' or 'static reality' smashed I have to apply for a miracle for the second time! If it still doesn't work, I will be the third time, the fourth time, until my scarred body is destroyed, or you are destroyed! I don't care if you are a covenant or a god. , or monotheistic cults, even deism... I don't care who you are! I want miracles, now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She breathes deeply With a sigh of relief, he shouted: "Start the physical layer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing happens. There is no cloud gathering, no tornado, no gathering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie Sefer is no longer a double-caster, but she is still making a statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that I can. Rationality produces magic, and the highest state of magic is called 'willingness'. The meaning of wishing is "thinking" Bring what you want. But, in the final analysis, the wishing technique is still in the realm of reason, but only realizes the possible wishes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie The right hand clenched into a fist and slammed into the sky again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Start the data layer! I know what you can hear! It is prayer that comes from faith. Everyone knows what the highest state of prayer is, but never I have seen it. The magic is called 'miracle'. It was not the area I could touch..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked around and found the highest on the mountain A little, gone over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Starting the network layer! The miracle I want is not asking for nothing! It is not a matter of thought, not illusion, not delusion, miracle is not a realization The magic designed by your own wishes... It is the magic that is realized to achieve everyone's wishes! It is the magic designed to realize the reality that it should be!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No response. But Bonnie was not discouraged. She stood at the top of the corpse mountain and tried to think back to the agreement she needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Starting the transport layer! Miracle is beyond the existence of reason, miracle is the ultimate meaning of human pursuit, miracle is the reversal of everything that can change. Miracle is ideal, yes Pursuit is the last light when everything is in despair!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Bonnie’s mind, the magic net has taken shape. The self-evident agreement is beginning to be built. She does not need to experiment, and she can feel the protocols and models that are gradually forming in her own brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Starting the session layer! After I saw the real despair, I finally knew where I was! - I lack the courage to ask that wayward request! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Bonnie Sefer, is the undead who climbed out from the sea of ​​desperate corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Start the presentation layer! The miracle will only appear in the most desperate moments, its only role is to make the impossible possible! It is like using in ancient drama The coming of the gods is the ultimate cadenza to change the destiny when the plot is deadlocked!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Bonnie Seifer, I already know why I can't use miracles before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Starting the application layer - the gods, let me be willful once! I have not granted the ultimate grace of the gods to me for so many years. It’s too much, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the last question raised, the surroundings are still quiet –<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But Anne has been keenly aware of the change. There are subtle changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone should be his own pastor! I don't need church because I am my own church! I am my miracle itself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She feels this change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bloody wind, the dam called "Common Sense" is being lowered, and the miracle flood can be over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the name of Bruto Luther. In the name of Meliyana Querica, in the name of Bonnie Sefer ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the name of my sister Anne Sefer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine-story holy magic! This is the nine sacred magic...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, this is the power beyond the paragraph! This is a miracle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can control this miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, I ask, no, I command you-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let this A beautiful and cruel world, shaking with my will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the miracle come for me! It will rewrite the tragedy as a comedy and rewrite the sadness as a victory!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's the fulfillment and sacrifice of Anne Sefer's. She added a sentence to her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Building the Magic Network Protocol!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s exactly the same as before, without any response . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining Imperial soldiers are about to start laughing -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunset is projected, Projected on the face of Bonnie Sefer, shining in her pupil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when the eyes of brown-haired girls have turned red and blue--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then, they began to change color and became purple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purple pupil collided with the yellow glow of the setting sun, and in Bonnie’s field of vision formed a small white spot that she could only see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ethernet Tuning! Compile Protocol Setup! Analyze Node Setup! Root Node Operation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonnie put down her right hand and gently covered the little white spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let the end of the old era, let the new era open! Let all ideas coexist equally, let all knowledge flow freely!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie thought, this is the last sustenance that my sister asked me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I finished it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, from this moment - the magic net starts!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic whirlpool like lightning As the magic net speeds. It is a dazzling white light, brighter than the sun, even people who can't magic can see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every white light is in the narrative, the era of the magic net has arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From now on, not only can everyone use their magic to become a magician; everyone can also find their faith and become a pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From now on, everyone can be their own pastor. Everyone should be their own church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the miracle came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time of August 9th at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, in the history of the Great Magic Net is marked as "zero." That is the Internet that came to the early days of modern history, and it is above the level of technology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it will also act on matter in turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all this, Bonnie Safir looked up from the miracle and found that she was surrounded by water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North is Bluchler? von Figota and his army, to the south is Cavendish von Figota and his army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all the emperors held a torch in their hands, and around the body of the body, the firewood had already piled up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
