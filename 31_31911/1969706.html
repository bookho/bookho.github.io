The lost one will be closed for ten days here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "We are here to sort by first come, newcomer. I closed for nine days, and the remaining two were closed for six days and two days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry about food The problem, these gels can be eaten. The amount is enough, it won't rot, and there is a bit of apple taste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the conversation is messy, it can still understand the general idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion of reasoning is also obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the cell used to hold the thieves who intend to invade the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trap set by this estate is not a burglar, guard or killing trap in the usual sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the institution that automatically conducts trials and detentions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cell itself occasionally puts music on. The style of music is very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not like the sound of a positive instrument with a resonance chamber, it’s not melodious, it’s a bit noisy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The owner of the design and construction of this mansion must be a very bad person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I can’t help but comment in my heart. A building that is made up of strange pride and taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if it’s the builder, wouldn’t you think that such a heavily guarded house would be used as a test site by the local thieves’ guild? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the face is involuntarily smiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, I haven’t seen you before. Is it new?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think I want to decide to use the other party's misunderstanding first. Maybe it's very useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I came from a foreign country, I wanted to try my luck. You are...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The Port of Hong Kong Thieves Guild. Have you not reported to us yet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a less honest chill, at least confirmed his position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the magic net, you can easily find knowledge about the phase port. It is the port with the largest throughput in the Republic of the Republic, the center of Western maritime trade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other person looked at his own dress, with a slight scorn in his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White dress, hey, you have to have a few hundred gold coins. No wonder you want to dress like a big lady who is going to dinner, want to mix in? Unfortunately, unlucky, this is a Empty house, the thief set does not work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a lie. Who knows who the owner of this house is, and it is not wrong to say that this dress is stolen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several female thieves changed their minds and slammed around to start the touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "True, really silk. There are hundreds of gold pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s definitely not something that you bought like this. You are probably the first one to enter the clothing room in this castle.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Who are you? Having the ability to break through so many traps, should it be famous?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncomfortably twisted a few times and pulled back the sleeves. A female thief with long black hair bit her lip and unwillingly let go of her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence. I can't remember it, and I can't remember one thing about the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not a name, it’s a guild code. The name is definitely not convenient. I’m a 'green ring', this is a 'silver plate', she is It is '貂皮'. What is your code name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The source of the several code names is to understand, it is obviously stolen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more expensive the booty, the more powerful the code sounds... probably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The code name certainly cannot be remembered. Besides, my own situation is not like a thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another female thief with short maroon hair breaks out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With this skill, it may not be convenient to even say the code. Anyway, we do not force members to register their true identity and pay their income. "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since everyone is here, will you pay the dues?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people in front of me seem to not allow her to say "no". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it. In the phase port, you can use the temporary code... 'White silk' how? With your ability, 'phase port The name of the white silk will soon be as loud as your original name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the name of the stolen goods. But there seems to be no room for choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down at the costumes, he smiled helplessly. I can't always propose a "princess" for myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'White silk'? Sounds good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***** ****<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thursday, October 19, 1668<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuangdaozhi国英特雷南相港 (portphase)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Before the industrial revolution, shipping was the only way to transport both day and night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, shipping is more powerful than day and night: a sea boat can't even stop before it can be anchored. As long as there are no shipwrecks and pirates, the cost-effectiveness of shipping is the highest. The shipping of Lu Xinhai and the Intres Sea has already existed before the history of written records. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for those who first took the sea boat - such as Major Neremon Soledon and most of his gendarmerie, " The great advantage of day and night is simply the most terrible nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea stun is several times more horrible than the inland river ferry, and it is quite different from the previous experience in the port to the navy. The ups and downs of the waves are day and night, and the decks under their feet have been constantly shaking, and occasionally they are strong enough to pick up the entire hull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is because the Intercontinental Sea that cut off the two islands and the French Isles is still under the threat of the Elf-Imperial Union Fleet. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After defeating the Fifth Fleet, the Joint Fleet captured three sturdy military ports in the narrow sea, serving as the bases for the Imperial Fleet and the Elves. Today, these three military ports are protected by a ceasefire agreement, threatening the narrow sea route. They encountered the Freedom Army sub-fleet and hanged the flag of the war. When they encountered the merchant ship that had placed the order, they hanged the smuggling flag and rushed on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a counterattack, one-third of the battleships of the Seventh Fleet were also dispersed into the narrow sea, using themselves as bait, and cruelly strangling with those privately-owned ships. war. Wei Taiping is not afraid that the elves and the imperial people will join hands; even the remaining two-thirds will be enough to fight against the joint fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining fleet is along with the remnants of the original Fifth Fleet -< =""="">-. Of course, those remnants are no longer using the name "Fifth Fleet". Their current number is "Seventh Fleet Narrow Sea Fleet", by Lieutenant General Leonard Kikawi and Daro Sarah. Major General Mi Navy led. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They plan to bypass the entire West Intre Island in half a month and reach the phase port at the junction of the Shuangdao via the Great South Sea Channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan is always better than reality. It has been three weeks, and the fleet has not yet reached its destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great waves of the Great South Sea can sweep over the entire deck and occasionally hear distant whale songs. The faint connection of the magic net even went deep into the sea, and it was linked to the mysterious civilizations that sank under the ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On those days when I was on the boat, more than half of them ate and vomited after eating a little bit, spitting a bit of a tragic life. The horses in the group are even worse, and they have died more than half of the disease. The horse meat has become a meal for the sailors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the priest in the gendarmerie regiment is twice as large as the standard, he can barely use the divine magic to relieve the seasickness sickness of some seasickness and sickness. A first-time priest can handle more than a dozen people in a full day, compared to more than 2,000 officers and men of the independent gendarmerie. If the door is not arranged in advance, the extra magician will be on board, fearing that one or two soldiers will be lost in these weeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are so many magic users to find, the young majors feel that their luck is really good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the defeat of the Fifth Fleet, the number of seagoing ships to Interre has plummeted, and countless merchants, refugees and passengers have been stranded in Fort Vatican. As soon as I heard that the Seventh Fleet was going back to Interry, the people who planned to take the boat had a long queue. The door-to-door gendarmerie regiment bears the responsibility of managing these civilians on the ship and prevents them from making trouble at sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some strangers who want to go to Interre, and it’s no wonder that the Seventh Fleet has happily lost this hot potato. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citizens of the Freedom countries have more than 20,000 citizens, covering all walks of life, from the merchants, bankers to the circus, thieves, and everything; The sum of the subjects and the elves is actually more than a thousand, which is not much less than the gendarmes under the door. Even if each ship can carry a hundred extra passengers, the entire transportation plan will use more than two hundred battleships and armed merchant ships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not sure how many spies and spies intend to take this opportunity to mix into Interre, but he knows a lot. He sternly refused any requests from civilians and foreigners to take the flagship and main battleships, even if some people repeatedly requested him through various channels. If there is another incident of hijacking in Fort Worth, Namimen can't rely on these seasickness to solve the crisis without the people around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen and his staff divided the forces at hand into two parts: the garrison and the reserve team. A group of ten people in the security unit is responsible for maintaining law and order on the ships. The people who can use magic in the passengers are also under their surveillance. The reserve team is concentrated in the fifth fleet, which is a few large ships with a small fleet of narrow seas. After all, Nanimen and its deputy commander are very familiar, putting the command here is more reassuring than the battleship placed on Wei Taiping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fleet will pick a smoother time to pick up the sails for the entire team and confirm the position of each ship relative to the main fleet. A large fleet of sailboats like the Seventh Fleet will last for more than a dozen nautical miles, and each fleet must use a telescope to see each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goalkeeper will seize this period of time to check the downsizing of each team, and transfer the sick person back to the relatively large main ship to ease the condition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Central Bank of the Confucian Citizens, the Land Banking Plan of the Empire, the Currency Exchange Bank of Lenny, the Goldsmith and the Insurer of Interre..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From The bank definition that Anne got there seems to be subtly different from the existing banks above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door does not know what these differences are, but if a system can survive for more than two hundred years, then it must have its unique advantages. On the paper, he wrote the names of the largest goldsmiths and insurers in Phase Harbor and decided to visit them after landing. Nami is not sure how the bank should work – but if there are so many large banks that are ready to go, it should be possible to negotiate a more appropriate approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Langde & Sons, Memphis and Link, the pure gold trade, the federal exchange... almost."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was satisfied with a nod, and the plan that had been condensed for three weeks was put into the arms. Although it may not be successful, he still feels quite certain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s strange to say that the more you concentrate on meditation and practicing magic, the heavier the sense of seasickness. When you start writing the draft plan, you forget the boat board under your feet. Just like sometimes lying in bed will turn over and go to sleep, the more work you start working, the more spiritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it seems to be slowing down... Is it the whole team in the middle of the night? It’s weird."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Hearing the sound of "staying in the sail! Anchoring!" outside the cabin, the door stood up and stretched out an incomplete lazy waist in the narrow cabin, and drilled a narrow hatch with his shoulders. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his memory, this is the first time in three weeks that the entire team has been in the fleet. Since they can't see the slogan at night, they can only use the lamp language and the gun to communicate with each other. The Navy officers will generally avoid complicated formations at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bit of doubt, Nana came out of his single cabin and bowed down to the deck, looking for someone who knows how to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major is riding the flagship of the squadron of the narrow sea submarine, "The Honourable Lucius", the only remaining four three-deck main ship of the Fifth Fleet. First, it is also the seat of the deputy commander of the fleet, Major General Daro Salami. His single cabin is in the middle of the upper deck. Although it is the best room on board except for the captain's cabin, it has to go through several twists and turns to reach the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climb a few steps and walk out of the hatch, he habitually attached a safety rope to the belt. There is never a lack of safety ropes on an oceangoing sailboat, and almost every sailor is saved by these simple ropes. Most of his own men are also gathered on the deck, and these people wearing army uniforms are in stark contrast to the sailors around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsurprisingly, Nanamen saw the slightly blessed body of Major General Daro standing at the bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went forward and said hello: "Hello, Rear Admiral, this is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The words of the door suddenly fell into the scorpion. Looking at the commander of the sub-fleet and the eyes of almost everyone on the deck, the reason for stopping the ship in the middle of the night is really obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is always there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea at night should have been dark. Naimen had ran to the deck several times at night, screaming at the ship's side and vomiting. He was very familiar with the boundless endless darkness. There is no artificial light, only the oil lamps and torches used for lighting on the ship will make people feel the darkness of the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now at the end of the field of vision is a bright band that divides the strait, and dozens of light beams that point to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green light band that pierces the night shines in the waves, not only separating the sea from the sky, but also separating the Intres Sea and the Great South Sea. It also separates the Intres and the West Island from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it’s the starry sky above the head, or the torches that are all lit on the Seventh and Fifth Fleet, it’s worth mentioning more than the light at the end of the sea. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to visit the phase port, the Soledon Warlord makes you. There is a phase bridge and twenty-seven lighthouses, the largest port in the civilized world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naimen knew that this was originally the home port of the Fifth Fleet, and it would be as familiar to Major General Daro as his own. He smiled slightly and followed the words of the Rear Admiral to raise a question that the other party must know the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you need twenty-seven lighthouses? I heard that even in the seas of Emerald Bay, there is only one main channel lighthouse."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello is the shining lighthouse that the Elf Empire built in Emerald Bay? The pointed ears always boast that it is the greatest sea building. We admit, They are quite big, but they are quite big compared to our phase port. Oh, it’s not enough.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem scratched the itch of Darrow. Since the mutiny of Fort Tilburg, the navy's navy has been like a personal change, pointing to the lighthouses, his hands in the air against the outline of the map, and flying as if returning to the days when the Fifth Fleet dominated the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only one narrow Watergate Strait between the Isle of Wight, the westernmost point of the West Island and the westernmost point of the East Island across the sea. But this The two peninsulas are not as simple as the ones on the map. There are many corners on both sides of the peninsula that extend like two relatively unfolded hands. The Shuimen Strait was originally a very dangerous waterway. It is very difficult to sail at night, from the direction of the Great South Sea. It is impossible for a ship to enter Hong Kong at night. About 70 or 80 years ago, in order to change this point, the recently established Intercontinental Council and the Phase Port Local Council decided to establish a lighthouse on all the prominent corners of the north and south sides of the phase port. In the beginning of the identification of the route. There were only seven lighthouses at the beginning, but after decades of trade, there were more and more merchants in the city, and the construction of the lighthouse became a symbol of the status of the merchant. The latest one is the war. It was just completed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his endless stream, the signal fireworks rose from the flagship "Pingbo" of the Seventh Fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darrow looked at the fireworks with a little surprise: "Into the salute and banquet? At this time and place, is the Marshal being serious?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is also staring at the bullets and nodded: "I think you should have no-< =""="">-the direction of the signal, the party location should not be The flagship is the supply ship 'Xiyang'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that many people will not sleep well tonight. This demonstration is really simple and rude... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darrow was not willing to stop and shouted to the sailors on the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Singing salutes to the harbor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunboats in the fleet are busy, loading The hand was wasting the gunpowder on the boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The habit of salute is almost as long as the history of a ship-borne artillery. It is used to explain to a port or a foreign fleet that its vessel is not hostile. The artillery needs to be cooled, and it takes time to load. When all the guns of a ship are ringing, it is impossible to put the battle back into the short term. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the entire Seventh Fleet began firing, the sound of the cannon seemed to be endless. The time of firing the guns varies from unit to fleet. The largest four-deck gunships have more than one hundred guns. Thousands of cannons sounded in turn, and the lights of the distant lighthouse shook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are telling the same thing: the Seventh Fleet of the Free Navy came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the Fifth Fleet was defeated, the ceasefire agreement was signed, but this blue water is still the territory of the Red Fleet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rumble of salute, the Sentinel Fleet of the Seventh Fleet, under the leadership of the diversion vessel, began to anchor through the strait and into the Intres Sea . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door has seen the map, crossing the end of the long bridge, is the Intres Sea. The world's largest port is just north of the bridge, the inner side of the narrow sea. He picked up the telescope and looked in the direction of the green light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This look, he was surprised to almost close his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship of one ship after another rushed through the bridge without a stop, their sails intersected the bridge deck of the bridge, but there was no obstacle The grounds cross each other and none of them are damaged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What magic? Is there any change?" When he heard the door, Darrow hurriedly picked up his telescope. "Oh, it looks all right..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Resistance door stared at him in surprise. Is it only he who sees those sails passing through the bridge? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the expression of the young major, Darrow suddenly realized. The Rear Admiral smiled and tried to ask: "Does the Warlord let you know the origin of the name 'Phase Port'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you say... "The door is also reacting violently. "The glowing bridge itself is a magical product?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daro lowered the voice: "That is the phase bridge, this The bridge, which is several nautical miles long, communicates with the two most important cities on the island of Interlake. Almost every officer knows this thing. After all, it is the port with the largest throughput in the entire civilized world. Ah."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen felt a burst of fever on his face: "I have talked with so many Intresas in these few weeks, no one has mentioned "This thing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably they think this thing is well known, the most famous of the phase port is this phase bridge."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere suddenly collapsed. The Rear Admiral is embarrassed to continue, and the door does not want to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a coincidence that a resident mage ran over and asked the Major General Daro to ask for the time -< =""="">- . The Major General apologized to the doorway and hurriedly left to command the fleet to port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one person in the vicinity of the bow. He took out the plan he had just written from his arms, sighed and made a tear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The most famous phase bridge in Lianzhou Port is not clear about what happened. Are you planning to establish a career here, Nami Soleton? Is it a rough financial plan, and the army that has not been taken by two thousand ships?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the beginning of Wei Taiping’s opinion is correct. . This is not a problem that can be solved by the guillotine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don’t know why, I can’t go anywhere, and the sheets of paper are tightened and loosened. The fingers trembled, and it was impossible to shred the plan that had been condensed for three weeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Phase Bridge is located in Phase Port and is one of the highest crystallizations of modern magic engineering."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Anne's voice suddenly sounded in the ear of the door. Still cold, no feelings, like a sound of magic synthesis. Anne's memory has the knowledge of the future and the ability to quickly query the Internet.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The phase port is the port that communicates between East and West, and is also the most important in the era of great navigation. In the trading port, almost all modern financial systems originated in this port."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is always not allowed to start Anne's memory. When he wants it, it can be activated every time, but occasionally it will be like this, the voice will speak on its own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since ancient times, East Island and West Island have been under the control of different forces, and the twin cities of Phase Port are the same. Elf and human, Eastern Governor And the Western Governor, the Holy Empire and the Yellow Turban, until more than a hundred years ago, the Comans used the power of the Navy to truly unify the two cities into one city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time, Namimen felt that he seemed to have discovered some rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are planning to tell me that there are problems with the plan that can be fixed. If there is any problem with the information, can you re-collect it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Anne’s voice ignored him, but continued to relay the information from the memory of the Magic Net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fortress on the east side was named the gorge, which literally means "the city built on the strait", which is the closest to the West established by the yellow scarves. The city on the west side was named Saranpoli, the city founded by the Elven Empire. It was renamed Nangang during the Empire. When the People’s people established the Republic, the two cities were adjusted to the same Under the administrative division."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
