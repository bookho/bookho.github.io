			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time flies. The situation in the South has entered a temporary calm, covering up the crisis that will come at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 1st, Kengler issued a total of two million pounds of banknotes through the Crosso Brothers Bank, and began to integrate all banking operations in the city of Ruhrock Get loans through the financial crisis. On January 9, including the secret negotiations of the three parties. On January 11, the Central Army was forced to withdraw 35 kilometers from Kengal after paying a little price. On January 23, Lenny, Kengler, and DeLan signed a secret agreement to determine whether to rely on the election to determine the autonomy or return of the Union, and the government to recognize the Constitution and the electoral law of the Republic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 11th, the Imperial Advisory Group and the Volunteers arrived in the north of Kengal, and the Fifth National Division arrived in the south of Kengal. On February 21, the first election of the Governor's government officially decided to start in a month. The autonomous party representing DeLand’s interests, the Federal Party representing Lenny’s interests, and the contemptuous Liberal Party have all been involved in the struggle for the entire Jurrlock. On February 23, the first "Republic of the Republic" stationed in Steelburg officially announced its support for the Kengal election. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the winter is in a moment of peace, and the freezing line gradually retreats to the north. When the spring equinox of the standard year of 1666 finally arrived, there were only a handful of places where snow could be seen in the countries of the Freedom - one of Kengal is one of them. The spring here is the coldest among the free nations. The cold current from the hinterland of the northeastern mainland was blocked by the Central Mountain Range, affecting the river from the north of the River Os River to the King River. The plain in the middle reaches of the Wangren River is called the “final position of the continental climate” in the geography textbook. The average temperature is much lower than the imperial capital of the imperial capital of Deland, 500 kilometers away from the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, few people in this era know about meteorology. The casters struggled to pray and study, and they could barely control the mild changes in the climate within a small area—the giant magic of “environmental transformation”, although already in theory, has not yet been put into practice. Those mages who advocate that manpower can change the weather are ridiculed by the church: How can the weather, even the gods, not be controlled, change by manpower? As for ordinary people, the understanding of the climate is only the thickness of the clothes and the intuitive natural phenomenon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It will snow in March, it’s really the North. If it’s in Lennie, it’s time to start preparing for summer business."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young lieutenant opened the thick curtains of the single officer’s dormitory and found a thin layer of white debris on the outside window sill. The cold wind that was previously suppressed by the curtains sneaked through the small gap and sneaked him, causing him to shudder and had to look back and grab the coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military uniform of the Central Army is a thick and rough blue-gray military coat, the color continues the blue of the old Northern Army. These coats are old goods that are turned out from the warehouse. They are sad clothes that don’t look handsome or lean no matter how they are worn. In the case of the third-rate militia unit in which he is located, it is already good to ensure that everyone has a coat. Quality is purely a luxury. The only advantage is that everyone wears a broken coat and potential enemy snipers. It is difficult to distinguish the officers by clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhong Li walked out of the simple temporary dormitory. The cold wind blew on his left eye, which caused a bit of pain. He hurried back into the corridor, carefully took out a small box, and took a piece of glass contact lens from the inside and put it on his left eye. It felt a lot better. The last time he was injured, he did not find a priest who could treat him all. He had to maintain his vision with the magic items that his adjutant gave him, waiting for natural recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rows of barracks that housed 7,500 people were built by a caster and soldiers in one night, and filled in with cement. After six gaps, you can barely resist the cold wind. Surrounded by small fences surrounded by wooden slabs and brick walls, it is better than the “temporary camp” stipulated in the regulations; in other words, if you cast a gun or a standard caster, you can simply break through. . The main entrance of the camp is two simple wooden pillars with a slanted wooden sign hanging in it, with the uppercase black letters in the fifth national division of the Free Central Army, "War" (ff'halberd'). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sad national number is worthy of this sad army that has been shrinking for a month in the city of Kangle. The troops were not well equipped, the training was not perfect, and the military officers were not good. Even the camps were so small that they were suppressed to a considerable extent: even the cafeteria borrowed the houses outside the camp, and then found a few volunteer chefs to manage... ...this is just because there are not enough qualified soldiers in the compilation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saddest thing is that this thing is still his own work. When his adjutant found the chefs, he also specially brought him one interview. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, bear the door! When will you compensate for the damage you caused?" "How is the recent special mission, Lieutenant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the cafeteria, A colleague of the same level and his name called his name in a sigh of relief and greeted him. Two school officials who were picking up food turned around and smiled as if they were wearing a mask. The young lieutenant knew that he was not highly rated in the military corps. He coped with these colleagues, and chose to sit down on the empty table with everyone, and casually get on the buffet table with only a variety of bread, ham and butter. I ate some. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, with his record in the military, it is a strange thing to have a good evaluation. His age is too light, he has not been a military school as a caster, and he has many bad records of special work in the rebels, huge losses to the military, and even false reporting. For a lieutenant officer who is only 19 years old, this record is enough to make every boss have a headache. He is also one of the few official officers of the national division who has officially appointed officers, which makes the informal officers who only have the "volunteer" ranks respect him. He is only himself, no group is willing to accept him...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear The scream of the sergeant’s guardian sergeant, he hurriedly stood up with everyone else. Like all the temporarily mobilized National Army divisions, the warrior's commander Benson; Dick was once a prominent politician. County councillors, local councillors, then the mayor, the third state secretary, the republican parliamentarian, and the minister until they were appointed as divisions of warriors because of their outstanding performance in the conscription and coup crisis. As long as he has an outstanding record, he can then ride anywhere in the military or political circles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sit down. The days of the Kengal election have finally arrived. Recently everyone has worked hard. It is estimated that things will be fixed, and we can change back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Benson returned to the table after returning to the ceremony. Of course, the temporary general will always have a caring smile to his subordinates, trying to make a generous and gentle boss image. However, as a politician with a keen sense of smell, he is afraid of avoiding such a troublesome person who is resistant to the door. After the assault company’s former company commander did not know why he did not want to work with a formal lieutenant, Benson decided to hand over the entire assault to Nanimen, which is the only thing he has done related to him. For the rest of the year, the division commander rarely talked about the logistics department and the assault company. Compared with the military affairs, it is more important for the Benjamin Major to communicate with Kengal’s dignitaries and officers of the staff headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, even the Central Military Staff did not think about the big things of the more than 7,000 people of the Fifth National Division. They exist here. The meaning is merely to declare the existence of the Central Army and the friendly attitude towards Kengler...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is as cranky as usual, and slowly tastes the breakfast. Ruhrock bread is different from the bread that was eaten in Fort Vatican. The more coarse grains are mixed, and the taste is also awkward. Benson walked up to his table with a tray of ham and cheese and sat down opposite him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Recently, your assault is still okay, there is resistance to the door? I am still very relieved about the logistics."<br /><br />&nbsp [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" was slightly surprised and responded: "Oh, okay, I am thinking about making some tactical improvements recently. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals have been indulging for a moment, and then stuffed something into their mouths and continued: "The recent Kengal election, you are still raising your heart." If Kengal is going to make a disaster, killing it with the Imperial Advisors in the north of the city, I am afraid that we can't stop it. In case something happens, your company is our only reliance, and it takes time for the remaining troops to enter the preparation state. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be impossible? There are only three thousand symbolic people in the Imperial City, and they are impossible to do. Here again, it is also the territory of the Republic. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this politician general will actually talk about military affairs Strange, but the door is still resistance in accordance with their own views to cope with the boss. Benson did not continue this topic, just talked a few words about the recent election, and left after eating breakfast. As soon as he left, other officers also followed. Only the door is still standing still on the chair, waiting for someone to arrive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, everyone! Is there still left today? Yeah, the ham seems a bit cold...heating!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne; Reese; Lieutenant Sefer never wears a helmet according to the military regulations, and the short blond hair that is full of youthful vitality can be seen in a few hundred steps. What's more, if you leave this dazzling practical lubricant, the efficiency of the logistics department is likely to be reduced by half or more immediately. From her appearance, she can't see her actual ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, Annie. I said, you must come in after the younger generals have gone." See Annie coming over with a plate, resistant The door smiled helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I don't want to march on them. I don't wear a helmet, and the military ceremony is not standard. This weather is so cold with the ear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde girl took the plate and walked close to her right hand and sat down beside him. She held the arm of the plate and the arm vertically, and the action standard was like a hotel waiter, but the piece of ham that was licking between the lips showed her nature. Seeing her look, sometimes Nami really doubts whether she is an adult as she claims to be - he knows that many girls aged fourteen or five look maturer than her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This morning, the teacher asked about the assault company. He took care of us to strengthen the training."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "He asked about the assault company?... It really didn't suit his style. I thought that no one would ever ask anymore after transferring the company commander." Annie swallowed the ham and drank it. After answering a large piece of porridge, "Say, do you have any time in Sorelton today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door carefully judged the intention of the girl in front of me, Carefully dodge: "Today? Since the teacher has mentioned it, then I think I should arrange for intensive training..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Training? Just right, today I am still in town. It’s really about training. The magic items that were ordered in pure gold last time should also be sent.” Anne did not hesitate to reverse the meaning of his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait, wait! What should I do with the training? And, is this thing going to be with two people?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? Do you think a lady can move so many things, Sorelton?" Annie stared at him with a look of surprise and request. In less than three seconds, Naimeng surrendered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Let's go together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Annie quickly At the end of the breakfast, I pulled up Soledon’s hand and went out to the door. “You have to tell me that it’s good, and I’ll train myself until 3 pm.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Endurance can't find what he should say. In fact, she is the last reason he was excluded... It is always difficult to work with military idols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hours later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please note to the citizens that the vote has ended and please leave the polling station. Observers from the South and the North will supervise the voting and the ballot box. Recycling, please help all citizen groups to maintain order..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteers riding horses come and go loudly at polling stations to remind voters The horseshoe splattered a lot of stains in the black mud after snowing. The posters, known as "Chase; Brighton's Great Ambition", and the posters of smashing comics that can only be called "shows of all kinds of mentally handicapped patients" are all over the street, and you can see Ruhrock Autonomy everywhere. The party’s slogan “Jurrock is above everything else”. The Federal Party, supported by Lenny, is also very popular. The rental carriages are lined with banners with "unbreakable alliances". Most of the banners are covered with thin snow. In contrast, the Liberal Party, which is also a coalition government, is not so high-profile. Nikolay, once so terrible; Machiavelli is like giving up this election. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably under-funded?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed to the seated door for customers On the resting chair, I boringly looked at the newspaper I just bought, waiting for Anne to struggle out of the quagmire in front of the jewelry counter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his feet is a black suitcase containing twenty-four lead deflectors that can create a biasing field, and twelve It is possible to dig up a trench for a quick digging in a minute – this is obviously another new experimental equipment that Anne used to invest in the “Blue Diamond” Kengler branch. Now the total number of magic equipment in this assault company is more than five times that of the standard assault company. The number of combat pharmacies assigned to each person is more than one dozen. Each officer has several scepters, amulets and the like on hand. Things are used to support operations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne wore half of the stained-glass glasses on her right eye, and looked at the collections of the jewelry store one by one, and boldly bought all she liked. The look was like a poor maid who suddenly slammed the rich man to show off his wealth. Resist the door uncomfortably flipping the newspaper under the eyes of the apprentices in the jewelry store, listening to the slogans of the various citizen groups outside, and trying to make the calm look of the gold master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 16 editions of today’s election special issue, which discuss the possible countermeasures of the new government. The current situation is that in a total of one hundred seats, there are forty-one in the autonomous party, twenty-six in the federal party, and thirteen in the Liberal Party. The ratio of the two sides is forty-one to thirty-nine. The remaining 20 seats in Kengler are enough to reverse the overall situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Summary, how much now?" "One thousand and one thousand pounds, noble lady." "A fold, nine thousand pounds?" Ten thousand pounds? Nine thousand is too low..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While bargaining, Anne pulled out the wallet and lit a thick piece of it inside The 100-pound bill of the seal of the Brothers Bank. Halfway through, her face changed slightly and turned to find the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry to disturb. Can you lend me some money, Sorelton?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, how much?" "Two thousand pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the astounding number in his adjutant’s mouth, the door was sucking a cold air, almost Just tear the newspaper in half. With his monthly salary of more than one hundred pounds, even if he does not eat or drink in the next two years, he may not be able to lend the money. He smiled and replied: "Sorry, I don't have that much money today, less envious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way..." Anne, who was slightly disappointed, turned her head. Go, pay the banknotes to the boss first, then come over and sit next to the door, it seems to be waiting for someone to send money. Resist the door and cough twice, remove the newspaper in his hand and hand it to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, thank you." Annie took the newspaper and quickly browsed the subtitle. "Do you want to have a victory between the autonomous party and the Federal Party today?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the results are published at two in the afternoon. More than 50% of the people will be in power alone, otherwise they will be in power with the Liberal Party." I smashed the clock in the store. "There is still one and a half hours. There should be dozens of local councillors in the observation group to supervise the inspection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" There is no difference. No matter who wins, Kengal’s calm will be broken.” Anne thoughtfully said, “The question is who is going to break. Want to give it a try, Soledon?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is water in the mouth now, the door will be sprayed in the newspaper in his hand. He lowered his voice and quickly asked: "You, are you kidding? I don't want to be a historical sinner!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be so excited, just a joke You should have more sense of humor.” The blonde girl closed the newspaper and stood up and chuckled. “Ah, I am waiting for someone, it’s really fast.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems like a disappointment in her tone. Looking at the door to the door, I saw a handsome and elegant young man wearing a high-rise coat and a white top hat. He looked familiar. Although the snow has stopped outside, the young coats and hats are all wet, so I have been braving the wind and snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You suddenly came to me, what happened?" The youth took off the hat and handed it over to the store owner who had already gone to the front, revealing a fluffy brown curls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss saw his face, stunned, and then exclaimed: "Luther assistant official? You, your visit is really a small shop Fluffy... Yes, I, I voted for your Federal Party! I absolutely don’t support Chase’s King!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your support.” The young man’s face showed a professional smile of the politician. “I hope that you will continue to support us in the future.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear the owner’s name, resistance The door remembers who this person is. He lowered his head and flipped the newspaper quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pluto; Luther, a prominent Federal Party member with superb financial ability, was the right-hander of Machiavelli, and later joined the Federal Party, now the Federation The identity of the party maintains the alliance between the Federal Party and the Liberal Party. In the past few months, this dazzling political star has relied on imperial loans and bank loans to sort out Ruhrlock’s finances and unify the banknotes of various banks, which has become the second person of the Federal Party. He has a very strong connection with Miss Casco's brother, and can be said to be a person with a solid credit guarantee. Other banks are also willing to trust him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That... I didn't bring enough money, only you can help me nearby. You should have two thousand pounds on your body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear her words, youth An unbelievable expression on the face of the politician. "You, you called me for this kind of thing, Anne?! I thought it was something to be done!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a bit too." Anne Spit the tongue, "Right, let me introduce. This is my boss, the door to the door; Lieutenant Soledon. You should know him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh? It turned out to be him..." Luther carefully looked at the door that was hiding behind the newspaper for a moment, whispering to himself, and the sharp eyes made the door feel a little uncomfortable. He took the initiative to reach out. "I am Pluto; Luther, Miss Sefer's... cousin. I am honored to meet you, Mr. Soledon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Hello, I am honored to meet you." Responsible to leave the newspaper and stand up, cramped the hand of the famous politician in front of him. He couldn't conceal his surprise: he really couldn't see what this person had in common with his adjutant. "Hello is Anne's watch... cousin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, a little relative, be a cousin."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther took a banknote from his pocket and handed it to the owner. When the owner was happy to get the goods, Anne whispered something closer to Luther's ear, and he responded seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is hiding in the side of the door, watching the strange brothers and sisters exchange, and incorporating this newly acquired information into their own judgments. The person he has known for so long has a cousin who is a famous politician? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about it, he thinks it’s no surprise. Although she is rampant in the camp, the efficiency and ability of Anne to do things is beyond reproach. Such talents - still young and beautiful women - will go to this third-rate force, and it is true that there should be such a degree of reason to match. Strange magic goods stores and consortia, repeated encounters on strange occasions, and the sudden emergence of politicians, the general election of Jules...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the teenager feels Difficulty breathing. Why did he run into this trouble? Could it be that...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She likes me?" If this is true, he will be a little happy. But this is obviously impossible. She obviously has access to the same-sex nature of Luther and will not have any interest in him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She agrees with my ability?" She, or they, want to absorb his strength? This is really arrogant. He asked himself to be a normal ordinary caster, a nameless pawn, and thousands of officers like him in the Free Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She is in the war to control a force to help Luther?" This is a reasonable judgment. conspiracy? Danger? Give it a try. In his current situation, every opportunity must be seized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this decision only happens in a flash. Resistance to the door; Soledon is unlucky, inexperienced, and often erring, but these do not mean that he lacks the ability to think or dare to take risks. When Anne and Luther ended the conversation and came to him, he had already put on a well-thought-out look, whispering like a famous adventurer in a legendary novel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When should we interfere with the events of Kengler? Let me tell you the content of the commission, Miss Aide."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde girl and the handsome young man looked at each other and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Passed. It is...you can tell him the action plan, Anne. I can't leave too long now, go first." Luther said After two words that taught people to be confused, they made a snap to Annie and left quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne shrugged and shook her head slightly, lowering her voice and telling her plans in the ear of Soledon. It was a plan to trample on this democratic election, but neither the narrative nor the listener had any real plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as the autonomous party wins, we will do our utmost to escort him and Machiavelli to the city and plan the next move." Even if Brighton really won the election, we can't let him get the entire Ruhrlock - at least, the finances still have to be controlled in our hands. If we can't control the finances, we will destroy the finances here." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
