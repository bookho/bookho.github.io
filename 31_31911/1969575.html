The wind is blowing from all directions, and the wind flows from all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reese; Quillahia is falling. Falling in the magical wind of the world's most powerful natural disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fall from an altitude of 12,000 meters above sea level. It takes 49.5 seconds to fall from here to the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a darkness in the eyes, and there are countless rainbow colors in the darkness flowing. There are thousands of colors that can be recognized by the human eye in the wavelength range of visible light, all of which are grouped together to form a pure picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there is severe pain, from the internal organs to the five senses and limbs, the pain of the whole body - falling into the magma or acid, is this feeling? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This world, have you heard her wishes? She didn't know, she didn't know. Is the magical science achievement of two hundred and fifty years in front of nature still unbearable? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind of the wind slid across the skin--don't worry about maintenance. Huge power tore her arm, but she would never let go of her hand - all her holdings in her hand. Her spiritual sustenance, and her only relatives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past began to appear uncontrollably in less than a minute. The length of this minute seems to be a century. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her birthday is the standard calendar June 12, 1868, and the birthplace is in the Keman capital DeLand. Both parents are middle class, and they have opened a shop in their homes and sell small magic items. Quillah (Qul is an elf surname, the reason why it has such a surname seems to be because the ancestor of human beings has been awarded the name of the "Hordin of the Hurrina" by the elf.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancestor once resisted the "Dark Emperor" Arthur for the Elves; the invasion of Coleman--from the perspective of the Holy Coman Empire, this man was the founding emperor of the Empire-- This is the honor of the elf. Of course, like all hero stories, he also attracted a beautiful elf woman and got her surname Quillahia. However, it was already 1,500 years ago. Old age. When passed down to her father's generation, the family's body has no trace of the elves, how to see them are ordinary humans.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She The memories of childhood are not too many. I only remember that I had a younger sister when I was four years old. This time it is pure brown hair--a beautiful brown curly hair like my mother. So my sister’s name is Mai Li Yana, a fairy name. ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; In short, a capable father, a gentle and virtuous mother, her childhood life is basically happy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......6 seconds, 7 seconds.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was able to hear the sound of time flowing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she was five years old, the mainland war broke out. Of course, the father who is a reserve officer left his wife and daughter, and took photos of his family in his arms. He was in the army. She was holding a doll, and next to her mother with her sister, she was watching at the train station booth. The father left. She could still clearly remember the conversation when her parents left tears to say goodbye:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t take our photo?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? If the war is prolonged, you will not be able to see you for a long time. When I think of you, you can see the photos..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"A soldier with a photo of his family or fiancee is bound to die! I can't allow you to bring that kind of thing!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm...well, okay! Then don't bring it... Don't worry, I won't die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This sentence is also a forbidden sentence, can not say! Be sure to come back alive! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later facts proved that certain laws are very effective. At that time, Reese did not know that it was the last time she and her father met. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war took place for six years. The empire won three years and lost three years. In the fourth year, the Quillahiya family received a notice from the army. The person who sent the notice was a young captain officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I am your husband's former subordinate. Madam, there is a bad news to tell you. You must be mentally prepared."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother did not say a word, just kept crying, took the notice, and tore it without breaking it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister, why is the mother crying?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time she was 9 years old, I am already sensible, and I know why my mother will cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's because Dad went to a very far and far away place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, will Dad come back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of her sister's question, Reese can't answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is the young captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, he went far and far. The capital of the elves, Hongrinasti! The guy betrayed our action plan, And the beautiful Elf female agent ran away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the sisters' mothers fainted in a flash. The facts happening in the world are always more bizarre than the tragic novels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, ah, madam, are you okay?! I told you, you must be mentally prepared..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......21 seconds, 22 seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should have exceeded the cloud. If the magic wind has disappeared, you can probably see the sea below directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the days that followed, their mother and daughter could only live together. Probably because of the concern and compassion for this family, the captain often went to their homes to ask for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation of the war is getting worse and worse, and the bombers began to visit the imperial capital. Her small shop was also ruined in a bombing. Since there was no insurance, the family suddenly broke the source of the economy. If there is a captain, I am afraid that the three have long been starved to death in the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, the enemy entered DeLand, and the captain never appeared again. One morning, my mother went to receive relief food and did not return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She deliberately forgot that period of time, no longer want to think of it. No longer want to remember the days when my sister was shivering in the corner of the refugee camp. Fortunately, that period did not last long - the Coman soldiers outside the refugee camp were replaced by Allied soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"War orphan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded hard and squeezed out Tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry! The Allies are the righteous army. You and your sister can have a new life and a compulsory education! All war orphans can be free. Get college education!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembered that she laughed at the time, she was 11 years old that year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--A long time later, Reese received an email from the New World, where the mother and the captain’s smile were very bright. The facts happening in the world are always more bizarre than the tragic novels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, she occasionally feels awkward, and she does deceive the good Allied logistics staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the parents of Quillahia students? Is it just a high school student!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, I am her eldest elder. We are two war orphans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Genius?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meliyahna has both genius and genius of arcane and magic. Unlike the 'double repair' in the general sense of the upper half, your Sisters can use these two kinds of magic in the same way. This kind of person is generally called 'double class' instead of 'multi class', which is one of the 100,000 people. I think she should not enter the public middle school. Going on, but should enter the real elite school to deepen the magic. She will definitely enter the arbitration association in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...So, is that school tuition expensive? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think that Melia Yana can get a scholarship, so I only need a small amount of money."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlyana’s teacher said a number. Reese didn't remember what she did after that, it seemed to be a night in the place where her former home was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister, are you not in college?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need...I am It’s not very useful to go to college, and I hate history and magic experiment classes, and I don’t want to be reprimanded by those professors.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she became An insurance salesman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......38 seconds, 39 seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the best memory, that is the most reminiscent of memories. I always feel that it is a happy day, but every time I want to play, I will burst into tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth year of her insurance sales career, she met him. From that moment on, her fate changed radically and drove into a completely different route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she became the elite of the Arbitration Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, due to her outstanding contribution to the exploration of the outer plane, she was appointed as a visiting professor at the Durham High School of the Orchard (adlversityadvanced ar.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, she was elected as an executive member of the association.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, she is doing something important, but no one really The research work she needs. She and her sister are the world's top magic researchers, representing the forefront of modern science.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She decided to... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as there is a little change in wind direction, there will be a huge change in the speed of the ship. As long as there is a little change in fate, the world will be completely different.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......48, 49, 49.5 seconds. Very punctual.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resistance of the wind becomes the resistance of the water The huge impact hits the body - the huge impact of falling from -12,000 meters.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a darkness in front of you.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&n Bsp;&nbsp;A very familiar voice, it seems, asking what is in the ear; no, not only is it familiar. That is her own voice...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the reflection of her own spirit.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reese stunned and looked up at the sky. She saw the white light shrouded in everything.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything has entered the realm of spirit. It is a collection of all faiths in the world, that is a collection of all the spirits of the world, that is a collection of all wills in the world - It is also a collection of all the forces in the world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Your voice is sounding.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Rice; Quillahia." She replied with the same voice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where did you come from?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I came from DeLand. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to Beixinzhou."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete The most powerful magic in history."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hah, it’s all lies, it’s just a superficial answer. What is the desire in your heart? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stunned; and the voice continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are Reese; Quillahia. You come from a lonely world, going to a ridiculous world. You would rather give up everything, too Chasing the person's side. For this reason, you can sacrifice your youth to delve into magic and get out of the crowd. This is your real wish, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to go to the world where that person is. You want to see that person again."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed her greatest wish. In contrast, everything else, such as size, appearance, age, youth, and so on, are just ** and cannot be described as wishes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, you don't want to be alone and spend your life. You To change the world you are in. You need to go back to your youth and return to your youthful age. You want to be happy, and you want your sister to be happy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "It's all about dreams and fairy tales. But the world cannot allow the existence of such dreams and fairy tales."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She reorganized and proposed a rebuttal. The other party did not answer her positively, but instead asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, do you believe in fairy tales? Do you believe in fantasy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not believe. The world is not like that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, do you believe in magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic is Magic can be falsified. Magic is a science."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe this magic is fantasy in other worlds." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As a scientist, I don't deny this possibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, why are you? To deny the existence of this dream?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was speechless. That voice, smirked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are me, I am you. You are one, and I am everything. Then, start the real magic. Let yourself return to the perfect At the moment, let all the wishes come true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the magical wind erupts instantaneously and spreads out uncontrollably. She felt that countless sources poured into her body and flew out of her own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The rule of the world is that the spirit determines the power. Your spirit and will have been recognized, and your wishes will be realized."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, she opened her eyes, and there was a blue and a golden color in front of her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one silver chain hanging on the palm of your hand, and the soul stone that has become a common sapphire. She clung to the ordinary sapphire, which was evidence of her existence in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, all memories have become a thing of the past, like a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some wreckage of old-fashioned sailboats in the surrounding waters. Reese took a deep breath and used some of the remaining magical power to change some of the wreckage into a raft, and dragged herself and her sister's body up. Miley's magic is obviously over-consumption - she also noticed that her sister's body has changed considerably. Of course, she is also... It seems that the two are no longer like sisters, but like twins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
