			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xx<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crader; Lieutenant General Lopez stopped. As soon as he stopped, all the soldiers who had ordered him to order also stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of ten companies, thirty rows, one hundred and twenty classes, and one thousand five hundred elite soldiers! These 1,500 people are scattered into a battle formation and can stretch for several kilometers on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full fifteen guns, fifteen six-pound bullets! As long as the ten rounds of ammunition are fully fired, even if 10,000 soldiers are listed in a square, they will not be able to break through their barriers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge array, surrounded by the Supreme Court in the East Third District. The soldiers of the Klad group blocked the Central Avenue, blocked the first, third and fifth avenues parallel to the north of the Central Avenue, and blocked the second, fourth and sixth avenues south of the Central Avenue, blocking the north and the south. To the fourteenth, sixteenth, eighteenth, and twentieth streets. Every place where the main road meets the central avenue is placed with a "Craded gun", quietly parked there, waiting for the orders of their chief. The dwarves and humans of the cavalry company stayed in the middle of the battle, guarding their command posts and the staff officers there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if all the units of the Freedom Army are concentrated, it may not be possible to have a unit with more combat power than the "third independent artillery regiment." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in this huge array of sieges, there are only a hundred soldiers who are sparsely pulled. Most of the 100 soldiers belonged to the semi-formal National Guard, with low morale, poor equipment and low skill. They just had nowhere to go because they were surrounded, and they came back here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unit that has been broken up several times and suffered huge casualties in previous operations is the last remaining force of the Lennie defending army that launched the coup . They have not compiled and commanded, and the soldiers and officers do not know each other; the last company with a complete establishment has been broken up in the previous blocking operations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, these confused soldiers are just blindly following their highest sergeant. Regardless of the standard used, the defending army is no longer a unit with combat power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Director of the team who defeated the team; Major General Lemda, when they saw the other team’s team stopped, they went to the front of their team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two commanders finally met after the humble soldiers fought for a long time and flowed out of the blood that was difficult to measure - here on behalf of "justice" and " Before the Supreme Court of Justice. On one side is a middle-aged general with a cold face, and on the other side is a young and strong-looking officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are finally here, Clade; Lopez. I have been waiting for you for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I'm sorry to be late than expected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are very relaxed in their tone, as if they are winning. The distance between the two is about 80 meters. It is a little longer than the gun can reach; it is a little shorter than the distance of the sound. The distance between friends is much longer than that of a stranger; the distance between strangers is much shorter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will give you the last chance to surrender."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This sentence is returned as it is I will give you the last chance to surrender."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crad was somewhat surprised to hear such an answer. He pointed to the semicircular encircling net that had been completed behind him, and the fifteen shiny muzzles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you determined to die here?" he asked word by word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have no plans to go abroad. Of course, I am not kidding." On the face of Lymda, there is a well-thought-out smile. "Please allow I am a grand introduction, Clade; Lieutenant General Lopez, Miss Nika."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hand gently swayed, the defeat behind him will give up Road, two soldiers came out with a trolley. On the trolley, a vertical wooden pillar was nailed; the brown-haired girl was still in a coma and was tied to the wooden post. Behind Renee, four spears and the same number of muskets were prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long, long, long-term confrontation, no one knows how long it has been. In the end, it was Krad who broke the silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your intelligence agency is really good, and your actions are very determined."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You There are too few people sent to defend the St. Grace's Welfare Home. Join us, Lieutenant General Lopez? There is no need to make such a big sacrifice for this government!" Major General Lemda stirred up the tongue. "Is it really magical and tactical, so I don't want to see tragedies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responding to him is just silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you join us, we can build a new Free Army, a stronger steel lion than the Free Army 20 years ago!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to listen to empty words." Clad interrupted him coldly. "But how do I know that she is really my daughter, not you?" The illusion of a certain method? I want to see the evidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The pure energy flame in the air is not enough? Besides your daughter, who else can continue With so many pure flames?" Lymda spread his hands. "Fortunately, I have prepared for cold water, or else I really can't wake up the magical exhausted people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two barrels of cold water immediately poured on Reneka. The northeast wind of December blew, causing her body temperature to begin to fall. She sneezed and woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her face was frozen into a blue-purple, wet clothes on her body, showing the curve of her body, enough to show that she is not an illusion or similar presence. Renee struggled twice and found that she was completely free from the shackles behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first glance, she saw the father not far from the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl smiled bitterly and whispered: "I ended up losing. Sorry, father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Hearing "father", the middle-aged man's eyes flashed a little hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you give me some time to think about it?" He avoided the look of Renee, turned to the direction of the Major General, and still used the toneless voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Read and listen." Lemda smiled and turned back to the queue. The most important thing he lacks now is time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's snowing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hex star's elf falls on the blue-haired woman's pale On the tip of the nose, it did not disappear with the breath. Undead can be done without breathing, and the transformation has faithfully simulated this. Bonnie; Saphir drifted over the fourth wall on the north side, stopping at the moment before the fall, standing on the outermost platform and looking north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame industry has enveloped the fifth north side of the city wall, and countless torches are pouring into the central street. Clade; Lopez’s troops have all died, died of unexplained wounds, and the 10th Division’s storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go forward!" Radz; Govar's horse is still parked outside the city, but his troops have crossed the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it late...but I don't have the transmission coordinates of this era." The female pastor from the later generation complained that a light came from the left hand, which offset A black weak ray. Her body leaned back, licked the snow on the tip of her nose, and escaped two deadly bone spears. In any case, the flexibility of this body is really good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...arrowglory (Glory Arrow)!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden light on her right hand side It was fleeting and retaliated in the direction of the bone spear. There was nothing boring, because the target that was hit had turned into dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the fourth," she estimated, setting up a phantom to attract the other party's firepower, and I jumped off the wall to avoid the opponent's offensive. "There are five left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More than five." The other side of the Lich Bishop was dispatched, and the dry hand was heavily scribbled in the air. "Encircle her!! Try to catch it, we need her exact identity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although falling into a trap, Lenny's best Protestant pastor - no, it should be said that the world's best Protestant pastor is not flustered. Bonnie's deep purple nails gently draw two concentric circles on the front chest, forming a shining Protestant holy ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...armorholy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holy light of white is from that holy The center of the ring spread out and enveloped her whole body. Those horrible magic and super power attacks hit the white light shield and disappeared automatically, as if they had never been sent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible?! Does Protestantism have such a person?" The "bishop"'s yellow lips, which overlooked the city wall, opened and closed. The hoarse voice murmured the classic villain. In his deep eye socket, only two dark yellows were revealed, and it was not happy or worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the cover of the sacred armor, Bonnie made a hard road in the six different kinds of undead creatures that were chasing the interception. Strangely, there was no smug or joyful look on her face; she just took a burst of snow and rushed out of the encirclement of the "Knights." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich's yellow pupil narrowed: he noticed that the blue-haired woman's left leg was awkward. After all, even the sacred armor is not perfect to withstand all attacks forever; there is never an "absolute" thing in this world. If something is said to be absolute, then it must be wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Catch up, be sure to catch it!" "Bishop" immediately conveyed the absolute command of "King" to all eleven "Knights". For this action, he mobilized almost all of Lenny's "Knights" and "tax officials" - after all, the "bishop" murder is very rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems a bit too underestimating... Is this a historical reaction?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Bonnie talked to herself, dragging her injured leg and turning back to the south. Behind her is a huge and amazing number of enemies. The entire strength of the tenth division, as well as the twelve undead elites, are chasing behind her and seem to be able to swallow her at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this... history is not like this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anniwang Looking at the sight, I caught it. It was a crowd like a tidal wave, whispering the slogans such as "Peace for Peace" and "Anti-war", surging on the street. Everyone seems to be less normal and seems to be under the control of the spirit. Some emotions deep in their hearts are abnormally screened out and enlarged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie has stepped up and passed through the crowd. Too much, too much, it is too much! Within the scope of her eyesight, she has seen at least three vampires. History can never be like this, it is impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undead, or undead. She recognized that it was the undead who manipulated these people. Behind the scenes, the one that can mobilize the Lich... they don’t just mobilize the Lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because she chose the path of "expanding the coup to maintain history." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a choice that we can expand the coup by exposing the undead in the parliament and prevent Clad from winning too easily. Thus, history will not Too far from the right track, your love may also appear in this world..." The words of sister Bonnie reappeared in her ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking carefully, how reckless and ineffective this plan is... even if it is tolerant; Sorelton is really a Lenny, she goes to a place How can I just meet that person when I am fighting a fire? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does she trust her magic ability too much? Is she too trusting her strength? Has her judgment been blinded by love? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bonnie! Bonnie! Miley!" She tried to evoke the telepathy between herself and her sister. "How can things become like this?" !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No response, only dead silence. Annie frantically grabbed a few hairs and leaped onto the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no despair, we may still find that person. With our ability, it is not easy to eliminate these vampires? Wait a second time. Then go to the door of youth; Hugh; Coman! Love is sure to beat everything, absolutely!" A voice whispered in her ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She covered her ears and used flying and stealth to fly in the snow, moving forward and forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, impossible! That person must be there, he will definitely appear in history tonight! Otherwise, why will the wishing will send us? Come to this era? Just be patient and bear with it! It will take a lot of time and effort to eliminate so many vampires!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But all this It’s all caused by ourselves, and we are facing reality. 'The man’ has not been able to appear for a long time, and it is completely impossible.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two voices are still arguing She feels that her magical power is weakening. Faith, her belief in the pursuit of love has already shaken? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inner argument continues. One is a sensual voice and the other is a rational voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The man who will be the prime minister of the Holy Empire, endurance; Hugh; Coman, already dead--No, it should be said that he has never existed before "The voice of reason speaks in a cold voice, and the voice overwhelmed the first one." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! Do not! She felt cold and sweaty and shouted in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she acknowledges this fact, she is not a savior, but a selfish person who promotes coups and brings disasters for their own benefit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she admits this fact, she is not chasing her dreams, but just hypnotizing herself and letting herself chase the phantom paranoia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did I do? What did it become? What I did... are all correct?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She muttered to herself and finally flew over the Supreme Court to see the full picture of history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw Clade; all the main forces that Lopez had, and the coups who were surrounded by the coup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finally understood the purpose of the undead to gather this large group of civilians: the ring-shaped huge encirclement network, so that their intentions are clear. They want to use the innocent people to block the guns of the soldiers. Everything is in the name of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne; Seifer, no, it is Reese; Quillahiya stopped in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if Clade; Lopez is coerced by civilians? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw the victory of the coup army and saw the laughter of the undead. The free country sinks and the Holy Empire will regain control. The scientific spirit born in freedom will sink, the decaying religion will continue to control everything, and the whole world will sink in the crisis of the next history...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp What if he does not hesitate to attack civilians to suppress the coup? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw these early tanks run over unarmed people. Lenny will be destroyed in the war, countless innocent people will die, and chaos will cover the city for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this has her responsibilities...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endless choices and endless possibilities Come in, piled up in front of her. She must make a decision, must, must! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A large number of civilians are encircling us, and the liaison with the North City left-behind forces is also completely cut off. Add Ladz; Govar is clearly not in the encirclement. It can be concluded..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It goes without saying, the conclusion is obvious." Klad set his hand and stopped Hull; report from Major Tedwood . "Let the security forces turn the guns back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this order, Hull sighed and silently lowered his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I ask you a question? Why are you so loyal to the government, even if the government is not good?" he whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Some systems are destroyed and will not come back. If you want to rebuild, I am afraid to pay dozens of times of blood. If you have seen Huachao... ... forget it, this is too far off the mark."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked out of the array with his head high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Di Khao; Lymda, I made a decision." The middle-aged man's face only has a cold and sad expression. There are a lot more wrinkles on his forehead, and it looks like he is five years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general hurriedly greeted him: "Are you decided to join us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The answer is... ..." Kladton paused and glanced in the direction of his daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this long-awaited answer, Seneca’s The heart is full of calm, and the calm water is calm. When Clade turned and left for the first time, she guessed the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wooden stake behind it does not seem to exist, and it is not felt on the back. The most precious fingers for the Master are completely out of control, and she doesn't even know that others touch them. Every inch of skin on the body seems to only feel "numb". However, all of this together is not as cold as the feeling of her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you coming back, father..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the daughter can also be abandoned what. The full meaning of her 18 years of living in this world is just a sacrifice to her father's principles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure, Clade? That's your daughter, not an illusion! Do you have feelings?!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still can't give up. Sorry, I don't know." Listening to the cry of Dicouches, Clad blinked and turned and shook his arms. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good...you are embarrassed, hands-on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this sentence After that, Reneka’s eyes began to blur. The spear should have been stabbed in, why not feel it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She raised her head with the last gaze and looked up at the sky. In front of her eyes, the glory of the kingdom of heaven appeared, and the glare of the sun reflected her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably already numb it, she thought. Is this death? It is not terrible... on the contrary, it is very comfortable. The angel has lifted her hand and whispered in her ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...In your mind, go to a safe place! Hurry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The voice of the angel sounds like Soledon... safe place, okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl murmured, lost consciousness, and disappeared quietly It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know the butterfly effect, my sister? At the moment we appeared in this era, we were destined to be unable to control the direction of the wind."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Batish silk" slowly walked into his own mansion, his hand on the door, a huge sacred wall, and stopped the undead creatures chasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your vain love has long since disappeared... The facts are cruel, but that is the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took advantage of the time when she was fighting for the wall, and she began to arrange defenses quickly, on this battlefield of her own choice. The remaining former pirates and guards in the mansion were gathered together and prepared for defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome from the world of girl comics back to the real world, my sister. I have always believed that you can turn the tide; I have always believed that you will turn the tide."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl who made the totally illogical plan looked up and saw that the white light had been lifted by the outside invaders. The white light shattered into countless pieces, beautiful and dazzling. The enemy is about to rush in, and the total combat power of the twelve advanced undead creatures is clearly above her...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, it seems to be from the light of heaven Suddenly sprinkled over Lenny's sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
