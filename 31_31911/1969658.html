The core target of the shelling is the central highland of the Empire's defense, where there are also a few places that can conquer the city of Kangle. The highlands were the highlands that they stood by in the spring, and it was not too far from the town where the emperor defeated Hull’s main force during the second Kengal battle. Now it is easy to attack and defend, and it is the turn of the Free Army to take it back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne approved the use of all enchanted bombs, and also provided valuable additional ammunition and protective potions to the assault troops, trying to weaken the enemy's resistance at all costs. Although this shelling did not have the exaggerated wall of "making the high ground flat ten meters" in the afterlife war, it was enough to make all the equipment and defensive magic of the empire on the high ground become rubbish. But the shelling continued, and the tunnels and fortifications that had only minimal force defense were constantly being bombarded. Every five minutes, the shelling will stop for five minutes, giving the emperor a chance to add defense to the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually a gamble. If the shelling continues, most of these newly added defensive forces will be sacrificed in the next wave of shelling; but if they do not replenish the power of the position, the Free Army will launch a positive breakthrough and capture the entire position. In essence, this is like an auction on the auction floor and will continue until one party stops raising the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door stands on the wait-and-see whistle and observes the situation of the opponent's recruitment of soldiers. The commander of the South detachment, Pluto; Colonel Luther stood not far from him, and also looked at the enemy positions with a telescope. In front of this huge casino, everyone is very nervous, for fear of accidentally losing the light. There are only 10,000 opponents, but they also have less than 20,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you stop the bombardment? Today has bombarded eight rounds, much longer than the usual three rounds. The opponent's counterattack stopped as early as the third round. It should be fine." The first to propose to stop the shelling is Anne. In order to save some of the artillery shells in the future, she was convinced that she was offered a surprise attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a second. The opponent’s last round of supplements still has more than a hundred people, and they haven’t reduced their investment.” Colonel Luther looked across the hillside. Those black spots that shuttled, ordered, "They don't withdraw, we just follow. Play two more rounds... No, three rounds. Ten rounds are too easy to guess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence delayed the attack for another half an hour. For many people, this has extended their lives for an additional half an hour. The empire really filled in additional forces during the tenth round of shelling, and these forces clearly hit the muzzle. Just as the defenders began to prepare for the eleventh replenishment with grief and anger, all the light artillery suddenly silenced for half a minute, and then neatly hit three short shots without aiming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s coming." Nana took a deep breath and looked at his watch. 11:10 am. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the secret sign of the assault. Two groups of more than two thousand soldiers who had already prepared for the leaping from the trenches, carrying guns and swords, rushed to the opposite enemy positions. The heavy artillery group adjusted the ruler and began to roar against the emperor's assembly area and the guns behind the high ground, trying to smash each other's reinforcements and command systems. The hundreds of emperors who survived the shelling plucked their heads from behind the fortifications and slammed the opposing enemy forces. The light artillery of both sides pushed forward and began to directly support their own fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the previous bombardment, they added twelve companies, is there such a thing left?" Luther asked strangely. "The shelling seems like a few days ago. There is no such great effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, Annie proudly raised her head: "This time we have invested a lot of money." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which is it? Unless the opponent does not move the Air Force, we have a chance - but that is impossible." Ningmen sighed, "They There is not enough gunfire to achieve a partial firepower breakthrough, only by the elite squad penetration and air strikes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is not your plan ?Take the dragon out," Annie reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both sides are too familiar with each other's tactics and regulations. As long as they see the movement of each other's company, they can understand what the other party wants to do. Everyone knows that the Emperor's Silver Dragon was the last resort of the Imperial Kegler Legion. Almost as the shelling extended to the distance, several black spots appeared above Kengal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver dragons arrived on time as expected, and their wingspans broke through the eastern sky. The morning sun stayed behind the emperor and his air force, and they broke into the battlefield from east to west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s finally here." The door closed his eyes and couldn’t bear to see the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment the dragon swept through the battlefield, there was a loud cheer on the opposite side. All the emperors who were still alive sang their national anthems while fighting and paid tribute to the emperors in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The freedom army that was still bravely advancing is one of the best. The silver-clad knights cast magic from the dragon's back, attacking the Freedom Infantry, who had no artillery cover, no magical support, or even a bunker. More than 2,000 soldiers were exposed to the dragon knight's hunting--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The militia division's "war" battle paused on the first fortress line Only the best soldiers of the first "Steelburg" division rushed into the enemy's defense system. But this did not help, more enemies shouted the emperor long lived, from the deeper cover up, drowning them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are in the doldrums and are not supported by reinforcements, but relying on fortifications, relying on the air superiority and high morale brought by the emperor, their situation Not in a disadvantage. The Free Army must pay a higher price every time it goes further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you come yet?" Nanamen continued to look at the watch, "It's late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;five minutes. ten minutes. twenty minutes. The pocket watch of the combat staff walked tickingly, calculating the death and injury and the emperor's magical consumption. Finally, from the position of the warriors, soldiers began to collapse in groups of three. There were cheers and louder songs in the position of the emperor, and their reserve teams marched forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the emperor’s silver dragon left the middle ground and began to advance toward the artillery position of the Free Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, the sky in the south has changed color. At that moment the sky seemed to be very blue, just like someone spilled blue fluorescent fuel into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11:35 am. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Colonel Luther, the monster has already entered the cage!" Nanimen looked at the signal from the Southern Allied Forces and jumped from the lookout tower. Holding the pocket watch tightly in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The order is passed, the frontline forces are looking for cover and turn into the defensive, all the casters are all!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp From the south side of the emperor's position, the sound of shelling came. The magical beam of flashing across the sky is as beautiful as a meteor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Clade; Lopez’s General Reserve, the Magic Corps plus more than 20 Clade self-propelled guns, which are also owned by the entire Western Army. Mobile force. Many officers came from Gistov by sending magic, and they had a comfortable night in Gistov. Standing on the first Clade cannon, stood the commander of the entire Northwest War. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The strategists of the Stilburg Army, I am the commander of the Western Army, Klad; Lopez. A little later, sorry. All the casters Prepare for interception, victory and defeat in one fell swoop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This order was transmitted along the Freedom Army's order network distributed in a semicircle on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle entered the second stage, all work was suspended, and both sides’ attacks and defenses stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front line officers are nervously preparing magical missiles and force missiles, while the school officials find their magic books and read the unfamiliar super magic skills. Prepare to kill the opponent's air cavalry after the eunuchs cut their opponent's protective magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each group of defenders has at least four people, each with the same distance. The stations in each group form an equilateral triangle, and the equilateral triangle constitutes a hexagonal star. No matter which angle the opponent's air force hits next time, it will be completely hit by the magic of at least three groups of people. If the dragon's magic is strong enough to fight these attacks, Lopez's total reserve will give it a fatal blow. This is a space-defending plan with a margin to keep the enemy air force out of the theater. If the emperor really gives up fighting, his subordinates will collapse under the pressure of both the north and the south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deep defense command, intercepting the enemy air force! The North Wing is under the responsibility of the Steele Army! Repeat, deep defense command, must intercept the enemy air force..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The officer of the interception group whispered the password, preparing for the magic of the interference and the magic of the blow. The emperor's dragon group hovered over the battlefield, arranging the word "i" for a while and "y" for a while, and seemed to be watching their actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the dragon selected the most threatening heavy artillery group as the first target, rushing with eight dragons. As soon as the dragon group entered the low altitude that could be touched, the first group of wizards opened fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few can see such a grand welcome ceremony. The attackers shot colorful rays and crossed the silver dragon. The deadly elements were intertwined into a fire net, but they lacked the minimum accuracy. The magic missiles that disturbed the hands took off from seven or eight different points, and they only wiped from the emperor's side. The delayed hands fired various magics of slowing down, cursing, and paralysis, setting invisible obstacles in the air to provide better conditions for others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all these attacks are not comparable to the power of the dragon, and the silver dragon is still gliding dexterously. It danced a spiral trajectory in the air, and the knight of the silver cymbal danced the scepter to block the occasional one or two leaking rays and swooped down without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All lying down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was so low that he could throw a fireball, the soldiers They fell down in horror. A continuous explosion was wrapped around them, and the eight knights behind the silver dragon also swooped down and threw more magic and impact javelins. The entire artillery position was like a immersive dance in the sea of ​​fire. The three-pound and six-pound shots were thrown into the air, and the enchanted engraving of the spell exploded in the same place. The storm passed over the bunker and there were several noises from time to time. The scream of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen or so screams came, and the mage who was responsible for the sniper mission finally opened fire. When the Silver Dragon Knight responded and ordered the formation to pull up, the team behind it had lost a quarter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mage was killed in the air, and the other was entangled in paralyzed magic, and even the dragons slammed into the enemy infantry, apparently fierce . The knight whispered, and the silver dragon rushed straight away, with the remaining dragon flying out of the enemy magician's range of resistance, and returned to the medium height hovering. Just like mocking them, the Freedom Force's spare heavy artillery positions immediately took over the task of the previous position and continued to bombard the highlands. The hovering dragon seems to be wrong, and I don’t know where to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are they retreating?" Anne rushed to the tower, the equivalent of the door to meet here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first attack was stronger than we expected, and the emperor hesitated." Ningmen replied, "He has not decided where to attack, direct assault The probability of our command is about half. The remaining options are to go to attack the generals of Lopez on the southern line, continue to attack our heavy artillery, or retreat..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice just fell, the emperor's silver dragon suddenly jerked up and pulled up to hundreds of meters high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie Shen said: "At least it won't be a retreat. He can also choose to support their morale here until they can't support it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noon at noon, everyone can clearly see the trajectory of the dragon flying. The remaining dragons could not be pulled up to such a height, they hovered at a slightly lower position, watching the free army's offensive preparations. This action has only one meaning: it is a dive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Battle Manual says that dive means precision attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Masters nervously repeated the preparation of the mantra, and the priests morally recited the names of the gods. The entire battlefield held his breath, waiting for the emperor, his silver dragon to breathe and the dive of the "power" in his hands. If the Freedom Masters can stop him, they will be able to win the entire war; if they can't stop him, they will lose the command, all the heavy artillery or most of the casters. What people need is just a momentary goal. A goal that is enough for them to use all the magic. The stalemate lasted for twenty minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The second wave of attack, forced him to shoot!" Luther finally could not help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deafening heavy artillery group began to sing again, and the smoke covered the position of the emperor. The light of speeding up magic and inspiring magic has come and gone, and the free-spirited people jumped out of their own way, rushing toward the enemy's position like a wave. The drums of the rifle and the light cannon sounded, and they were mixed in the rhythmic bombardment of the heavy artillery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is almost no magic cover attack. God." Annie quietly closed her eyes and couldn't bear to see it all. "Do we have to pay such a big price?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen heard this sentence. He whispered in search of the vocabulary: "I don't know. If it succeeds, there is peace..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's worth it. For peace, this It’s worth it.” A magnetic baritone answered their questions without hesitation. “If you can get peace, you can get peace. What the price is worth it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General Lopez...?" Luther stepped forward and sighed. "All our commanders are here, the risk is too great! The other party has a 'power'!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Oriental said that it is impossible to catch a tiger without entering the tiger's lair." Lopez smiled. "I have heard the power for a long time, but I really want to Look at this contemporary's strongest artifact."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver light solidified. The emperor’s mount started high and swooped down from the setting sun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone raised his head and stared at the silver flight path. The dragon rushed toward their command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods." The door grabbed Annie's shoulder. "He rushed over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;All eyes are on the silver dragon. At least one mage in each squad is preparing for the momentary deceleration magic, and more people are preparing for the strongest attacking magic of their own: they are trying to make the magic they use different from others - that is the last It will be useful when it comes to rewards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, no order is needed - because the silver light itself is the order! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the name of freedom...open fire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dozens of different color energy balls At the same time, the ray and the magical missiles are shot like the arrows of the strings, and even the guns of the ordinary soldiers are blindly watching the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this chaos, no one can see the position of the emperor Yinlong, but this has no way to stop their eager eyes. It seems that it is not a silver dragon, but the greatest credit in the history of the Free Army. The Medal of Freedom and the Medal of Excellence seem to be waving to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person walks on the ground, and the dragon flies in the air, since ancient times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are allies with the dragon, some are still on the ground, so they have rulers and rulers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor and the silver dragon are naturally set off against each other. The emperor always uses the most magnificent and majestic magic, and the people who resist him can only use the ordinary powers that are least powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silver Dragon swooped down, ignoring all resistance. After the full 80 magical missiles hit the silver dragon's anti-magic shield, the invisible shield was just beginning to tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the dragon shouted. The dragon also has the ability to use magic, but the method used is different from humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is anti-magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first batch of shooting and deceleration magic does not make People were accidentally all offset. The huge magical light is released from the scepter in the hands of the knight, and together with the magic of the silver dragon itself constitutes a compound defense system. The magical missile of the tracking class hits the wall of the force energy, and the refracting hood destroys the accuracy of the radiation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon swooped down and rushed to the most dense direction of the Rain of Magic. The "power" waved and evoked countless silver-white wingspans, all under the awesome light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the cover of the angels. These summoning creatures, which also emit silver light, confuse the target and obscure the true position of the dragon. They fired silver shots and shot at the same time, flying with the rays attacked by the Freedom Masters. Rays and silver guns passed by in the air, each hitting their own target - the only difference is that one is a magic shield and the other is a flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie heard the explosion and shook his head with a bitter face: "You have to apply for two more bases of ammunition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Robert, let the teams leave the gun The car is far away! Change the magic, use the physical magic!" Clade, who just leapt away from a shot, did not hesitate to order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther immediately followed: "Press General Lopez to change the physical magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are still many mages who have not shot before, and their attacks constitute the second round of fire nets. This time the magic is no longer focused on quantity, but replaced by quality. One hundred rounds of arrows that couldn't shoot through the armor were far less than a bullet that could penetrate it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is no longer a fast ray and missile, but a slow, massive energy ball or casting magic with possession. The ice blasts they launched were connected to each other, forming a beautiful grid that blocked the space around the silver dragon. The jet of particle rain is parabolically sprinkled in the air, which looks like a colorful glass ball that reflects the rainbow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of these powerful magic, even the emperor did not dare to resist. The silver dragon flies right in the air and draws a spiral of clouds in the colorful jet of particle rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice crystal grid set by the delayed hands was directly crushed by the silver dragon, which cleverly calculated the track of tracking magic, so that the dangerous goods that were tracked hit On the ice around. Emerald acid, crimson fire, sea blue ice, reflected in the crushed ice crystals, looks like thousands of dead flowers in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silvery hovering in these fireworks, no damage. Its activity space is so vast and its movements are so flexible that hundreds of mages can't pose any threat to it. After most of the magic has expired, Silver Dragon begins to dive again - it is clear that the Emperor has found the most important goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Discipline! Discipline! Delayed hand fire again!" The power of Silver Dragon made Colonel Luther's face change a bit, and Bonnie began to seriously consider it. The possibility of joining the team in person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are we going to attack, Bonnie?" Anne's mind communication sounded in a timely manner, and Bonnie's forehead wrinkled more tightly. It would seem feasible to start building her power from the hero of the war, Bruto; Luther...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guy is too flexible...Robert, Your sword supports me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lopez's order made her dismiss the idea. Today’s general commander is undoubtedly Klad; Lopez, not Pluto; Luther, letting the war end here is harmful to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, keep watching!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficult air defense battle continues, the free army begins Realize why the other side dares to rush into the most defensive airspace with no fear. The second wave of delaying magic was thrown out, forming several walls in the air, but the dragon could still find a gap in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the emperor was only 20 meters away from the ground, and his dragon took a deep breath and spewed a silver flame from his mouth. The silver flame gradually condensed and condensed into a sphere that ancient geologists called "perfect three-dimensional". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert holds "justice" and unfolds the sacred shield, guarding most of the commanders. When he saw the silver ball, his tone was scared very rarely: "General, the emperor wants to use the dragon! Don't let it be used!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame of the silver dragon It is called "the breath of the dragon" by the average person, and it is one of the most magical changes in the freedom of the military. It is a flame that cannot measure temperature, because it is a kind of will, a belief, a symbol of a country. The silver dragon flame symbolizes the "Keman of the Koman rule" and symbolizes the glory of the empire's millennial orthodoxy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only weakness of the dragon that can't be resisted by the flesh and blood is just the range. Because the power is too great, the dragon's interest will not be more than thirty seconds in a spherical shape, and the coverage from the high altitude will not exceed ten meters - which is why the dragon always dive or attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." Clad whispered, "Breaking Dreams!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;天蓝The ray of light shrouded him all around, and countless tiny pieces flew around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue-violet light illuminates one by one on those little swords. Clade waved his hand and the pieces were neatly arranged behind his back. All the sword tips pointed to the silver dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Raise the flag! All fire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top wave of the hand, countless blue light Start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment of this blue light rain hit, the silver dragon stopped like a stone ball hit by a heavy hammer. Then, it made a completely impossible movement - the silver dragon dragged a trajectory backwards and upwards against the previous flying direction, which was more than ten meters high! The last violent defensive magic of the dragon flashed a dazzling white light, overshadowing the faint light of the silver dragon itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sword can pierce this defensive magic, but the silver dragon can't move at all. The space anchor attached to the countless little swords fixed it to death and became a living target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open fire! Delay hand, second wave!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More magic missile hits In defense, this time they all hit the attack. Numerous colored lights eventually merged together, smashing on the emperor's protective magic, turning into a dazzling white light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sniper, second wave!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enjoy the magic, it is encouraged The Freedom Army casters concentrated their spirits and launched a more intensive attack. Although the ice crystal lattice in the air is not as much as the first time, it is more dense and more effective. The flashing white light quickly turned into yellow, red, and purple light, and it seemed to collapse at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the silver ball that the dragon gathers can no longer support, and slowly and slowly falls to the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the magic is gathered outside the emperor's protection, conflicting with each other; when the silver dragon that dissolves everything comes, all the magic comes together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone fires!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More magic shots. At the moment when all the magic meets -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a second sun in the sky that consists of a sword of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the center of this false sun, the knight on the dragon's back calmly smiles, and the "power" in his hand emits a silver glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I refuse! Absolutely disperse!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the absolute protection that can bounce all magic Body magic. Silver Dragon has been flying for so long, only for this moment, only for this special effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All direct magic lost its goal, drawing a beautiful arc in the air and flying to the far side. A wide range of attacking magic popped up in the sky, turning from white light to colored light, disappearing into the clouds. The second sun dissipated momentarily, and there was no magic left on the ground and in the air. Even Klad's flying sword and Robert's sacred shield lost their effectiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone was in a state of sorrow, Silver Dragon swooped down and went straight to Clade. The silver dragon opened its mouth and exposed the fangs. At this time, people remembered that the dragon could also be engaged in a close combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a desperate situation, even the famous such as Klad can not help but retreat two steps. He squatted down, sat down on the ground, smiled and faced the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at that moment, the dragon stopped and stopped for five seconds. It looked at the pair of huge eyes and the admiral, and seemed to have a slight hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, in a free military camp not far away, there was a soft female voice who pronounced a name in a voice that almost no one could hear. There is only one vowel in her pronunciation, and only one vocal has a slightly different vowel than the standard Coyman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marsavia, come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is only The sound that the dragon can hear - that is the only real name of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General Lopez, nothing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nelmen, Robert and Bonnie rushed over to check the situation, and several people slammed into the smoke. Bonnie's chest was touched, and she suddenly realized that her body's transformational magic was also cleared by the emperor, secretly stupid, and hurriedly restored the hidden appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clade wiped the cold sweat on his forehead and stood by and ordered: "The magic is restored! Chasing..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His order was stuck in his throat, because he saw the dragon's path plunged into the camp of the Freedom Army and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Colonel Luther, what's in your camp?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie also wiped Wiping sweat: "Not a lot, there are five days of grain, all gunpowder and captives..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly stopped and understood why the emperor had to give up the frontal battlefield. There must be some secret communication methods between the royal blood vessels...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...well, there is nothing to worry about. Are we going to pursue, sir?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cradd hesitated and looked at the opposite camp and shook his head. "If you don't have anything to do, just take some of your strength and go in. You and I seem to stay here. Robert, you go to the crowd and go to the camp to search."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Following." Robert's sword tip was shaking slightly. He also looked at the camp opposite him. He was worried. "I want to stay, can I?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Nana, you and Naomi are going well..." Bonnie asked the matter to her sister, and then looked at Clade's gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was surprised to find that the emperor had overwhelmed the positive Freedom Army and was coming to their position. The commander of the emperor no longer stayed in the reserve team, and all the units took the initiative to launch a counter-attack on death. From their queues, the sound of sings that swayed the world: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Emperor’s glory is extremely glory, and the glory shines on the earth..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have the courage to advance for the Coman flag!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This song is more solemn than the national anthem of the free country. The implied temperament is also more magnificent than the national anthem of the free country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your mind will unite the subjects forever..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In your Under the protection of prestige, all human beings become brothers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the assault troops probably also have two regiments, they are wearing silver military uniforms! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie first saw the military uniform and tried to ask: "Is that...the Royal Guard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kradd nodded. "They probably also used the transfer magic. I didn't expect them to keep this hand..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He once again recalled the look of the dragon, the ominous premonition is getting heavier and heavier. If the emperor rushes into their camp to boost morale, if the enemy retains the Guards for the counter-attack at this time, if the other party is interested in eliciting their full strength and then decisive battle...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After three rounds of assaults, they lost four or five thousand people, and the strength is no longer a big advantage. How long have you not experienced this tension? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a battle that cannot be lost for both of us, sir." Robert sighed. "This battle will determine the outcome of the war. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let them come! When things get to this point, they can only fight for strength, aren't they?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The famous monks who had been in the far east of the East laughed and laughed loudly, shouting loudly: "Citizens, killing the enemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Kill the enemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
