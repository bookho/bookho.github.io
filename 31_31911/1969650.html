This is an ordinary reconnaissance mission, but the Sixth Division of the Freedom Army, which was put together, is too lacking in magical users. It is only necessary to send the combat subordinates and the logistics subordinates to carry out such tasks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strongest bastion fortress on the ground consists of two stars, the inner fort is a five-pointed star, and the outer fort is also. Its foundation is a blue hill, and the engineering magicians use powerful magic to flatten all nearby hills that threaten it. Designed by the most prominent mages and priests of the empire, Neiburg is filled with clever institutions that use defensive magic and communication magic to connect with various departments; the low-sloping outer fort is designed and built by the fortress engineers and ballistic mathematicians of the Republic. Its firepower blocked the commanding heights of each suitable gun nearby, ensuring that the empire could not replicate the Freedom Corps' gun tactics of the year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detecting the enchantment magic cover on the lens of his telescope, the double-star castle looks like it is surrounded by light red translucent smoke. The fog of the alert magic circled and disappeared into the sky. Resist the door to close the telescope, open the magic identification manual, and compare the spell description inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Light red, page 15. A wide range of light red stretches the mist, when any formation or medium with more than medium magic enters the mist When you observe the crystal specified by the wizard, you will get the news." He closed the manual and told his companions, "The defense is tight and there is no loophole."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s so beautiful, it’s like an art...well, like a matcha cake with chocolate stars.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a logistics officer, Anne; Unconsciously published a sigh that has nothing to do with the results of the reconnaissance. She sat sideways on a plain broom, gently swaying her legs and floating in the air close to the door. Today, she did not wear the red military uniform, and put on a set of "small clothes" that were also eye-catching - a light blue short skirt suit with a pointed cap and a black velvet cloak. If she is still hunting the magician's barbaric era, her dress will definitely be sent to the stake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door shook his head and took all sorts of strange associations out of his mind and then seriously said: "Matcha cake? Matcha is a rare "Artwork?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh... it seems, about not." Anne realized that she had said an outdated joke and hurried back to the topic. "So, the operation of the Fortress of Stillburg is still very normal. It's a bit strange, isn't it? The Twelfth Division has been playing hot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Is it treason, waiting for the price, or being coerced..." Nana tried to think about his chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that only by going to the center of the overlapping stars can you see what happened." Anne adjusted the balance of the broom and made a Hand pointing to Stilburg. "Would you like to check it out? Now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our mission is to take a reconnaissance and not venture into the scope of the detection magic... forget it. Go to the north Go, okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used the tone of negotiation. Annie thought about it with her head in her head, and some reluctantly nodded. "In fact, you don't have to be so polite. You are a superior, I will follow your decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What superior is no longer the same department. We I have known it for a long time, isn’t it?” Naimen sighed and smiled and spread his hands. "For me, you are a friend, not a subordinate. Don't use such a formal tone, please...you are the last person here to know me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Hearing his pleading tone, Annie looked red, bowed his head and quickly avoided his gaze. She pressed the low broom and the magical vehicle re-launched and swooped down the outside of the forest. She has never used the magic to detect enchantment, but she does not know the light red smoke range to avoid the curved boundary of detecting magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie! Wait for me! You know I only have jump boots!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I bet the Central Army only assigned us a flying broom and jumping boots to be a conspiracy to destroy obsolete goods. The guy who purchased the brooms must have problems..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; When he began to feel tired, the Oslo finally appeared in front of him. It is the widest river on the Great Plains of Koman, and it is impossible to cross without a ship. Resist the door to stop at the water's edge, looking around, the unusually thick bushes across the river caught his attention. He leaped gently, and by the power of the jumping boots reached the mid-sky of tens of meters from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...feather fall!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the highest point is reached The door has changed the air resistance it has received so that it can be observed slowly. In the vision of the magic telescope, the most dazzling is the "big detection network" across the Oslo River. This striking border line hampers communication between the South and the North, and the Empire uses it to control people who enter and leave the country illegally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, forget that this thing exists." The door closed the detection magic, and the real scene appeared at the end of the telescope. "That is... Port?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behind the dense bushes and water plants is a secret military port. Gray and black military uniforms shuttled between the rudimentary piers, with blue uniforms from several Republican officers. Dozens of knights wearing large cloaks form a large circle around the port, seemingly alerting. These knights have colorful cloaks, but each cloak is embroidered with a special bold coat of arms: purple enamel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it true that Steelburg is really an enemy? It’s less than twenty kilometers from the fortress... well? What is that?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked through the telescope to observe the middle of the big circle, and there was a few drops of cold sweat behind it. He found the object of the other party's alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue-eyed witch in the eye of the circle is rushing to the center of the circle. She is still sitting on the broom and trying to defend her opponent’s magic with her hands. Non-magic attack. What stopped her was a tall but not burly red robe knight, with long white hair like a woman. It is difficult to see the magic used by both sides of the battle at this distance, but it can be seen that the red robe people use the magical technique, and the silver light that is emitted is almost a circle, which is obviously taking the upper hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good-looking. Have I seen him anywhere?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;justified When I went to the rescue, the blue petite figure suddenly changed her posture from sitting to riding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clasped her broomstick with both hands, and the whole body leaned forward on the broom, like a shell that was ready to go. The red robe priest tried to block before flying, but was kicked on the forehead by Anne's knees and turned backwards. As soon as she got the acceleration she needed, she rushed out of the encirclement. The knights around were exclaimed, but they could only look at the blue-blue figure across the river and provoke a red alert on the big detection network. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go! I got the configuration map of the emperor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, What the hell are you doing?!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waiting for the door to react, Anne has hooked his neck and left it in the back seat of the broom On, immediately lifted the height. The speed of the broom's escape was much faster than that seen before the door, and the sudden rise made him almost fall. He couldn't care for his self-respect and grace, and he held Annie's waist tightly, for fear of falling on the ground. Fortunately, Anne did not protest anything about his actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I went to their camp and took the military configuration map. It seems that Pickett is not at ease to let the emperor of the brigade be near him, the emperor I don't trust him either. What I didn't expect was that they would send the famous Sisters of the Sables to come here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the calm narrative of Anne, the broom Suddenly made an abrupt three hundred and sixty degree roll, and the door was biting his tongue to prevent himself from making a sound. With the silver chain of the blade chasing, just smashed through the line they just flew. Annie lowered the broom head and made a near-vertical dive, avoiding the backlash of the chain. Her pointed hat had long been blown away, and a short sweep on the face of the door, itchy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out to be an infinite chain of lengths. It's a magical weapon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Behind them, Ionet; Hartman retracted his chain-like "covenant arbiter" and muttered to himself: "A familiar face, always feel where I have seen it. But why not think about it? Get up...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, the commander of the Fourth Army is still waiting for us. Don't waste time here." The adjutant promptly reminded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay. First inform the commander to change the deployment." Inheriting Jeter; the new cardinal in Newton’s position to take up the weapon, "Recipient from the South They are finally here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the configuration map of the emperor. Fifty kilometers northwest is their striker, more than two regiments, belonging to the new Fort Fourth Group Army. The Purple Sisters, also known as the 'Women's Knights', are also nearby, and their magical power is more than five times that of ours."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information that Anne brought back made everyone frown. Other mages who used summoned magical investigations also reported that the first division in the fortress had been mobilized frequently, but did not mean to move at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think it is very dangerous to travel to Steelburg, we should avoid them and find another way. For example, to reinforce the 12th Division of Ebola "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are we not tried yesterday? The 12th Division Command has no Master who can communicate remotely, and it is likely to have been devastated. The attack. Use the existing forces to attack the empire's heavy forces and ease the pressure on the front lines of the West to achieve the greatest results."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We should attack! Attacking Fort Stilt Or simply attack the fourth army left by the empire! How can we win the enemy by relying on defense? Let us let them be a blessing on the land of Ruhrock?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem is logistics! There is no logistics provided by Steelburg, what attack? With the number of our current casters and artillery, we can't break the defense here. If you think you can solve the logistics problem, then Let's solve it, I won't accompany you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ega; Eugen smoked cigarettes and stared eagerly at the members of the staff who expressed their opinions. He has served in the colonial army, the tenth division and the former sixth division, but has not seen such a messy staff meeting. In this staff department, there are three different military uniforms, and the military rank has no corresponding relationship with the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red uniforms were the staff and commanders who were seconded from the second division. They also brought together a regiment of cavalry and a regiment of infantry. Wearing the sky-blue military uniform is the remnant of the original Matterby's division, and they added two infantry regiments that were left behind in Kengal. The number of gray-blue military uniforms is the highest, and the infantry regiment of the original warrior, the newly recruited militia groups of the two Federalists are wearing this military uniform. In purely military power, this division has a large force of more than 12,000 people in a full group; but if it is organized or combative, it is absolutely unreliable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before sending someone to talk to Steelburg, General Pickett may still be in the heart of the Federation."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? So who is willing to take on this task, is it you, Major Machiavelli?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course no problem... Ah, I think we former politicians can go and persuade together. As long as the combat staff can allocate enough deterrents, we can persuade Pict."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "That, it is very difficult now. So many troops have made three assaults..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eagan annihilated the cigarette, replaced it with a pipe, Still silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To send more scouts, the caster should try to focus on reconnaissance, including the staff present here."<br /><br />&nbsp "I disagree. The top priority now is to ensure that we have the ability to defend, and should be dispersed to the various units to ensure basic combat. The operational staff is now not satisfied with the assaults, right?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well. Almost all eunuchs now serve as combat mage, but they are still dissatisfied with the preparation. In the battle at the end of March, the loss rate of officers is even higher than that of soldiers. The Intrepid Mission is okay, and several other groups are really not optimistic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The limited magical power should be displayed in front of the other side. Now the supply line behind us is also very fragile. The enemy may cut off the Royal Mile from the west or the east at any time... One day can't convince Steelburg, we don't have a safe day. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another noisy moment, the generals took out a metal box filled with cigars. The three military uniforms have completely different ideas and it is too late to reach an operational plan. It is simply impossible to imagine that these people can work together to achieve extraordinary success. The greatest contribution they can make seems to be to let the Imperial Staff adjust more troops to guard them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Trouble the attack on Steelburg..." "The Twelfth Division of Reinforcement..." "Truncate the supply of the other party..." "Send a diplomatic envoy..." "Wait for the supply of magical items..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commanding warrior infantry regiment is a young and outrageous lieutenant. It is the Liberal Party and the Federal Party politician who commanded the two militia groups. They relied on mobilization and logistical capabilities to get them the rank of school administrator. The Interlakes are daring to hold on to the offensive dogma, and his own old ministry is always thinking about withdrawing from the main battlefield. The operational staff, the intelligence staff, and the logistics staff are all part-time, and most of them have insufficient military ranks, and there are even cases where the female lieutenant directly manages one department. If there is no dispute over the battle plan, there will be seventeen plans for the 12-day light plan. Originally wanted to break up the troops to improve the combat effectiveness of the militia division, but it was opposed by all the standing army commanders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eugen annihilated the cigar, took out the gum for clearing the mouth, and threw it into his mouth. Everything went fine: he didn't know what the enemy's staff meeting was like, but he knew it was definitely not the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The plans and suggestions that you have put forward are very constructive and it is really difficult to decide. But in any case, the task is still to be implemented. Therefore, the final The order is as follows -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general coughed twice and stood up with a careless smile on his face - when his anger reached a critical point This will reveal this expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Fifth Intercontinental Group, strengthen the defense on the spot, you are the guest army, do not adapt to the weather and terrain here. The first Intress cavalry regiment, Investigate the situation on the east side and strive to get in touch with the Twelfth Division as soon as possible. The fourth and seventh Matterby regiments pretend to supervise the government forces and harass the heavy forces of the emperor. The second, third and sixth Ruhrlocks The staff of the staff dispatched staff and organized a mission to escort Lord Machiavelli and Lord Luther to Stilburg to persuade. Above, who has any questions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A silence. The officers whispered their whispers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing wrong with this guy. Can this be considered a name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Hey, he changed the task of the Interre Army and the Julesian Army. Although it is reasonable, I am afraid it will not receive any effect..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Europe The root did not pay attention to the whispers of the following people, picked up the full ashtray and poured it into the paper basket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today has just begun, take the time to complete their tasks! Meet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All People hurriedly rushed out of the camp and went to organize their teams. Only the head of the logistics department with the lowest military rank scratched his head and asked the people on the left and right sides: "I said, is the Major General angry? Can he hear our whispers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The young lieutenant sitting on her left was a bitter smile, and the head of the major militia, who was sitting on her right and dressed as a man, gave her a look. The two sighed at the same time and replied: "nonsense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone’s head is hurting. The situation seems to be even worse than half a month ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving the order, the soldiers began to form a team that negotiated with Steelburg. All the officers who can use the magic of the entire division are gathered to ensure that all the negotiating people can return safely. The commander of this escort, of course, fell to the head of the operational staff. His ability is above the horizontal line, and he is still in harmony with the soldiers. His personal resume has scratched his head. With the achievements in the three battles of Lenny, Fort Fort, and Kengal, or betrayal, this person has already reached the rank of lieutenant when his peers are still a military school or a non-commissioned officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the door; Soleden’s life guidelines are no guidelines. To put it bluntly, he is a realist who lacks ambition; to say that he is an unscrupulous and unpredictable guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It took three hours to deliberately wait until lunch time... This guy is going to give us a horse." Naniman shook his head and ordered the team to prepare for the opening, and he told the distinguished negotiators. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The negotiator is the name of the lieutenant colonel, the name of the three-year-old child has heard Nikola; Machiavelli. There are two deputy ambassadors, one is Kenlor, the chief priest of the division, and the other is the rookie politician Bruto; Luther, these two are enough to represent the secular and Religious power. These dignitaries were all sitting in the same protective carriage and secretly discussing how they could convince General Pickett to station them in Steelburg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was greeted by Anne, who was in charge of guarding the carriage, knocking on the door of the carriage, waiting for a moment to open the curtain and honoring the military ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Steelburg agrees to let us in, do we leave now, or wait until after lunch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The three people in the car looked at each other, Machiavelli and Nimora used the corner of the eye to look at the youngest Luther. After the handsome young man nodded, Nikolay said: "Now, it's better to start. The sooner this thing is settled, the better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand. "Resistance turned his head and shouted at the other side of the carriage. "It's time to go, Anne."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was a smile, no stop, dial The horse rushed to the front of the team. Anne; Sefer stood on the other side of the carriage and looked at his back and sighed: "He has found out who is the real decision maker here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Bonnie, who appeared as "Luse", thoughtfully replied: "He is obviously a smart person. After all, confidentiality does not make sense for the current situation. I must control this army." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Lord Luther." Anne looked at the fortress like the black spot on the Oslo River. "Now, let us go to steel." Let's go into the fort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town of Steele is a town that has prospered by supplying fortresses, from here to the fortress is less than three kilometers. A century ago, there was a historic city with a record dating back to the Elven Empire, but it was burned out in the first free war. Forty years ago, the empire once again established a stronghold, and this place was re-established with human smoke. After the Federal Republic conquered and seized the fortress as the backbone of the northern defense system, the town became more prosperous, and it was faintly visible. Style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning of the town, you can feel the pressure of the military. The pressure is not from the patrol or the cordon, but from the magical fluctuations around. On the roadside sign, use the Coyman and Elvish words to write a striking "magic out of control zone, please remove all magic effects, do not use spells" warning. All the protective carriages in the team have lifted the magic effect, and the magicians have also put away the equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magic item is fine as long as it is not activated. Seeing this warning, I really want to use a magic to see..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Annie’s self-talk, the doorman hurriedly dissuaded. "Don't. What happens, but I don't know at all. Illumination will turn into a fireball, and blessing will become a famous curse. God's grace may open the crack in the plane... here is the freedom established by the Empire with secret technology. The magic zone is designed to prevent others from using magic to capture this bunker."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I certainly know. So, in the last war, you can use artillery to forcibly break through here. But despite the full anti-magic measures, it can't resist the attack of pure chemical energy. This kind of thing in the out of control area is too dangerous, and one accident will hurt the innocent. In case the ignorant caster is close to it. "What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There should be no more. There are not many casters, and it is not the military or the agent who will be close to here. The problem should be small. "Nanmen thought after thinking about it, "Of course, out of curiosity is not counted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if every ordinary person can be like you in the future Learn magic?" Anne pointed out bloody “One day, we will have to carefully remove all the out-of-control zones around the world, which is far more difficult than setting them up.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Everyone can learn magic? This day is too far away, not something we should be worried about. Sometimes you are really out of touch, Anne." Residents pointed to the distant setting of the banner to transfer the topic "Look, it’s our liaison officer and Pickett."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's so beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, she relaxed her horse and was shocked by the beauty of her eyes. That is Steelburg, a beautiful building called "steel diamonds." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She only saw this fortress that was blown up by the Coman Army in 1873 in black and white photos. In the era when she grew up, the fortress was entwined by the over-expanded urban area and the complex firepower net. The beautiful armor was covered behind the camouflage layer and the concrete wall, just like the beauty trapped in the thorns, there is no beauty. Words. In 1666, Steelburg was like a young woman who was in the most beautiful time of her life. The roughship of the girlhood did not eclipse her, but made her a social flower that made all the soldiers dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spring midday sun is projected vertically on the multiple bullet-proof sloping faces of the Outer Fort, which are dazzling and indescribable. The giant armor made of metal is protected by rust-proof magic, covering the outside of the cement, designed to allow most of the shells to attack the angle of bounce or failure. At this distance, the steel fort looks really like a giant star-shaped diamond, set in the verdant central plain of Coman. Even the surrounding trenches and the blastholes and dark gun holes that are dotted on the diamonds can't hide its brilliance. There are no cities, no houses, no ugly lines of defense, only Steelburg. In this era of war art is still "pure", she is invincible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute." The voice of the door knocked her back to reality. "Why are these 12th Division fighters waiting here?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General Pickett is very busy, he has no time to receive all the visitors, so it will meet you together. You also know that the North is just around the corner. Let Mr. Machiavelli come out soon.” The unspeakable one is Colonel Jules, who is full of bearded faces, and completely disregards the fact that the Emperor has been free to move south of the Oslo River. Even if you are patient and patient, you can’t help feeling very uncomfortable when you see this attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With all due respect, our negotiators are the dignitaries of Kengal. Leave the carriage with adequate protection, in case something goes wrong, you are negative Can you afford the responsibility? If you are not sincere, we can talk again in the next day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sincerity? The colonel who is the deputy commander of the Guards has personally come out to meet, Isn’t it sincerity?” The bearded man grinned disdainfully. “A little lieutenant, dare to talk to me about conditions?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pickert’s intention It is clear that the squad of the colonel class is used to oppress the current military school Machiavelli's military ceremonies - the fact that Naomi is clear, but can only hold back the anger in his heart and not let himself say this. His military rank and identity can't afford the responsibility of breaking the negotiations. The twelfth division was defeated. If the first division surrendered to the empire, the war would be almost impossible to save. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, don't be so excited, let's get acquainted?" Anne, who just jumped off the saddle, squeezed in at the right time, blinking at the colonel, right hand Between the fingers is a piece of tissue covered with the emblem of the Crosso Brothers Bank "see the ticket to pay". The gender of the other party and such a public bribery made the colonel hesitate, but in the end he took over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Seeing the amount above, the beard frowned and smashed it into a ball, eager to lose, but suddenly remembered What seems to be stunned. In the end, he still stuffed the paper into the pocket of the military coat, and the voice was low: "The carriage is not incomprehensible. After all, safety is the first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;His subordinates are all a glimpse, and an eunuch immediately wants to speak. Annie hurriedly rushed forward and took out a lot of golden pounds in her hands: "Everyone came out to meet and worked hard, just get some allowance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soldiers Although there are some mistakes, but the chiefs have taken it, and I am embarrassed not to take it. In the end, everyone has more allowances for their monthly salary. Looking at the door and looking at the bribe that was almost equivalent to his salary a year, couldn't help but swallow. After the money was divided, the arrogance of these soldiers was significantly lower, and they began to lead the way with peace of mind, with the negotiating team through the heavily guarded main entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 12th division officers and men wearing green uniforms can only watch their performances reluctantly, and the head of the major is even more disdainful. Resist the door to pay attention to his look, called several assaults and even soldiers came over, let them free the Malay to lend to the friendly forces without mounts. His friendly behavior only exchanged the thank-you and self-introduction of the sinister major. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you. Jacques; Pierre, Oswego's combat staff. I can't understand why you are bribing this kind of person."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if you have money, is it necessary to spend this? These ordinary soldiers can't influence Pict's decision..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who said?" Annie suddenly inserted Into his complaint, "The two hundred pounds, but a very important pathfinder before the negotiations. From this we can at least know two important things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Ah..." Resist the door and smile, "Pathfinder?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First, there is now a deficiencies in Steelburg, and The Republic’s division has always been known as a soldier, but now every soldier is willing to give up the principle for the gold coin, which shows that the owe is already serious. Second, at least in the high-ranking officers, the view of relying on the empire is not popular. The colonel was already one of the best senior officers in the fortress, but he accepted a banknote with only one hundred pounds denomination and issued by the Southern Bank. It is obvious that he is counting on the future to cash the banknote. That is, Negotiations by economic means should be feasible."< Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, Anne will show her sharp-knive analysis and processing skills, and that a little confused smile is just her daily side...maybe a mask? Thinking of this, Nana did not want to go deeper and changed the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should we do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are here, only one There is no shortage of things: money. Almost all of the assets of the former Kengal government are in our hands.” Annie raised her finger. “We don’t just want to buy up the nobles, but also buy the soldiers at the bottom. Tilburg, we have a strong support point, no longer there will be a car food transported from the center to the emperor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the words, she happened to pass under the motto of the main entrance of the fortress. The door was raised and stared at the word above. The line of words is "defense is a strong shield, attack is a sharp edge": the heroic empire designer wrote this line, the designers of the Republic not only did not paint it, but also re-edited this line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Fourth Army really just wants to transport it from here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie The fingers calculated: "They can't overcome this. According to the deployment document, the Fourth Army has a maximum of 30,000 troops."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We only have one Ten thousand people..." The door was a bitter smile, no longer talking, and the surrounding environment no longer allowed him to chat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spires surrounding the imperial atmosphere tell them: the inner fort is here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage stopped in front of the Central Commander’s Tower. Three representatives and Jacques representing the 12th Division walked off the train in turn, and the aides of Nanimen, Anne and Jacques followed. Behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it’s been received, no one is honouring them, but some guards are seeing Nimola’s silver-clad white robe on behalf of the bishop Teaching was done. Pico's specific conditions are also quite demanding: there are only three guards, and the weapon can only have a pistol. Bishop Nimora and Major Jacques wanted to protest, but they were stopped by Bonnie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Three is enough, killing us is not good for him. In fact, we have two guards." Bonnie pulled out his own emblem. Put it on the table next to it, "If you ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sergeant in charge of checking the equipment glanced at the holy emblem, was taken aback, busy Hand in hand: "No, no need. Please put away your holy emblem, Mr. Luther, and also Nimora. We don't dare to collect the bishop's emblem, as long as several guards take the pistol out and check it. Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, the sergeant turned his head - and stared at the things that Nana and Annie had come up with. "Pistol... Does your sixth division send this kind of thing as a pistol?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black all-metal revolver and aluminum that looks like a silver block The alloy pistol was glaring on the table, and the guns were still engraved with a mess of spells. Nanimen and Annie smiled slyly, thinking about what reason to look for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny grabbed her "killer" and explained the following: "This magic gun is insured, as long as it is not open." It doesn't matter..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, anyway, the magic guns are all things that can't be used. Take it back." The sergeant will handle the two guns. One push, waved and let go, the two talents finally breathed a sigh of relief. However, the troubles that Pickett deliberately made are far from over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please enter the seat according to the famous brand, everyone." A major sitting opposite the direction of the commander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nikolay finally couldn’t help it, grabbed all the famous brands one by one, sat down in the middle of the main position, glaring at the opposite side Lieutenant General said in a word: "I believe that our messenger has already handed over the list of delegates to you. If you have not negotiated sincerity, please let me know. Don't engage in these little tricks!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Negotiation? Who said that we have to negotiate? I just came out of the obligation of the friendly army to receive these representatives, don't make a mistake." With two mustaches Lieutenant General Kate sneered. "Do you want to enter Stilburg? Sorry, this is the responsibility of the republic's division, not yours. 'The king's division will go to defend the southern king river?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the tension, Luther hurriedly pulled Nikola’s sleeves and whispered: “Calm, calm, don’t go to him.” He turned to Pickett again. The general, posing in a very low posture, one by one to cope with each other's pride. Upon receiving the reminder, Machiavelli also calmed down and waved to let everyone sit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the other party is ready to empty the position of Major General Eugen, Nana has to sit next to Jacques to fill the table. Anne stood on his side and watched the talk with Jacques' adjutant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will explain our position first. Steelburg can provide a certain amount of supplies to the Sixth Division, but definitely can not enter the fortress, this is us The bottom line. Before the Imperial Fourth Army, the two divisions can use the town of Steele as the base containment unit.” The chief staff of the first division first took out the plan and placed it on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With the unmasked town of Steele as the base, attacking the Fourth Army of the Empire with 30,000 troops?! Just kidding!" Outrageous conditions, Major Jacques took the table directly. "Do you still have a trace of self-esteem to defend your country?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In terms of compilation, sixth and The 12th Division should have 28,000 troops, and the Fourth Army is evenly matched. Why can't it attack, Jacques; Major Pierre? How many people have you lost in Ebola?" I completely ignore the shame and anger of the Twelfth Division. They are deliberately to sprinkle salt on the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...eight thousand people." Listening to Pickett mentioning this thing, Jacques’ body is obviously shorter, and after spitting out a number, he will not swear. Words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you are accepting. So, everyone in the Sixth Division? As long as you agree, we can start organizing your supply from now on. The enemy has crossed Gistov, and the supply line from Kengler is at stake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing each other’s well-being, has been retreating Bonnie and the mediation smiled and finally opened up as Bruto; Luther. "General General, are you mistaken? Our mission is not to face the Fourth Army. We are here to reinforce you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reinforcement We don't need reinforcements! Steelburg is unbreakable!" The guard of the fortress guard on the side shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What we bring is not just reinforcements." Bonnie sneaked out a picture issued by Bruto; Luther on behalf of the new government of Kengal Check and gently put it on the table. "As far as I know, the people in the town of Steele have reached the limit of their endurance. This is a three-month military."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp That piece of paper is much heavier than its actual weight. The officers on the opposite side almost stood up, and all the guards’ eyes were firmly nailed to the check, and it was like a fire coming out. The last time there was a military sent to Kengal, it was already in December last year - that was Pict's perennial wait-and-see attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if you don't, you can't enter the fortress. We are not very anxious about the military. After all, even if we don't have money, we must swear to guard." Tilburg." Pickett swallowed and continued to insist on his own conditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guarding here? If we lose to the Fourth Army, Kengler will become a lonely city, and the Emperor will not care about it. If he lays down Lenny Here, you will lose all value." Bonnie bite the word "value" and hits it in the depths of Pict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's discuss it." Lieutenant wiped the sweat, stood up, and walked to the window with a few confidants. They seem to be divided into two factions, whispering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
