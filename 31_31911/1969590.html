			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xv<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom Major Major Hull; Tedwood will be 24 years old this year. He graduated with a third place in the school three years ago and became the fastest-moving person among his peers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He served as an adjutant in the most elite army of the entire Freedom Army and was fortunate to be the head of one of the top 10 intelligence networks in the South. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his twenty-four years of life, there are many memorable days - but the most memorable one is this day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods bless freedom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 7 pm on December 7, 1665, He stood in the middle of the parliamentary hall and accepted the flowers and praises of the parliamentarians who represented the people of the province. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us cheer for the defenders of freedom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 7, 1665 At 7 pm, he saved the Joint Parliament and the Republican Government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live the hero of the Save the Union!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the evening of December 7, 1665, 7 Point, he saved his motherland. As a soldier, there is no more glorious moment than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone, please calm down a little." Hull pressed his excitement in his heart. "The battle is not over yet, the enemy has not been completely defeated, the coup plan The person has not yet been arrested. Before the end of the coup, please allow me to use this as a temporary command."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Naturally, no one will object to this reasonable Proposal. "No problem, general! Go ahead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I am only a major, not..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you will one day become a general, young man." The older member patted him on the shoulder again. "You will become a general."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hold, sorry, I want to go out and supervise the progress of the battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major was made up by the acclaimed politicians here. Dizziness; taking the attention to the situation as an excuse, he apologetically apologized and withdrew from the Chamber of Deputies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not your credit... you are just an executor. Sober, Hull; Tedwood! These plans and promotions are all You have nothing to do with General Lopez’s direct deployment!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shouted in his heart. Standing on the top of the seventy-two steps, letting his figure shine in the splendid fire of the parliament building, listening to the rumble of guns in the distance, feeling the cold wind behind, Hull felt that he seemed to be awake. Still can't be dazzled by joy, the battle is not over yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, now the troops have been chased into chasing, everything is going well." Seeing him coming out of the parliament building, the long-awaited intelligence officers rushed forward to return the battle . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everything is carried out according to the plan, and the loss should be kept to a minimum." He looked at the map and calmly mobilized the troops. "If you rush to the east, If you let the three central companies speed up, they must stop the other party from plundering and setting fire. The two companies in the North District sent people to scout and fight for the encirclement of the generals and annihilate all the defeats in the North..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, being called a general is really a good feeling; calmly mobilizing troops on the edge of death is indeed a very good feeling, Hull thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wish I could see her as a "save hero to save freedom"... although it should not be enough to be called a goal worthy of penetration by extraordinary means. 'But it seems to be handsome too?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-When he thought so, he suddenly saw a fascinating light blue hair The figure floated on the "72 steps leading to freedom." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, he even thought it was the illusion of his own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, good night, Lord Major." Bonnie, who appeared as "female and half-vampire Bardez; only"; Sephiel grabbed his head and smiled and replied. - Smile is to cover up the impolite fact that she could not remember his name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That, what are you doing here? Are we sure we have regained the parliament building?" It’s a top female spy, the intelligence is really sensitive... Hull is The heart is so sloppy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not exactly." Bonnie showed a charming smile, "There is more important work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her head and gestured to Katzmi to catch up with his people; more than twenty fierce savage followers immediately rushed to the steps - no one knows how they broke through the surrounding net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, this..." The guards were surprised to ask Hull’s opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let’s wait and see." I don’t know why, the major didn’t want to stop this woman’s action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a warm atmosphere in the main hall of the parliament building. Members of the parliament have come up with wines that they don’t know where they are coming from, and are celebrating victory; however, an out of date The voice interrupted this grand celebration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone can stand! Don't move, stay in your own position! Rebel or don't listen to the commander, kill innocent!" The woman's voice is clear Loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of Members cast their gaze on the door, and almost no one acted in accordance with that order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a joke?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Women...? This Yuxing show is good, who Called?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing no one to pay attention to her, Bonnie sneered in the corner of her mouth and hurried to the rostrum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Self-introduction, I am a vampire killer, Bartholomew; only. The purpose of my visit here is to achieve justice."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jade finger of her right hand was gently shot in the air, and a gorgeous sterling silver pistol appeared in her palm. The all-sealed structure has amazing destructive power and is capable of penetrating almost all magical enchantments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just borrowed." She whispered softly, her hand slammed, did not aim, and immediately pulled the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"砰". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisp gunshot immediately overwhelmed everything, and everyone’s smile solidified on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the most upright, often the most irritating of the motivation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bullets with powerful powers fly and go straight to the chairman of the National Justice Party. The face of the sensible parliamentarian changed dramatically. He subconsciously reached out and ejected a blood shield from his fingertips, trying to block the bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be the most honest and reliable, often the deepest..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bullets Accurately hit the blood shield, a slight stagnation - and then hesitated without hesitation. The devil's array of the six-pointed star flashed slightly - flashing the proud achievements of the future generations of science and technology for two hundred and fifty years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The most vocal words of praise are often the darkest of thought..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The bullet rotates, rotates, and strikes the heart of the councilman, like a stake that can nail him. Members of the lofty status and representing the rights of 15,000 Southern citizens screamed and turned into white ash, which was blown away in the air by a hurricane. The vampire elders who were able to resiliate in the light of the sun and who had achieved the glory of the sun were quietly turned into ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dust to dust, soil to earth. It is always wrong to take people from outside and identity."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie blows away the smoke of the muzzle and re-scans the audience with a savvy and glamorous look. No one even laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took out a small box from her arms and opened it. It was filled with a small holy water. "Please accept the test one by one. It is a price to pay for the endless life and the scum of dignity and personality." It’s time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her; Tedwood’s eyes squinted and looked at the incredible things in front of him. He felt that everything he knew, defended, and believed was collapsing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old MP who once photographed his shoulder and encouraged him, went crazy and smashed the sword to kill him, and then was surrounded by Bardot. The fierce guards cut a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member who was still clinking with Tong Xiao’s face was actually holding his companion as a shield – but he still could not escape the pursuit of bullets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heroine of this play throws the box at hand into the air, letting the box burst into pieces with her gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holy water in the box is turned into numerous bundles of water, from which they are rushed in and out in the air; the splashes of water are suspended in the air, in the light Under the reflection, it is like a little bit of stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holy rain that brings over and rest. Looking at the members who were stunned by the holy water and still mad, Hull felt sick. He resolutely took out the sword and joined the battle group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did I save? Save the servants of the people, or the servants of the vampires?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; At 7:30 pm on December 7, 1665, Hull understood that he could not save anything. The dream of becoming a hero lasted for half an hour and turned into a painful reality. Hull didn't know what his face was like, maybe it would be called "cry and laugh." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour and a half later than the history, the United Parliament was forced to disband due to more than one-twentieth of the total number of dead members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know where the clouds are floating from the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sporadic fires ignited in turn, reflecting on the clouds, showing a faint crimson, which seemed like the sunset was still in the free city. The cruel beauty created by violence, but unfortunately there is no white pigeon to accompany. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main force of the defending army has completely collapsed, and the squad has begun to plunder and plunder the city. In order to reduce maintenance costs, a large part of the defending armies of the free nations are mercenaries; like most governments, the local government of Lenny also defaults on the wages of these mercenaries, and now they are getting their own rewards in their own way. ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Take out the money and valuables, or kill you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cry is one after another. After quickly gaining the predation in various ways, professional mercenaries from all over the world did not hesitate to kill witnesses. They lit the fire and tried to stop the pursuit of the soldiers with flames. Wooden houses, in the dry winter, can easily burn one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let's go to the fire and hurry to the east gate to retreat! Go to the next street within three minutes, don't worry about it!" The mercenary officers were deaf to the cry of the civilians and skillfully commanded the looting and killing. "The one over there, still carrying a woman? You really have a leisurely feeling, thinking that you can escape with a woman?! Kill... No, let it go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Women? I don't have it, who brought it?" The mercenary who was named was twisted his head in a strange way, and his eyes could no longer move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attracting all men’s eyes is a beautiful girl with a bright smile. The charm she radiated made even the sergeant feel difficult to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I came by myself. Only in a few places burned up, it’s really tired to hurry." Anne; Seifer holds in her hand The map, looked at it, and smiled and said: "Come, stop here, you should not continue to do evil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight, she deliberately wore The tight-fitting leather armor that gives the perfect body, and the light makeup; the little magic that attracts the opposite sex makes her sexy charm more eye-catching. It looks completely like 16 years old, but like 20 years old. Under the blazing fire of the surrounding buildings, her shawl blonde hair is a dazzling golden red. It is not so much a heroine who wants to save the world, but rather a female high school student who is going to date. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because... you will all be captive here." Annie chuckled, his left hand pulling a bundle of unremarkable hemp rope from his waist pocket and throwing it underground. "Activate! Free ropes, bundle all the enemies in front of you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This command was executed very faithfully by those magic ropes. The magic ropes entangled quickly, and all the mercenaries who had just participated in the plunder were bundled. Anne did not pay more attention to the mercenaries who were destined to become captives, speeded up their steps and ran towards the burning houses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is it... Where is it? That person, is it not in the city? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning flame, only touched the breeze of the fire-extinguishing magic that overflowed at her fingertips, and it was completely extinguished. Annie quickly ran between the burning houses, and one after another fire was extinguished in her hands, and a bottle of therapeutic potion emanated from her magic bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, thank you! How can we thank this life-saving grace? Please leave your name, we will do our best to repay you..." People, thank you grandly and sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, don't repay, call me the savior. By the way, is there a cool and handsome handsome boy in your family?" For everyone, Anne has asked questions that have been prepared for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, most of the time, she can only get a regrettable answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally there are several who will claim that "the dog is cool and handsome", but the result is very disappointing for the girl: most of the height is only enough for her nose. "The pure and beautiful young boy", or the height is good, but his face is white and thin, "good and beautiful young boy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The diet structure and aesthetics of the Age of Enlightenment is really a problem. Is it time to introduce new crops?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young girl from the later generation complained while watching the twilight under the clouds in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be on fire again? That direction is near the Cathedral of Fatila? It’s so far, I hope to catch up..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it has been hit hard, the savior full of self-confidence, triumph and sense of justice is still trying to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She runs from east to west, looking for love, dreams and hopes, without stopping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After putting on a black cloak that is easy to hide, the ordinary teenager looks out of the hidden alley. Looking around and confirming that there were no soldiers on either side, Soledon came out with peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh... it’s despicable." He took a few steps forward and stopped to sigh in front of a shop that had been burned to white. The reason why he stopped here was because he noticed that a chopped gentleman was lying on the nearby ground and twitching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Do you need treatment?" the young boy asked friendlyly; when he heard this sentence, the middle-aged gentleman nodded busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton smiled more friendlyly: "Please pay for the treatment. 500 gold coins, check or cash."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentleman is nodded and nodded: "Okay, good! As long as you cure me, you must sign your check!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Thank you for your review. Soledon closed his eyes, concentrated, and began to sing the mantra. "...healing, wound! cure lighds!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wound on the gentleman's arm began to heal. He felt that he had no pain, and he stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton smiled and looked at him: "Please pay. Since you know that I am a mage, what happens if you don't pay?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the teenager touched the purse with satisfaction and continued on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good... It’s a check for 500 gold coins. It’s really good to make a profit this evening... It’s good to not go back temporarily. Thanks to me, I also have a study and treatment system. The magic is not as pedantic as other mages. Today, these money are earned. The people who can be treated on this street have been cured... Where are you going?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
