The two sides have mixed together, the artillery has been unable to function, and several guns near the west side are empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, bring this to Eugen. This thing is good for his retreat. You bring the empire's envoys to join with Eugen, the last two The boat was still parked in the port."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radz Govard looking at it all over the fort on the side of the port shook his head, no hobby, There is no madness, but it is very graceful to hand over the low-light telescope that has been with him for many years, and I’m calmly starting to allocate the evacuation plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis was shocked and took the telescope with a stiff motion, dissuading him: "Hello, I think you will still retreat from the waterway with us. If you No, who is hosting the overall situation in Kengler?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a little lacking." I have experienced dozens of battles in the past. Calmly, "Maybe I shouldn't have... forget it, there is no need to say the scene. You should go quickly. I estimate that Leonard's river fleet will soon come over to join in the fun, and then the water will not go." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the marshal’s expression to accept any ending, Isis didn’t know how to persuade. Fortunately, the Viscount on the side couldn’t hold it anymore, and he opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't walk the water. How can I say that I am also the emperor's envoy, have the right to choose my own retreat route? You just need to give me a few ways to know the road. People are fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Gowal wants to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know what Robert has, and I know what I have; but I don't know your captain and the captain of the other party. Besides, you also need people. Let's lead the enemy and unify the defeated army? As for what you are worried about... rest assured. In the name of my honor, it will not tarnish your reputation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The prince said that he pulled out the sword at the waist, and the golden light spread from the ridge of the sword, reflecting his persevering expression. That is the expression that a true paladin will have. The implicit meaning in his words, everyone understands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goval, who is said to be at the center, breathes a stagnation. "Then I will not ask you why. You can pick someone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you heard the marshal’s words, maybe it was infected by the Cavaliers, and Isis immediately Chest out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then let me go with him, sir. I am familiar with the road here, there is me, at least we can save more of our people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Captain. You go with all the people who are willing to take the land, others are on board. The wounded are preferred."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the final order, the commander-in-chief of the government government sent young people to leave. Now he has become a lot easier, and his brows have been loosened. He found an empty cannon box on the edge of the port, and looked at the port with his naked eyes. The green uniforms of the Fabians are still somewhat indistinguishable at this distance, but they have already heard the sound of guns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't recognize the failure until now, you will be laughed at by the late generations of Betsy and Lopez." Govar looked at the double green signal representing "retreat" Repeatedly across the sky, "But I still have one thing to teach them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is riding a horse that lost the owner, followed by Robert and Thain. They are moving forward together. He struggled to keep a distance from others because his blue uniform on behalf of the "traitor" was so conspicuous in the green ocean. The other surrendered soldiers were left in the square, and he "followed the courage" to follow the gendarmerie captain. Probably for the sake of caution, Robert agreed with the proposal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he just couldn’t face the comrades who cheered and celebrated a few hours ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold wind outside is not slightly reduced, but it feels not so bitter. Robert gave him a precious warm potion like a comrade-in-arms, saving him from the edge of the frozen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lieutenant colonel was at the forefront of all the guerrilla cavalry, and the right hand clung to the inconspicuous sword, and the left hand used protective magic to resist the other's shooting. When all the bayonet and spear are on the inconspicuous sword, they will be broken into two sections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am the gendarmerie captain Sain Constance! Govar has surrendered, Eugen has also withdrawn! You have no hope, surrender!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real traitor is behind Robert. The middle-aged officer will not be magical, but the expression on his face is not confused, and he does not hesitate to attack the colleagues who have just cheered together. The defenders with low morale were disarmed by Robert, or were captured or rebelled by the gendarmerie captains who followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negman has been trying to find Robert's shortcomings, the more he looks for it, the more desperate he is. He does not abuse the captives, nor does he fight the men, the charge is at the forefront, and the retreat is at the end. Even the enemy, he always does not kill directly, but first shoot down their weapons - swearing to be astonishing. The teenager could not imagine how such a person survived his military career; but he knew that the man must be using his power to carry out a certain creed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the double green signal came out, the remaining supervised government forces began to retreat in an orderly manner, and the pressure on the flanks dropped sharply. Finally, on the spearhead of the cavalry's assault, the blue military uniform was no longer visible. In the face of the intricate road system, the team did not know where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to the place where the retreat signal was sent before. Govar has only one mage who can use the ray magic to transmit letters. The other units are split by the company. Said Sean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to this statement without any emotion, the door slowed down the speed of the mount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So soon it has become 'a wizard who can use ray magic', he is really a complete traitor... What am I thinking? Ah. Am I not just a traitor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the memories of more than 20 days still unpredictable in my mind. Busy paperwork, a smashing officer's canteen, a celebration of the Firebird Contest, and a cold lunch that the beauty boss occasionally brings. In this fortress, people agree with his ability and identity as an officer. Now he is just a traitor; even if he returns to Lenny's home, he is just an ordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military is a career that kills people. His dream is ordinary life. But now, the teenager has found that he has gradually...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two more retreats are sent, this time is closer. The cavalry rushed out of the intersection and found it in front of the enemy's main force! More than a thousand soldiers who were evacuated from various blocking points were crowded on the road and retreated toward the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a Frenchman! The spear is broken!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is heard The voice of Itis, this voice has not been calm and calm in the past. He looked forward and saw a big sword with a golden glow, just before the faint iron sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although its special effects should have no effect on the owner of 'justice'...but I still want to give it a try. Let me give it to me after the break. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frasol Rasta is holding a weapon called "Honour", pointing to the "justice" of the opponent's invincible: " Activation starts! Magic suppression starts! Glory crown starts!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leiden felt great uneasiness and subconsciously swayed. Panic-stricken, he couldn’t take a look at the road, slammed into the familiar alley, and turned away from the surveillance of the Faith guards and fled to the south side of the unmanned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind him, the golden glow of honor ran into a bleak sense of justice, bursting with the glare of the arc of death like the new moon. The "Glory Crown" turned into countless hair tracking arrows, but it was easily blown away by the iron bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been half an hour since the capture of the artillery position, whether it’s a retreating ship or a force from both sides. Eugen gradually began to worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Major Cousin, is there any detective magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Use it." "Follow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cousin closed his eyes and the world became black and red. He recited the mantra, his right arm slanted over the fortress, and the colorless detection line shot along the index finger, flashing past the fortress. Gunpowder smoke caused by shelling and gun battles is generally invisible, but it can be detected by this means for detecting magicians. As a member of the Special Operations Department, Peter is good at identifying distances and heights based on small temperature differences. This magic effect lasts only a moment, so it requires a great amount of observation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The current combat line is between the East Gate and the North Gate. The combat intensity is not high. The artillery support is very small, limited to the five fort on the east and north. I The army is retreating..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the ship?" Eugen asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is still a ship in the port. There is no battle at the pier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter opens his eyes and ends The magic effect. Upon hearing these results, Eugen thought for a moment and turned sharply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Put all the enemy's horses! Soldiers who will fight immediately! The artillery units take over the artillery, right north gate!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Cousin stunned. "You have to go in? According to the current situation, people inside should be able to withdraw, and the ship should arrive soon. Since the battle has failed, we don't have to risk investing more people..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it’s already dangerous now. If you don’t leave, there will be big problems in politics.” Eugen took the horse left by a Frenchman. Cross over, wave your arms, "No injured soldiers! Come with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the suspension bridge of the North Gate slowly opens and evacuates The striker of the unit has arrived. When I saw the heavily armed cavalry, the soldiers who were supporting each other were shocked. After seeing the blue military uniform, they finally relaxed and stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't stop here! Pass the class quickly and go to the artillery position and re-team!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The retreating defenders flocked to the north gate along several different roads. The cavalry of the lieutenant colonel squashed everyone and rushed into the fort against the retreating crowd. He ordered the cavalry to be divided into several teams and rushed to the break. They chose the road with the most rescuing numbers and rushed to the enemy's forward with more than 20 elites. Fortunately, although the number of the team is large, it is not too long, and he soon saw the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the team is a large empty field with no people, only bodies and blood. The separation of the Jules and the French people is the golden brilliance of flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eugen sees the radiant sword on the defensive And the sleazy sword is on the offensive. Rasta can only do his best to maintain his "honor" and resist Robert's "justice." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not maintenance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Eugen is a new generation of officers who receive magic education, he also received a considerable level of sword training. He can see that it is now that the sword itself is maintaining the defensive, rather than relying on the sword of the liberation of the knight. The sacred sword that can fight automatically is no less powerful than any first-rate swordsman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The original is the last special effect of 'honor'. 'Honour is something outside the body', is the person who made the sword want to say this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eugen. Since you are here, don't stay and watch the line." Itis calmly sounded, she is using a very long distance. The shot blocked the enemies who wanted to approach from both sides. "After the broken reinforcements arrived, Lord Viscount, withdraw!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment of hearing this sentence, The sword of Frasal Rasta paused. That moment, the outcome of this battle was decided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert's moustache tilted slightly and gave a pitiful smile. In his sword, the sword of an ordinary iron-like sword appeared a dim white light that penetrated the only flaw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And justice lies in the hearts of people, forgotten and trampled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justice rarely appears, so it looks unremarkable--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--but once it Really appear, it is the most powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden sacred sword flew obliquely, hit the wall, and added several defects to fall. Every blade that has been stabbed with that iron strip has a defect, making it look like a ridiculous logging saw, and has lost the power to penetrate the cement. The sword of the town group of the Liberation Knights fell to the ground like this, and no one picked it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Suspend, the secret of the empire?" Robert asked faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I surrender." The illegitimate son of the Holy Emperor, the Royal Security Ministry is currently looking at the humble iron in the second secret secret agent in the South. I sighed and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this change happened so quickly that the soldiers of Eugen had not had time to jump off immediately. As a true staff member, the lieutenant colonel of the government government immediately made a judgment. The horse turned and leaned over and picked up Itis and placed it behind her horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you going to do? Don't you save Rasta?!" Isis's indifferent shell was finally completely stripped. "There will be big problems... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No effort to manage politics! All launched, retreat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Routine chasing, breaking, harassing shooting, closing. The finishing work was done by the artillery captured by Rasta: seeing that the artillery position had been lost, Robert waved and stopped chasing, avoiding the possibility of paying more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Battle of Fort Vatican ended on the suspension bridge of the North Gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government forces invested a total of 10,500 people, the deceased was 603, the wounded were 980, and the captured were 1,600. Sixteen, the remaining strength is 7,262. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French army invested a total of 5,300 people, the dead four hundred and forty, the wounded eight hundred and ninety-one, the captured two thousand seven seven Ten, the remaining strength of 1,899 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Southwest Army has invested a total of 3,200 troops, with zero casualties and zero captives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of death and injury, the defenders who have the advantage of strength have a big victory. Can take 25 percent of the casualty ratio from Robert Ayre enough to make any commander proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as far as politics is concerned... that is another matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, how do you make this happen?" After listening to the final situation, Peter Coulson was unable to sit on the cannon of a cannon. Down, "What are we going to do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, first block the message and retreat north. Now we have half a division at hand. Forces, as long as you return to the friendly area to restore the supply. Or, we can also try to attack with the help of the strength of the force."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear the advice of Itis Eugen also sat down and licked his pocket. The pocket is empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s hard to decide... Peter, is there a cigar in the supply?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then retreat. Be careful, otherwise our people will run out before seeing the friendly."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the remaining government forces gave up trying to save their chiefs because of cigar supply problems. The gunfire finally sank, and the soldiers dragged their heavy steps to re-enter the journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one inconspicuous secret communication magic that flies upstream against the river of the Metebeisi River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The end of the campaign. Govar and Rasta are captured. It is a devastating foreign affairs for my country. Please ask the new head of the Southern Bureau to host the rescue plan. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
