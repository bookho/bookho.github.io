Central District 1<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***-***-***-***-***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenny The central division is not divided between east and west. It has only one shining name, and that is the first district. On top of its decorative wall, there is a battle flag painted with a big sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenmen? When Captain Soledon saw the flag, he ran to find their commander, coming from the acquaintance General Mekash. A company and a pile of magic items and supplies for underground operations. The Seventh National Division is a temporary reserve force that has been temporarily pulled up, but all three companies have participated in the groundwater cleaning operations in the past few weeks, and the experience is relatively rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He brought together the three companies and a company that was even out of the third division where Mr. Zalt’s teacher was located, and assigned tasks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that you will be able to guard the area near the Central Library and the Federal Museum. If there is a change in these two places, you can support it for the first time. This area is scattered with waste. Unused tunnels, although the possibility is very low, but we can not underestimate the ability of the enemy. Each company draws a row, disperses the warnings at the entrances and exits of the library and the museum, and confesses to the librarians, once there is any abnormality - stressed Once again, any abnormalities will be investigated together with the security teams of the two museums."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds very reasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All execution orders. I will obtain permission from the top two museums to investigate the defense of the rare library in the depths of the underground. If you go to the museum, if you find a defense If the magic is destroyed, don't act, let me know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confession turned and walked into the Central Library. In the past, the Duke of Lonnie was in the south of the empire for hundreds of years, and the nobles of the past built a very luxurious mansion here. All the buildings near the central square of Lenni’s first district were once the royal residence of the Duke’s house. The central library is also filled with extravagant reliefs and murals. The flames of the revolution burned the Duke’s mansion, and the burnt wreck became a square of free citizens, leaving only a few annexes to declare the glory of the aristocratic era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his head and stared at the elf-style fantasy paintings on the ceiling, waiting for the librarian to send the keys to the cellar and the highest-permission reading card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very familiar with this building, and his entire teenage years are almost always spent here. Here he and Danica eagerly read, study, study, study science and magic, study history and literature. He and she both believe in their talents and believe that they will one day be able to win scholarships with their own strength. They believe that they can get a license from the Masters Association and become a true association mage, relying on their own strength. Living in this country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his ability, he may not have the opportunity to have his own research room or mage tower, nor will he get the immunity and the seat of the council, but he You should be able to get a VIP card to enter the rare library...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is your VIP card, Captain."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen took the keychain and VIP card from the female librarian and hung the keychain on his armed belt. The reading card in hand is an inconspicuous black, but it symbolizes the right to enter the treasure house. Normally, it takes more than 20 years to get this reading card. Even Zalte Fran has not passed the test. However, today, the door is only awarded with this certificate by his own rank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been here many times, but rarely seen female librarians. The city of Lenny, with a population of only 500,000, has mobilized more than ten divisions to invest in the war, and librarians have also been confiscated. In this era, the real librarians are those who have been deeply educated and learned for many years. Most of them are magicians. It is not easy to deceive these people in order to save knowledge. But it is not difficult to deceive the girls who temporarily replace them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are not real librarians after all... If I can come in, I can do it too."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing in front of the sealed door, he lifted the VIP card and read the language: "I am the VIP of the big library and ordered this door to open for me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No response. He felt that something was wrong. He stepped forward and pushed the door open like a magical protection. The original protection magic had been forcibly dispelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door knocked a finger and held the gun at the waist with his hand: "It seems to be here. Our thoughts look almost the same," ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't rush to the depths, but stopped, his fingers crossed the chest, and began to recite his eyes to identify magic. Mantra. The sixth rare library, the seventh rare library, and the eighth rare library, he recognized the extent to which the defensive magic was destroyed. Although concealed, there are more than one trace of damage on the iron gate. Obviously, the intruder doesn't have enough magic to recover all the defensive magic, and she doesn't need to cover up all the crime scenes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The late rare books were not in use during the first party system. At that time these were just empty cells. Very accurate judgment. Until the thirteenth rare book The defensive magic of the library has been destroyed. According to the usual logic, she only advances to the thirteenth library -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stop before you stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But if it is me, it will destroy the defensive magic of two or three books. So the correct answer is not ten or eleven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped in. The bookshelf is full of precious books, and about half of them are all kinds of magic books. Resist the door to resist the urge to flip through, began to knock the floor piece by piece, pull the books on the bookshelf, press the surrounding magic stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time he is miscalculated. It took him an entire hour to knock the floor and wall panels of the tenth and eleventh stacks one by one, but found no abnormalities. He refused to admit defeat, didn't even eat lunch, spent another three hours, knocked all the floors from the sixth to the thirteenth treasure house, and there was no abnormal echo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is impossible. I have knocked all eight, no response, no secrets. All the reverberation of the floor sounds like other floors. The same..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside guns are getting tighter and closer. He was unable to sit down against the wall and wondered what went wrong. Reneka was originally only two hours ahead of him. It is impossible to have time to set a false target here and then move to another place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It must be here! But, where is the entrance? Where am I worse than her? What is not noticed--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. He reacted violently, and there was a loophole in his reasoning that he did not notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Getting the soil. Large-scale excavation of the soil. They can't dig tunnels from these narrow rare treasures, then the actual tunnel access is - ―”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door quickly ran out of the rare library and walked into the corridor. He slammed the floor of the corridor, and the echo from the floor was the same as the floor echo in the rare library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to facilitate the borrowing, they could not dig the floor under the cells. The excavation started directly from the corridor! Below the corridor, it was the empire. Tunnel! I found this when she drove to the thirteenth library, and I was misled by her, wasting four hours here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistance The door ran to the end of the corridor and used magic to open the floor tiles. Below is a slope made up of mud that extends all the way down and extends deeper than the groundwater. Eighty years of accumulation and cracking made the tunnels look dangerous, but he noticed that someone had turned out the new soil with fresh footprints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell of rancid smell came from the depths, and he took out a bottle of free-breathing potion and drank it. The illuminated crystal rods are attached to the outside of the arm and to the outside of the ankle, so that in the event of a sneak attack, on the one hand, the safety of the head can be ensured, on the other hand, it is guaranteed that all the light sources will not be lost due to an attack. Then he began to think about which way to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike the underground waterway of Lenny, the tunnels excavated for excavation of gold are very confusing. The tunnels are wide and narrow, the corners are not right angles, the pits are not supported, and they are not connected to each other. For Reneka, this is very simple. She just has to choose one direction and dig it down. But for the tracking of the door, he has to guess the direction that Jenny chose, and he has the chance to catch up with six. The gap in hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then, he suddenly felt that there was a wind sweeping past him. The gust of wind was fleeting, and the air in the tunnel immediately returned to the previous dignity. If he doesn't stop, he won't feel the subtle wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it an illusion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tendoor? Soledon waited patiently. After about ten seconds, another wind passed by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not an illusion. The air in the tunnel is flowing. There is only one thing that can make the air flow...magic."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly walked to the next ramp, stopped and waited for the flow of the wind to point him in the direction. He used the phosphor to mark the arrow in the direction of the ground to prevent himself from getting lost in the secret road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the north. To the north. east. To the north. To the north. To the northwest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding tunnel is getting wider and wider, and you can see the wreckage of the decaying wooden track. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the north. To the north. To the northeast. east. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tunnel is skewed downwards and deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind seems to be getting bigger and bigger. He hid two lighting sticks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the north. To the north. To the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tunnel was lifted and lifted quickly, and the collapsed slope blocked the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The digging shovel brought by the door knockout, digs the foot on the slope and climbs up the slope. By glimmering, he found more places to stop, and it took no more than two hours to dig out. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he found himself in a cave that was a little outrageous, and it looked like the underground camp of the laborers when they dug. The dim skylight casts from above and can hear the roar of the shelling outside, but it is not as dense as before. It is already late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the twilight glimmer map, a lonely figure stands there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At her feet are the collapsed rocks and mud wrecks, and the wreckage piled up into a mountain. The top of the mountain is flat and is clearly reinforced by hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her boots are rhythmically stepping on the top of the trash mountain with a light blue glow, just like dancing on the front. Whenever she stepped into the magical array, there was a wind blowing from her side, alternating the air in the tunnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She swayed the song while manipulating the magical array. The song seems to be improvised, and the rhythm is wonderfully in line with her footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Senikan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door screamed and stopped her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You finally came." Renee Wei Lunen jumped from the squad. "You come late, Sorley, I I thought you would be earlier. You alone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door nodded noddedly: "One person. I am not coming to chase you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have something to say? I thought you were all over, Sorelton." Yanika shrugged. "Let's say, What new reasons do you think of persuading me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The war is coming to an end..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;have not waited for the door to continue, and I have inserted impatiently with one of the following: "If you are going to suggest that I go back to the welfare home to avoid the overnight order of Klad, the bastard will be saved. Let me save it. I - Absolutely - No - I agree! I absolutely do not accept this kind of pity, that is what I should do in return for my actions! Not to mention that the victory and defeat are not yet divided, even if the real emperor is defeated, I I would rather escape to the New World. Like a free mage like Miss Hermonte, I don't want to go back to the bastard's wings and ask for pain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This series of beads sprays magical The words, completely hit the entire persuasion plan of Nami, he almost bit his tongue. Just like he knows very much about Seneca, Seneca knows him very well. This kind of persuasion is impossible to be effective. He has to change the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's run away, I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's like throwing a big stone into a calm pond-<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the way to persuade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We run away, 黛妮卡. Elope. Elope. Elope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sentence is like a spell, and it echoes in the ear of Renee. The hand that was playing with his gun was shaking, the trigger flashed, and a silver bullet hit out and crashed into the ruins of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her breath is rushing: "Do you say it again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is lowered, Repeatedly and repeatedly: "I said... let's run away, I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elopement you said is 'male and female because Love flees to the far side of the elopement, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then don't you think that you missed something before this speech?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is missing? Is it a special ceremony for the elopement of the empire? Miss Duke Fegota? I don't seem to have read this record..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 inserted the gun back on the belt, angrily two Step, grab the collar of the door-to-door Soledon uniform, and pull down hard: "Love, stupid! Even love does not mean, where is the elopement!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The door is once again confused: "Love To indicate what kind of ...... "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;? & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; his eyes look for her. Yanika’s eyes were sharp and sharp, and she was waiting anxiously. There is only one answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like you-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is enough." Out of the other hand, grabbed the other half of his collar and yanked down, and looked up and kissed him, interrupting him with his tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the door is stiff. He reacted awkwardly, his arms blindly waving for half a minute, and he mechanically took the opposite sex into his arms. Fortunately, the kiss is still going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep kiss is long, long, and looks like it will last until the end of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the shellings were silent, leaving him and her passionately kissing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this is the fault of free breathing magic and potions. He and she can breathe through the skin, it doesn't matter how long this deep kiss is. The average person has been killed for a long time, and the magicians can keep the kiss all the time, until the minds of both sides are blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonica and Nani are not sure when the kiss ends. When he and she returned to normal consciousness, Nanamen found that his military uniform collar was pulled down, and Nika found that she had a half-length epaulette in her right hand. She turned red and hurriedly handed back the badge to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door passed the epaulette, but did not rush to wear it, but held her hand silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yanika’s shoulders shook a bit, but did not break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "Let's go, leave the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She retorted: " Now? Are you really so free and easy, 'Excellent chapter'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The chapter of excellence is not what I earned." I only touched the medal of the chest. "In the beginning, I was not really a free soldier. You are not a real imperial aristocrat. This is not our war. No matter who wins or loses, it is like you said. Similarly, we can escape to the New World, be a plantation owner, be a free mage, and bring civilization to the barbarians and dwarves there. Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naimeng looked up and looked at the top of the cave: "We don't have to go to the New World. We can go to Interlake, go to Murrayman, do Eastern trade. We can also go to the distant Eastern Empire and be an explorer. Take risks on unfamiliar land. The world is big, really big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You never figured it out. You think it's very good, Very correct and very correct things, not necessarily what others want. You want a peaceful life, but I don't want it. Our essential differences are here, Sorelton."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is it peaceful? Are we not going to risk elopement, 黛妮卡?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who said that we are going to run away ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is wrong: "But, that kiss..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s just a confession to you, and the reward of saving your life before. One of the family trainings of the Figota family is that there is a report.” Princess Von Fegota laughed. Come, "And, I know that you are sincere, but not the only one. If I say that if, in this case, Anne Sefir, you will be as confession."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't." Naimen hurriedly denied. However, he couldn't think of Annie's face self-controlly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just said that you have to leave everything to leave me here. But if you meet Anne on the road and besiege by the emperor, you dare say you are not Will you save her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will go, even if his fighting power is meaningless. He was powerless to argue: "Annie is a magician who is not weaker than you. She will not be trapped."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough, don't argue. You like me, but you like her too. You know, I was in the welfare home last night.” Yanika lowered her tone. “Fran’s teacher saw it. The nun saw it. I saw it. I guess Anne. She also saw it. You like her, don't deny it. Although I don't know if she really likes you, at least she doesn't hate you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you hate me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like you, but I hate being unfair. If I am here with you, it is unfair. I don't want to Becoming a woman like that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 slowly turned around and slowly pulled his hand out of his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just said it. I like you. You like me too. But I won't choose to run away with you now. My answer is , 'I'm sorry. At least, now is 'sorry'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was forced to grab her hand: "But the war is over! Perhaps It takes a long time for us to have a chance to meet again! Do you think that when can I get a different answer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone of 黛妮卡It became a bit melancholy: "When you know what you want to do, I may choose you. I know, maybe you won't need my answer at that time... but now the answer can only be 'sorry' '."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, she took her hand firmly and decisively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not a woman who has an excuse to say something about security. I don't need a false sense of security or a false escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not escaping."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really? You really know what you want. Something, Sorelton? You think it’s very good, very correct and very correct, but it’s instilled in others. It’s the life that Lenny’s everyone wants, the life that nuns and teachers want. Do you really know what you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone of the door is getting weaker and weaker: "I know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know. You don't really want to take risks, you just say that because I want to leave here. You can mix into the Free Army, you can mix the merits After the war, you will continue to mix in the city. Ninety-nine percent of people will live this life. But I won't."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbs;"What can I do with Seneca Lopez, can't do it with Jonica Sorlayton. What can I do with 黛 ? 薇 薇 薇 韦 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费Can't do it. You are inviting me to be a much poorer person than I am now, please forgive me... ah, Soledon, I am not belittle you, just think that you have not found your goal... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more black. The door to Soleton's face has turned into cyan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More terrible than the low is the truth. He didn't even know how to continue to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the shelling resumed at this time. However, this shelling sounds a bit too close...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this low roar, Yanika’s face changed: "Leave here, now Still have time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say?" The door is wrong, "I am leaving? No! I will not give up on you!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think I came here to dig the secret road? Do you know why the artillery fires of yesterday and today are so dense? Do you think I have been moving forward here, what are you doing?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is not an idiot. When he heard such a prompt, he immediately understood that his face became blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have someone to answer?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is not falling, he sees the end of the cave Another ruin mountain is shaking slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, not just the response." Renee opened the other hand and lowered her voice. "Working magic! It's less than fifty meters!" Escape, right away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton bit his teeth and ventured to ask: "Is this the real reason?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 turned his face to the side and didn’t want him to see: “I don’t know. Go ahead.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He didn't say more, he turned and ran. He ran across the corner and ran up the slope that left, suddenly stopped, began to walk in place, and consciously stepped on the lighter. After that, he stumbled back and hid in the shadow of the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not in a hurry to leave because the trump card in his hand has not been turned over yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four companies on standby near the library, each of which participated in the groundwater cleaning operation last month. In this narrow passage, even if the enemy has dozens of imperial knights and magicians, it is not necessarily the opponent of these soldiers who are familiar with the sewer battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ripped open the magic scroll, and released an invisible eye to sneak into the movement of the hall where I was in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many people will be charged by the Duke of Fegota to meet her..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with The last fortification magic, the earth wall broke open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Von? Princess Fegota! You have a hard time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Throughout the tunnel, the emblems of the great aristocrats shine, and the dark passages are like white. The crowd rushed through the narrow tunnel and rushed into the hall, then snarled into the two rows by the wall, flashing a path for the people behind. Almost everyone is decorated with their own family crest and coat of arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Five Dukes' Houses...16 Marquis Houses...Twelve Bishops...eight Associations...Imperial Heroes Medal...First Class Medal... Royal Guardian Knight..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more he recognizes, the more he is scared. He only counted to one hundred and fifty, and almost all of the identification symbols that represented the empire appeared. Who can qualify for such an army? Who can let such a detachment give way to him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""The father of her name, Duke von Figota, will not come in person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Then he saw the answer. From the welcome of the line-up, there is a tall, strong, and majestic old man. His armor looks very old, engraved with the coat of arms of the Figota family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods. That person... that person is really... can only be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡?薇伦?Fengergota The righteous father, Duke of Loren von Figota. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Minister of Military Affairs of the Empire..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised him even more . The old Duke of Loren walked through the queue of nearly two hundred people, but stopped at the end of the queue and sideways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is the Minister of Military Affairs also giving way? That being said, the nephew behind him is -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The emperor of the Holy Empire, Gustav Hugh Coleman."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman subconsciously repeated the name and carefully looked at the person who might be the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person is not very old, the lines of the face are deep, and the expression is cold and resolute. The scepter he held in his hand was very long. As he progressed, he hit the ground and gave a rhythmic snoring. Somehow, when he stared at the emperor's figure, he gradually ignored the lame. For this person, lameness seems to be an unimportant feature. The firm will of the emperor gave the impression that it was far above his lame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a person who is worthy of the title of "Emperor". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gustav emperor stopped in front of Monica. He kneeled and kissed her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the eyes of the investigation, Nana can hear the emperor’s speech. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gustav’s Majesty said: “I represent the Empire, thank you for your contribution to the Empire, Princess Von Fegota.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should have thought of it. How can the emperor be satisfied with the use of human life to fill the wall? Lenny's defense is so strong, the defenders are so numerous! If the emperor is constantly backed up, they can be surrounded by the city; but now...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The emperor wants to break the country from the inside. Determined, terrible power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the general direction of the empire. In this nicknamed "Imperial Diving Tunnel", for the first time in history, the Empire was born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that the emperor has been dead. In the vast ocean that the Free Army has mobilized again and again, the emperor who will do the grain and grass has no way to go. Here, it is the last bet of the emperor, and the shelling outside is just a blind eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The artillery shells can't be taken away anyway", in the Imperial General Staff, someone must say so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, I have provided them with a path from within. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Emperor organized such a large-scale siege warfare to disperse the defense of the Free Army. Therefore, they organized such a large-scale artillery to cover up the sound of underground magical progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly 100,000 troops were scattered on the third and fourth walls, while in the first and second districts, only one multi-military division was on duty. This is their best prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the first batch of attackers has only two hundred people, but with the elite level of these two hundred people, they have a chance of winning. After removing the detachment sent to Jena, all the elites of the siege units are almost here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the real reason why I don't want to leave: from the beginning, she has no way to go. But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door does not want to see it anymore. He turned lightly and gently, walked along the road he was coming in, and erased everything that looked like a sign. Renee should also keep a copy; he found some of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a great credit for the Medal of Excellence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, his legs began to tremble. Although trembling, it runs faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
