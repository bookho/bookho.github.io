			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of Lenny’s people raised their heads and looked at the night sky that should have had no abnormalities. In this cold winter snow night, there will be sunshine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a brilliant sun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot sun that poured over the earth without reservation and without cover! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That illuminates everything, warms everything, and lets all the blood races that perch in the dark tremble and turn into the ashes of the sun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge magical dimension interface stops below the clouds, covering the thick clouds, leaving the night and shadows invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summer sun that was converted from the island of Nanxinzhou passed through the interface and poured into the city without reservation. The air is scented with tropical sea breeze, and the scene is like a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just “like dreams”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the dream reaches its highest point, it often declares the bursting of dreams. This dreamy sunshine is already an elegy that breaks the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reality is like a needle, it always pierces people's dreams. When the dreams are shattered, people will see the cruel reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riss; Sefer understands that she has almost nothing - but she can't lose more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...hold person!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least, she has time to save her Friends in this era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton raised his head and was surprised to see the hot sun pouring over the earth. When he saw the sun, he understood that this was the opportunity he wanted. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, he was wearing the Lieutenant’s ensign of the Liberal Army, mixed in the defeat of the leader of Lymda. The military uniform was taken from the body of the St. Grace's Welfare Institute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he rushed back to the welfare home, the Lyme Daren had withdrawn from their only loot. Perhaps it is impossible to kill children and those who loved them in the past. The generals simply locked other people in a small room. There, he came up with this plan to save Yanika. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, it’s not difficult to get into the defeated team, especially for a magician. Although Soledon does not have "advanced" magic like stealth, but the first stage of magic like charm is enough for the soldiers to agree with this "no platoon leader". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he still can't find a chance to get close to Nonica. The girl was watched by ten soldiers, and Soledon could not find a chance to approach, let alone give the ring to her - the Velentina solemnly asked for his transmission ring. He does not have the power to control magic, he has no ability to create opportunities - he has never been as resentful as he is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, give me a chance..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he prayed He saw the dazzling sunshine. He has no time to think about the cause of this phenomenon - but he knows that he has been waiting for this opportunity for a long time. He noticed that everyone was looking up at the sky and was unaware of the surrounding situation...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, a deliberately suppressed magic in Soledon Blasting around. He felt that the magic touched his will and flashed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to him, is there a magician acting nearby? However, it seems that it is a friend...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seized the opportunity, climbed the flatbed, and quietly approached Yanika, the amethyst The stone ring was worn on her finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...In your mind, go to a safe place! Hurry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purple transmission magic light illuminates, 黛尼卡; Lopez disappears into the air with magical fluctuations and goes to a safe place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reese, who was about to fall to the ground, stunned and looked at the mysterious magician who was wearing a scorpion uniform and saved 黛nica from the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this distance, she can't recognize his appearance, but she can recognize the magical features of the "error-free transmission." Even in the era she came from, it was a very advanced and difficult to master magic. That must be a great mage, she judged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a faint smile on her face: "...I will give it to you here, thank you for saving her."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concealed word was passed through the letter to the officer’s ear. The "Lesser Officer" who just jumped out of the car and hid in the crowd looked around and raised his right thumb as a response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing this response, Reese; Sefer turned and flew in the direction of her sister. Her figure is always hidden in the sun, and no one has seen it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you...but what should I do now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whispered to the unknown After the teacher thanked him, Soledon began to consider his own problem of getting out. He grabbed his head and looked around: the Lopez army was ten times their strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really troublesome," he muttered. "It’s better to surrender."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"True trouble "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found out that the hostages had disappeared; Lemda muttered to himself and almost stopped thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before, the hot sun pouring over the earth almost dazzled him. He thought that his senses had made a mistake and blinked: but the sun was still projected on the ground. Lymda turned his attention to the array of the other side and found that all the soldiers of the Lopez army also raised their heads. The soldiers were staring at the sunlight in the air, and they were unaware of the previous "going forward" command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to break through, it is now! Major General Lymda, who made this decision, turned sharply and found that...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hostages were gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt a dizzy stun: Is such a big magic just to save the guy’s daughter? Clade; Where is Lopez sacred? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hands are lifted, put down, lifted up, and put down. Facing the unfathomable enemy, he has not dared to issue an offensive command. After the previous coercion, he also has no hope for the choice of "surrender." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I still have an invisible cloak..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sudden pop-up idea, He shuddered. Do you want to abandon the remaining subordinates, choose the road that you are stealing and stealing? Should you completely abandon the honor? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His lips trembled, showing the struggle in his heart. He finally made the decision... the most "reasonable" decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let my body hide..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn’t finished the startup password yet, A blue light crossed his neck, cut out a neat gap, and blood rushed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Farewell, Major General Lemda. I will give you a glorious death as a final gift."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crad; Lopez did not look back, not once. He just stepped forward and forward, as if nothing had happened before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man does not dare to look back because he is afraid that he will collapse in grief after turning back. From the moment he made his decision, he could only continue to move forward and fight against the enemy forces in the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vampire "tax officials" and "knights" who are trying to control the mood of the crowd have raised their heads and looked at the transparent night sky with surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before they responded, the sun was completely poured on them. The pale and delicate skin was exposed to the sun, and immediately turned from white to light brown, and turned into dark brown, light black, and dark black until it began to emit green smoke. Those bloods of the cursed blood are thinner in half a minute, and the more powerful blood races can only support them, calling on their companions who are not afraid of the sun to escort them into the shadows nearby. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like no human beings can use magic in the event of a serious injury, and no blood can play in the sun. The control of mental power immediately relaxes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who are being manipulated use wake up from the passionate emotions and look at each other to confirm the current situation. They also raised their heads and looked at the daylight that illuminates everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is going on here? Why is the day bright again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'call for peace "What kind of things do you have to do with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is an army... Escape!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wave is spread from the forefront of the team. As the first, second, and third people began to escape, the crowd gradually swayed. I don't know where it started, the array of parades began to collapse. The crowds quickly flew into the streets of Lenny, faster than when they gathered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The front shot is facing up!" A timely order was issued from the headquarters of Lopez. "The cavalry team turned in and dispelled the crowd! Leave the ninth After cleaning the local battlefield with the temple, the rest of the troops immediately accepted the new order and opened it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was still a deep lock on the brow, and the command was completed. A new assignment map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cavalry rushed along with several main roads, speeding up the dispersal. Some civilians die while trampling on each other, but this has no effect on the trajectory of history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defensive wall in front of the Lopez army disappeared, and the balance of the victory began to tilt again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, there is good news, Miss Nika may not have died yet..." Hull returned with a new report. In the headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cradd just smiled bitterly and gestured to stop him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After I made a decision to sacrifice her, I was already dead as my daughter. She couldn't come back here. It’s impossible to be my daughter again.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lieutenant wants to turn over the horse and shake his legs, but he can’t go up. He tried it again, and it took the horse back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand her because she is also Lopez."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, He never mentioned anything about his daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a bloody blood in the hand, and the vampire prince who stands in the high place is also raising his head, looking at the room through the glass window with surprise. sunlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ray of sunshine hits the hand of his tall glass, leaving a small stain. The prince felt a sting, and the subconsciously threw away the glass and yanked down the heavy curtains. He stepped back two steps, letting the darkness cover his own figure again. The sun is not fatal to him, but it is by no means something that makes him feel comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is simply beyond the calculation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contingency plan developed by the Prince is enough Coping with the situation of all the high-ranking pastors of the Orthodox and Protestant, but never imagined that "the night turns into a day." He quickly calculated the changes that would happen in this situation - each result made him frightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched the burn on his hand, walked quickly to the desk, picked up a magic communication item with the word "sound only", and contacted "王" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I ask you to cancel the action. Whether it is a miracle or a manpower, the ability of the other side is beyond the Lennie branch, and even the entire southern region can cope. Limit. We need to conduct further investigations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I allow, the action is cancelled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing this, he answered with peace of mind, the Prince was soft and leaned back in the chair. Finally, the worst ending can be avoided, he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All personnel pay attention, immediately withdraw to each masking place! Repeat it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He I only hope that the loss can be smaller and smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "bishop" and "knight" who are chasing the mysterious enemy also raised their heads and looked at the fiery sunshine pouring over the earth. . In just one moment, the "bishop" who led the team understood the danger of the situation. Almost half of the combat power he possesses is a vampire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Bishop" Lich quickly slammed the wall with the withered hand, and the wall of the mansion was immediately lifted three times and projected on the inside of the yard. Long shadows. The undead creatures immediately shrunk the line of defense into the shadows, waiting for the command to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open fire, don't let them escape!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Batish" uses her sexy The voice gave the order - this moment, she has been waiting for a long time. After being chased for a long time, she finally waited for the opportunity to counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The garrison’s soldiers gathered and picked up their weapons. Countless holy waters flashed white, mixed with three-pound artillery shells, and shot together in the corner. Holy water is used to smear flesh and blood, while shells are used to break bones. Each shell is pre-packaged with silver and engraved with a sacred prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s ridiculous! With this false prayer, I want to overtake us?!......force wall!" The bishop suddenly burst into anger Drink, stand up, hand in front of the line, an imaginary wall suddenly appears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I don’t see you as a decent Orthodox priest. How did it turn into a lich?" Barthew sneered, " High elevation angle throw!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her command, the elevation angle of the already prepared catapult was raised, and the guards used the elastic force to bounce the holy water to the shadow Over the area. The blue-haired girl stretches out the fingers and lets the light blue magic bullets focus on the fingertips, accurately exposing those holy waters that are thrown to a fixed position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That has nothing to do with you!" The lich took a shot on the wall with his right hand, and the high wall became a pergola, blocking the fallen holy water. . However, the "Knights" around him still suffered a lot. Annoyed and angry, his left hand stretched out, and a beam of light shot from his fingertips, bypassing the force field and directly hitting a guard. The guard screamed, and he had many blood-filled blood vessels, entangled the people around him, and they could not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quickly cut them!" When I saw this blood-scraping magic, Bartholette was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Explosive!" The bishop said coldly about the triggering spell. The man who was hit by the ray immediately turned red, and large and small blood bubbles flowed out along the blood vessels, which could turn into deadly blood bombs at any time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, a red meteor sword rain crossed the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless red swords piercing into the body like a rainstorm, and a dense network of blood is being made underground. The people who escaped their lives hurriedly avoided and turned their eyes to the direction of the sword rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leisha; Helmont is standing at the window, holding the sword as a trophy in his hand: "It turned out that this thing is to manually fill the magic... ... Anyway, I hope that my shot will be timely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, it was very timely." Barthew smiled. "Now we should fight back. Town Soul Array, start!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The soul of the town? Are you talking about the things that Delana did for the fools?" It seems that I heard something very funny. Things, the "bishop" suddenly laughed. "Do you have time to paint? The magical array that is full of holy water, and you have to paint for 10 minutes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed and ejected another blood-splitting ray from his right hand and fired at the soldiers who maintained another artillery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
