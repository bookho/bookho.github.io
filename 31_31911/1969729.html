			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital of the Republic of Intra-republic, south city (southpolis, old Taiping)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth **Participating Country of the Republic of the Republic, the Republic of the Republic is the wealthiest country in the civilized world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is called the lock key of the flow route and the last country to join the provincial federations. The “Double Island Republic” Interre’s population accounts for only one-eighth of the population of the Republic, but it is responsible for the logistics of the most powerful fighters of the Free Army: the first division “Republic” and the second division “British” "Tray", the 14th Division "Zhuhai", the first national division "curved sword", the second national division "Trident", the third national division "double-edged sword" and the ninth national division "dragon gun" all Relying on Intra's trade tax to maintain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its capital is Farn City, located in the center of the West Island, surrounded by mountains and rivers. Although it is the capital, Yuannan City is not the largest city in the country. The population and economy are the third largest cities. The largest city is the phase port of Westport, and the second largest city is the phase port of Donggang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third largest city in the country, can become the capital of the Republic, because the city has a history of prestige, and a more prestigious name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the more than 300 years of Taiping’s domination of Shuangdao, Yuannan City was the de facto capital of the entire Yellow Turban Taiping State, until the Komans were gods. The name once again conquered the South, where the establishment of the Duke of Intre and the Governor’s Office of the Far East. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its last name is Taiping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when the news of the change of the Taoist regime passed to the far south city, the shock was even more intense. If the people of Hong Kong only think that this is a good opportunity to make big money, the members of the Far South City see an earthquake that is enough to change the distribution of the entire Republic and even the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is paying more attention to the politics of the country than the Interlakes. For the imperialists and even the Lennys, the peace and the people are very distant legends; for the elves, the kingdom means gold; for the orientals, the people are fierce insurgents and pirates; but For the Interlakes, the Dao is one of the most important maritime neighbors of Inter, and the Tao is a reality that can be seen every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forty's population is 40% of the population or the Eastern ethnic group. In the twenty-nine prefectures and cities of the Republic of Intra-Republic, there are 50 members of the Parliament, one quarter of which are Taoists, and one third of them believe in the Taiping Road. For the Republic of Intres, the country has always been a huge monster that is difficult to compete with. Since the liberty found that the Elf Navy entered the East, the Elf Seas and the Eastern Company have been fighting the traditional trade fleet of the Intres. Even if you get a trading port or a colony, you need the fleet to bleed to fight for it. This struggle was carried out in the era when Interry was still led by the Duke of Intres, and the struggle became even more intense as the Duke became the Republic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this hundred-year-old movement suddenly made a full stop. Originally it was only a customary colonial raid, but it defeated the Zhang Futu regime that had been with the Elven Navy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Farnan realized that with this opportunity, the ports and colonies within the entire country will have a chance to completely reshuffle, they can The elf strongholds were wiped out and replaced with their own power - even in the territory of the kingdom of the country to obtain new good ports and concession colonies. Since then, the colonial ports of the Freedoms will go all the way to the east, directly to Lingyangmen, the home of the Eastern Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cotai Strip is unfolding in front of politicians, but there is still a small question: Should this Cotai Strip be controlled by speculators in Phase Harbor? The politicians in the far south city worry about the country and the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Far South City reacted, they suddenly found out that speculators in Phase Port had begun to form new fleets and troops. After the loss of Lennie, refugees from the city of Ruhrock and the capital region flooded into Interlake, providing sufficient manpower and funding for the new phase port Eastern Route Company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those thoughts of the pressure and bribery of the previous phase of the port, they gave them a concession, and some people in the Intrex Council regretted it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I knew that they could win the Green Bull House, and it would be a lot of money in it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if there is still a chance to get in. If the country is so big, can we let us get some benefits?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that building In the style-built parliament hall, the members of the parliament exchanged their dissatisfaction and opinions in private. From time to time, they will cast their doubts and embarrassment on the five members from the two cities of the East and West, as well as five or six other representatives from other ports and counties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like most republics, the Interstate Republican Parliament is divided into two major alliances, the Conservative Party Alliance and the Federal League, according to "political opinion". There are three or four small parties; but in reality, political alliances are directly divided according to geography and interests. Members from the capital city of Faran City and nearby counties, and the members of the two-city city from the largest trading port, are almost always in two different leagues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, inland agriculture and handicraft counties are poor, but their militia have established republics with more representation; trade port cities Although wealthy, the voice in the parliament is not so strong. Far South City represents the former, while Phase Harbor represents the latter. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to more than a dozen members serving in Fort Vatican or in the military government, there are 37 Republicans in the city of Faran for daily routines. Decision-making, most of them belong to the ally of Faran City. If it is a weekday, the number of members present will probably only be 60%, but today it is rare to be fully attended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is because this meeting will discuss the issue of the covenant with the new regime of the Taiping Dao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the schedule, the conqueror of the country, the Intrepids, Jeanne Soleton will return to the South and the city by sending magic to the parliament and the army today. The Ministry reported and conveyed to the Parliament the goodwill of the Yellow Turban. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheduled time has not yet arrived, there is a rain-like hooves coming from outside the parliament, sounding like a brigade cavalry passed recently. A moment later, a young soldier with a stern expression and a savvy look and eyes entered the main hall of the Interre Council with more than a dozen active military personnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than half of the members immediately stood up and greeted the guests; the other half only slightly succumbed to their position. The two factions are very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome the Special Envoy of the Freedom Army Staff Conference, Lieutenant Colonel Hull Tedwood to the Intercontinental Council!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Speaker of the Interstate Council greeted him and shouted the name and rank of the person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This name provoked a small discussion among parliamentarians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lieutenant Colonel Tedwood, isn't that the right hand of Marshal Clade Lopez..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The cronies but the status is not high, the decision of the marshal is really subtle. Will it support the Conservative Party?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special envoy took off the military cap , revealing a short black hair with a slight curvature. He put his general cap on his chest and gave a ceremonial ritual to the speaker and the parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Marshal received an invitation from your parliament to send me to discuss the logistics and strategic issues concerning the Intres."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lieutenant Colonel Hull looks around the council. He saw that in the wide Eastern-style hall, the seats were placed more densely than in the past. The reserved rows of seats are distributed on both sides of the parliamentary seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Intercontinental Parliament does not have a fixed seat and floor as the Lenny’s United Parliament, but only uses the Oriental style armchair to present the parliament’s seats and Come to the guest table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that there are other people who are invited to come. The middle is definitely for the conquerors of the Tao, and the other is... "Is the fleet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing Hull’s speculation, the speaker replied: "This is the case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that your picture is not small."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her let the officers and guards around him sit down on one side and go straight After walking to the rostrum of the Central Committee of the Parliament, he said: "Since you specifically asked us to arrive early for a hearing... I must have doubts about the military's strategy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Seeing that the opposite side intends to launch an offensive, the members of the Westport, representing the phase port, straight up from the seat, and put their hands on the table in front of them, focusing on the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colleague around him whispered to him: "Do the Conservatives ask the route company to withdraw troops from the country?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter. It's not a problem to prove the value of the country's interests. It is not a problem to build two divisions. Even if they are forced to pass here, we can also refute it in the joint parliament. To incite the company's concession, it is a daydream, involving so many amounts of concession, which is what Yuannan City wants to take back and recover..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name The Conservative MPs sorted out the lectures in front of them and spoke up. Others quickly lowered the volume in a courtesy manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to question Lieutenant Colonel Tedwood's question. In the case of an armistice agreement with the Empire, from a military perspective, the First Republic Can the division and the Second Intres can be withdrawn from the mainland and put on the front of the Taoist country?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this question, Hull’s eyes Immediately, the members of the Port of Hong Kong exchanged their surprised look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me confirm again." Hull coughed. "You want to, withdraw the two elite divisions of the Free Army from Fort. And East Ruhrock, is it on the battlefield of the Tao?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the front line can draw two divisions, it should be diplomatic to the Tao And the business is very helpful. I just asked about this possibility and asked Colonel Tedwood to answer it truthfully."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to my judgment, it will be A huge gap has formed on the front. The emperor* has occupied our capital and has stationed heavy troops among them. If it does not maintain its equivalent or even more troops, it will pose a huge threat to the security of the Republic."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand. Then, if the Interstate Council severs the supply of the above two divisions and logistics, and transfers them to the direction of the country, Tedwood Did the Lieutenant Colonel think it would have serious consequences?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her shook his head: "That must be It will have very serious consequences. The soldiers and logistics are the core of the war, especially the two divisions are in positive contact with the enemy and maintain their combat status every day. However, I feel that the country is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, my question is over." Waiting for Hull to finish, the member of the parliament saluted him and then sat back in position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for Hull to react, and then a Conservative Party member stood up and continued to ask the next question:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is Lieutenant Colonel Tedwood, do you think it makes sense to strategically transfer the Free Army and military spending to the Taoist countries..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions one after the other are all based on the position of the aiding country. Involved in the allocation of military expenses and strategic issues, Hull did not dare to answer without looking at the clerk who was working hard. After all, any response he made to Nami Soleton could be turned into a reason to cut the military budget by the Interstate Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These guys..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Member of Phase Port, Sam Webster Wrinkles Brows. The opponent's tactics can be described as the next three, but they do not have a good way to deal with it. The Conservative Party has always stood on the standpoint of cutting military spending, unlike the Federalists who value the interests of the Republic. Now they have seized the PLA’s military expenses as hostages, and they have seized the military and military expenses of the land and sea forces in the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As the Archbishop estimated, it’s not very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Webster Thinking hard, but I can't think of how to defeat the two plots of the Conservative Party at the same time. He remembered the prophecy of Bonnie Sefer, another major shareholder of the route company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Intracles Council will probably try every means to frame our people in order to gain real control of the company. Just plug in their key positions. There are many ways to transfer the actual interests of the people, or the army under their control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hinted that several members of the Federalist Party stood up and tried to justify the defense of the door and the route company, but they were picked up by the opposite issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you add additional investment to the Taoist countries, is it necessary to reduce the funds invested in the first and second divisions?"<br />< Br /> /> </ br> ” ” ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The concessionaire has been tax-free for several years. Does the concessionaire have to fill the gap in the military for the parliament?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arrogance has become more and more arrogant, and a memorandum has begun to be drafted. Mr. Webster simply stops speaking and looks at the opposite side to continue to use his imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He whispered his secretary and asked him to use magic to send a message to Nana Soleton, who is coming here, and to the route company. A major shareholder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When receiving information from Webster Colonel Neroe Soleton and the "rabier" Colonel Schlopp Cliff just emerged from the transmission location of Far South City, waiting for the local garrison to mobilize horses and carriages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Webster said that he couldn’t stand it. It seems that this job will be very difficult. The guys in Farnan City are determined to be We have a lot of money on our body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door-to-door situation was relayed to Cliff, in exchange for a burst of laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go by them. Anyway, I have already taken thousands of pounds of stock, now it has risen two or three times, there are tens of thousands of pounds? Big deal." Lao Tzu does not do this damn colonel, sell the stock, go to Imam to buy a farm, or go to the Green Bull House to find an instructor position. At that time, brothers, you have to be a young and beautiful little for me. A few words in front of the teacher, give a good position..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which thing? I don't have the ability to speak for you in front of Miss Zhang Shiyi." Before I left, I was offended by her." Nanimen smiled twice and opened the subject. "Let's go, the horse has already found it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The two men and the Guards launched the horse, got on the carriage, and drove along the avenue to the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time back to Farnan City, due to the insistence of Bonnie Seifer, Nanimen and Cliff brought more than 100 guards. Such a large number of people spent a large amount of transmission materials through the transmission of magic, but fortunately, no luck was transmitted. After seeing the bill for the delivery of materials, Naomi made a secret decision, and the next time he was looking for a boat to walk the sea safely - and then send it a few times, the treasury of Zhuhai Division will run the mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you think of going back to the Interstate Council to ask for money, Nana is feeling a lot of pressure. Now his military expenses are still raised through bonds. In the future, he will pay back through the seizure, the airline company dividends and the military. To this end, he deliberately gathered all the officers in the two divisions and the gendarmerie, prepared a large report to persuade the Intercontinental Parliament to continue to pay the military. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if you don't pay for the military, at least don't bother to break into bad things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he I can only think about it in my heart. To stop the greed of these members, I am afraid that even Bonnie or Webster can't do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market in Faran City can be described as colder than the phase port. The shape of the city was built in the past when the city was built with reference to Murrayman's Green Cattle House and the East Shuntian House. The road is extremely spacious and can accommodate 16 horses or even 24 horses and ride. From the transfer point in the suburbs to the parliament, it took a quarter of an hour, even before they were notified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the door finally arrived, it happened that the Intracles Council was going to pass the Tedwood memo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a memo that can be summed up as "a hairless". Under the inquiries of the Conservative Party, they successfully recorded every gold pound in this memo: all expenses of the Free Army in the country, from logistics to pensions, should be recorded on the military bill. The first and second divisions are deducted from the future expenses. In order to make up for the deficit of the Free Army, the Parliament will hold the right to impose a special tax on the concessionaire -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bulletin of the guard at the door interrupted the proceedings in the parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speaker looked down at the memo in his hand and snorted, and did not stand up to meet. Mr. Webster of Phase Port immediately realized that this was an opportunity to reverse the direction of the proceedings. His huge body bounced off his seat and kicked the chair open, and he rushed to the door of the parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are individuals who are faster than him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lieutenant Colonel Hull Tedwood waved his hand, and all the officers and guards behind him stood up at the same time, while respecting the military ceremony. Their movements are so neat, it sounds like there are only one or two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Special Envoy of the Staff Council himself crossed the entire parliament hall with a magical quick step and stopped in front of the two who had just entered the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was commissioned by Marshal Clade Lopez to convey his greetings to the two." Hull tried to raise his mouth and tried to pretend to be Clad. Lopez had a little bit of a smile. "Lord Marshal said, doing a good job and winning a beautiful one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, Ninmen opened his mouth. I want to say something, but I don't know what to say. This sentence reminds him of his own, but his own childhood, Jenica Lopez. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Jenny can hear her father praise her, she should be very happy, he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition, I also brought a compliment from Conti Fox's dictator. He said that the winner is not blamed."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Hull Tedwood honoured a military service to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Finally, I personally, on behalf of the Freedom Army Staff Conference, congratulations to the conquerors of the country for their smooth triumph."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." He glanced at Cliff, who was busy fixing the cap he had brought. "In order to sacrifice the high-ranking generals and comrades in the land of the Tao."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the dialogue between the two men, the Speaker of the Intercontinental Parliament spoke with both hands On the stage, a dull sound was heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lieutenant Tedwood! The memo you just confirmed -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hull Afterwards, he shook his head against the speaker: "I can only confirm the military issue. The political issues of the local council, the staff meeting is not intended to intervene, but the military expenses in the memorandum must be met."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Webster cast a bit of sympathy on the speaker. Hull’s performance undoubtedly represents the will of the two giants of the military; under such pressure, the speaker cannot win enough supporters. After all, most of the members also know that the regime’s regime change will definitely result. A lot of wealth. They don't think they really fight against the Free Army, they just want to take a slice of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The gap in the will of battle." Webster sighed in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the military, the fragility of the parliament is too obvious. The Conservative Party Alliance thought that the headquarters of the Free Army, which earned profits from the Taoist countries, would support them to share a piece of cake, but did not expect that the Liberation Army would choose to support themselves even in the face of interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speaker lost his mind for a moment, only once again looked up and looked at Soledon and Cliff, who were heading towards the middle of the parliament with empty eyes. The lawmakers sitting near Webster stood up and clapped their hands as if they were going to chase him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speaker looked at the Websters in the middle of these people with resentment, as if he had identified him as the mastermind. His right hand trembled for a moment, as if he had made up his mind and made a lot of waves in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, a new Conservative Party member stood up and said loudly: "I accuse! I accuse the National Security Officer of the Interstate Council Colonel Lope Cliff privately accepted a large bribe from the Eastern Route Company. In order to gain benefits, he commanded his National Army to launch an adventurous attack without authorization, causing the death of his colleagues! I proposed to remove the position of the National Guardian Master! At the same time, I proposed There is solid evidence that Daro Salami, commander of the Fifth Fleet of the Haimao Commission, has also received a large bribe from the Eastern Route Company. I have a list of their stock transactions here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Webster side looked at the speaker with a blank look, and were surprised that the opponent had such courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the National Guard and the Maritime Commission are theoretically attributed to the parliamentary administration. As long as the parliament considers the evidence to be conclusive, the bill can be removed by its passage...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you do this for the benefit of the Eastern Route Company? Even if you forcefully change to your people, you can’t deprive the fleet or replace the seamasters. And the **Gendarmerie, I really thought that this would force the company to negotiate with you for money?" Webster secretly stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after he got the documents distributed by the Conservative Party, Webster had a slight change in his efforts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the Speaker is also very prepared for this "second set of programs". He was embarrassed to circumvent the 14th Division and the gendarmes: after the military government dissolved the joint parliament, these people were theoretically not under the jurisdiction of the parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this as a breakthrough, they can fire at the entire route company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He probably sent a lot of people in the phase port? He even got a special dividend from the Eastern Route Company to the fleet and the national division. If they can use this The document, then pulled to other allies..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more the Webster turned over the document, the more surprised he was, the data inside was viewed as his shareholder It is also very accurate. The previous contempt for the Conservative Party has also disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nami Soleton and Shrope Cliff also got the documents. In the roar of the surrounding parliamentarians "bringing bribes" and "running dogs", the two exchanged a worried look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crief couldn’t help but stand up and get up: "Yes! This uncle is collecting some stocks, but this is also the stock that was exchanged for life." We were killed by Zhang Futu’s pro-military forces! For you, will you send yourself to death for thousands of pounds!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He The language is loud, but in the eyes of lawmakers, it is full of loopholes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But accepting bribes is taking bribes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not collecting money, you will be so dangerous The place to attack!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why the 14th division’s division commander will die, that is not what you say casually!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Voting! Vote! We requested from the staff meeting to withdraw the positions of these greedy officers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is also the Sea Trade Committee The executive meeting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in this turbulent public opinion, Webster hesitated. The evidence on the opposite side is so conclusive that it is almost certain that a bill of condemnation can be passed. Although the bill may not be enforceable, the opposite has proved that they have the ability to find trouble for the route company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Federal Party members desperately resisted the opposite speech, Webster called his secretary and asked him to contact another major shareholder to solve the problem. situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hesitation of the Federal Party members made the opposite arrogance even more arrogant. In the face of such pressure, the representative of the military department of Hull is not convenient to open, but it is even more resistant to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voices of opposition were swallowed in a blink of an eye, denying their voices into a snoring sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Condemn corruption and accept bribes! Condemn abuse of power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"President, pass the bill!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speaker of the Conservative Party held up the raft and knocked heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us vote!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invoking his voice and one vote In the agreement, the "rabies" Cliff slowly stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What I take is what I think I deserve. If you think that I don't deserve the money, you will condemn it, I don't care! I am this. The country has paid so much, not to protect you from these greedy locusts!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
