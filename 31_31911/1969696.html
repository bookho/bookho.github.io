Soledon Temporary Major Station At the end of the walkway, bear the wind pressure brought by the cheers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the members in front of him turned their heads and stared at him like he wanted to nail him to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the so-called “war hero” that attracts the attention of parliamentarians, but behind him, there is a rhythmic cheer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more than 10,000 free soldiers outside are screaming rhythmically with the harsh words, listening to the cold sweat on the back of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are calling "Excellent Chapter!" "Excellent Chapter!". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fanatic shout is no stranger to him, and the citizens of every free country are no strangers. Whenever a Republican or a member of the House of Representatives campaigns, there will be large and small campaigns to be held in various places. Such shouts can be heard at every campaign rally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the enthusiasm of all active military personnel is not so easy to hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the deafening shouts, the member of the parliament who spoke on the rostrum seemed so weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is speaking that Webster’s provisional speaker is the deputy leader of the Federal Party, the largest party in the parliament. Before the retiring of the former lieutenant general, he served as the head of the logistics and the second "Intre" division commander. He is currently the chairman of the Military and Armaments Committee. He is one of the recognized strong members of the parliament. He temporarily led the Federal Party after the disappearance of the speaker last night. In the previous debate, he and the Federalist Party insisted that they should temporarily abandon Lenny from a military perspective and were unanimously opposed by all the opposition parties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I admit that the merits of the majors are indeed remarkable. However, the two chapters of excellence are awarded to the same person in a battle, which is not yet in the history of the republics. I don't think that such a rash honour can be used as a commendation, only to reduce the quality of the medal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Webster repeatedly paused , mix your own breathing, and make your voice look full of gas. Even if he is, he has never dealt with such a tense situation. The sweat kept flowing from the forehead of the temporary speaker, just like a rookie politician who gave a speech to the public for the first time. He didn't dare to turn on the magic of the sound because he was afraid of shouting outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, you are just awkward! After the third medal was cast ten years ago, the remaining medals of excellence are really only the last one, but this is not ours. Reasons! We can recast!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senior leader of the Conservative Party of the largest opposition party, Arnold, directly stood up and retorted. If it wasn't for Fox to mention the door before, he would really think that the Conservative Party is the right side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't deny that the budget is one of the issues we should consider..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, Webster's subconscious mind glanced at the direction of Commander Fox with incomprehensible eyes. It seems that it is strange that the old Marshal who has remained silent will propose such a proposal that clearly pays attention to immediate interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Webster and Fox were former colleagues of the military, long-term competition for the highest position of the Free Army, and finally the hero of the Northern Line defeated the Interre, but two People still cherish each other. Webster did not believe that Fox would come up with such a messy proposal. He felt that "Kegler's Fox" must have a further purpose, but he still could not see what it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But between this pause, the shouting outside has become even bigger, and now the entire square is roaring. Their snoring interrupted all discussions in the parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Driven by the shouts behind him, the doorman walked a few steps forward and stopped, not knowing where he should stand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that from a rational point of view, what Webster is saying is correct. The Medal of Excellence is not only costly, but also the most advanced Wu Xun in the country. In the event that the war does not know when it will end, the proposal to recreate a new batch of new ideas is tantamount to idiots. After all, the Higher Enchanting Medal is different from the ordinary bronze medal. It is not made by manufacturing. The cost of manufacturing light and the mobilization of the manufacturer are a lot of expenses. The Conservatives don't care about these expenses: the ruling party is always rational, and the opposition party is always chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Webster is still surrendering. He reached out to the Commander-in-Chief of Fox and gave up the podium: "...but I also respect the military's opinion. The Commander-in-Chief, I will hand it over to you. The Federal Party will not oppose your opinion." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conti? Fox did not immediately stand up, but leaned forward slightly, and his eyes fell on the Conservative leader, Mr. Arnold, who sat down below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arnold looked back at the door behind him, ignoring the rituals he had held in the past, rubbing his sweat on his forehead with his sleeve: "As long as you are Commander Fox As soon as the whole army goes into battle and destroys the imperialist aggressors, our Conservative Party will always stand on your side!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new commander of the Free Army and Freedom Navy finally stood up Come, slowly walked to the floor, facing the rest of the members, opened the switch of the loudspeaker. No one can use magic anymore, but fortunately the magic items still work as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, as a representative of the military, I suggest that you agree to this special honour proposal. Very meritual, there should be a very reward." Speaking one word at a time, the outside noise was temporarily suppressed. "So, please vote. The situation is urgent. I think it is better to use the standing up vote. You said yes, the temporary speaker?"<br />< Mr. Webster broke his mouth, but in the end he was unable to ring the raft: "The standing vote is also in line with the constitution of the province. I agree, then, Conti? Fox The Commander’s motion was voted on.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire Conservative Party’s parliamentarians stood up and the members of the Federalist faction’s factions were hesitantly As soon as they stood up, many of them still felt a sudden sudden reversal of the Marshals. Before today, the former Marshal of Fox had always been an ally of the rational Federal Party. Even the position of Commander-in-Chief was adopted with the unanimous support of the two major parties. I do not know why today suddenly proposed these proposals that would obviously be opposed by senior Webster members. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fox’s mouth twitched slightly, waving his hand to the door to the floor. The new majors looked around and then slowly hesitated to approach the parliamentary seat at the end of the parliament. The old marshal used this time to open the showcase, and took out a medal of excellence as the highest honor display, and hanged on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is trying to say a few resignations, and Fox suddenly took a few shots on his back with his strong arm. Road: "Let us applaud for the first double excellence chapter in the history of the province!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members’ applause screamed, the soldiers outside The shouts were more tidy and warm. The door-to-door support for the hard wooden table of the speaker, a little embarrassingly bowed his head, staring at the joint parliamentary coat of arms engraved on the table, the coat of arms of the four republics and various magic circuits, dare not look up. For everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorkeeper noticed that the magic loop on this table is quite complicated and seems to have a fight with the table of the speaker. In addition to the obvious sound reinforcement and defensive magic, there is also an alarm magic and a loop similar to the inscription of the anchor point engraved on the table. Thanks to the fact that he had seen the inscription of the inscription at Anne's secret transmission point, he could identify the inscription. Somehow, the part that represents the external alert request is flashing, but Conti Fox is just not paying attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and found that Webster, who was returning to his position as the temporary speaker, was also staring at the external alarm magical reminder on his desktop. There is a loss. Conti Fox Commander is still talking, he has already proposed a second proposal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the past few hours, we have completed the initial loss statistics and reorganization plan of the Lenny Army, and the remaining troops will be reorganized into approximately two thousand two The new Lenny Army of thousands. Our plan and budget are here, please vote whether to allocate the budget..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know why, the temporary speaker is somewhat absent-minded and has not raised the question he should raise. Mr. Arnold of the Conservative Party scorned him and stood up and asked: "So, when do we go to crusade the Imperial Remnant, Lord Commander?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Conti? Fox coughed twice and made a statement. At this time, the outside of the Mecash temporary rushed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Commander-in-Chief! The militia alarm station in the north sent a smog signal, and we have already sounded a full-scale alarm! There are a large number of emperors in the direction of Lenny Advance, the staff is presumed to be the majority of the enemy's northern detachment. It is expected that its striker will reach the outside of Lenni within two hours, with a total number exceeding 30,000!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;More than one member of the House of Representatives exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three thousand people?! Where do they come from 30,000?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"North How could the line detachment be so close to Lenny!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fox just nodded and told the lieutenant that he already knew the situation and continued: "In In this emergency, the formation of the new Lenny Army will enlist all the resources of Lenny and the remaining warehouses. I can submit a plan of action and budget to the members, but in this case, I believe you. I understand that this is too late. We must take time to act."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Webster also raised his head and stared at it. Conti Fox, his face seems to have changed a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to invoke Article 3 of the Constitution and propose a motion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Article 3 of the Constitution "Almost all senior members have changed their faces, and those newcomers who have only one or two terms of membership are whispering, wondering what this rarely cited constitutional provision is." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Article 3 of the Constitution." The Provisional Speaker slowly stood up and recited the original text of the article, "When the Union above the Republics meets In times of crisis, you can elect a dictator who will oversee all political, military, and economic affairs of the Union Republic and its independent republics and states, counties, and states."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am proposing here, recommend me, Conti Fox? Commander-in-Chief is the dictator of the Republic of the Congo, governing all political, military, and economic affairs. Please vote."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Honourable Arnold’s double fists are on the table: “I personally fully support you to call the emperor back! But before the final vote, should you submit an independent motion? ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Conti Fox repeated. "I am applying for a standing vote now."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ignored Arnold but stayed on the temporary speaker . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Webster is hesitating. I haven’t waved my raft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snoring of the soldiers outside the parliament has become "Long live the dictator!" and "Return the emperor!". The door seems to understand what it is. Soldiers who have been shaken up are hard to calm down again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Webster is still hesitating, the raft in his hand is shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably disdain for his hesitation, on the side of the Conservative Party, there are already young members who stood up and shouted "Take the empire back!" The senior Conservative MPs also stood up in vain, and only the Federal Party camp was silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, even Mr. Arnold couldn’t help himself, and stood up: "President, do you want to dismiss it, or pass it..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; followed him and stood up again. At this moment, Mr. Webster grew up and knocked down his raft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I trust your judgment, Lieutenant General Fox. Even if you just reorganize the new Rennie Army, you need this permission. This is the last time we have voted for these people. No need to engage in formalism. We will solve it in the simplest way --"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"--Federal people who agree to this proposal, please stand up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Federalists stood up and felt something wrong with the Conservative Party People want to sit down and find that they have missed the opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Webster continued to make a loud conclusion: "According to the standing vote, the number of votes for the provisional assembly has been more than half, and the dictatorship passed! Then, the Republic of the Union In history, the third dictator, Conti Fox, officially took office!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After saying this, Webster slammed heavily and said The raft in the hand lost to Fox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuchs grabbed the raft and skillfully spoke on the floor. This hammer is just on the sound-melting magic array, making a loud noise like a Hong Zhong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers no longer roar, they also heard the sound of this shaking the world. The entire parliament calmed down and quietly heard the sound of a needle falling on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was shaken back half a step, his hand covered his ears, and was shocked by this series of performances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the actors did not pass through in advance, but they actually completed such a complicated political drama! All of this was actually started by his masterpiece proposal...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Fox took the amplification to the maximum and then began to give orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, I am now releasing Conti? Fox as the first order of the dictator. I ordered the immediate dissolution of the sixty-first joint federal republic The Sixty-second Joint Parliament may not be re-created until the republics have regained and re-established the free government."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?! You want to dissolve..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was clearly seen, and Mr. Arnold’s face became pale and there were some Conservative MPs. But no one heard what he was saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And the second order, now begins, all the Freedom Army and the Republican Armed Forces of the Republic of Lennie are incorporated into the New Rennie Army and accepted the reorganization on the spot. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man paused a little and then said the third order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third order, from now on, the new Lenny Army is responsible for covering all unarmed citizens, civilians and former members of the Merticius River. We are always ready Ready to leave Lenny, burn all the materials that can't be taken away before leaving Lenny. The public order ends here, and the troops are ready to accept the command of the New Lenny Army. The end is over."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conservative Party member Arnold suddenly yelled: "The traitor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He jumped onto the table and flew to Fox, tightly Grab the hand he was about to knock on the raft. The door was shocked and stunned, and hurriedly stood up, blocking between the two, and his left hand pressed on the new chapter that he had just received. Fortunately, Mr. Arnold is not crazy enough to commit a crime. He just has to speak to the sound reinforcement circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You disbanded the parliament and gave up Lenny!" The Conservative Party leader screamed exhaustively. "You are not just a dictator, you are a dictator!" You want to end our alliance! You want to end your freedom! Don't listen to his command..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. McCash and the two guards walked across the parliament hall And Arnolda will be brought along with the former temporary speaker, Webster, who has already gone forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door shook his head gently - if there was no action, the Conservative Party leader seemed to be a person who was extremely loyal to freedom. It is this extreme behavior that makes him believe in the judgment of Lord Fox. That must be not only the love of freedom, but also the hatred of your own interests and opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the Fox dictator did not immediately turn off the PA array. He coughed twice and began to answer Arnold's question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Mr. Arnold’s question is not wrong, we have to give up Lenny. This is the first time we have given up Lenny since the establishment of our free nations. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As the commander and temporary commander of the Lenni army, I have to regret to tell you that Lenny is no longer able to defend. The republics of the Republic have to change everything we cherish before everything is irreparable. Before the ashes, Lenny was withdrawn. And we don’t know if we can return. We have lost more than half of Ruslock and half of the Fause, and we are about to lose Lenny, and we may lose more because I will The army will be the back of the people who left. There are still 30,000 people in the emperor. I don't know how many odds I have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the job of almost all professional officers. Judging together, but they did not say it. Even Lieutenant General McCash was surprised to hear this: he felt that this was not something that could be made public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As the third dictator in the history of the Federal Republic, I am here to reinterpret the first order I issued before. Please remember This order is communicated to every citizen of the Republic in the entire civilized world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conti Fox took a deep breath. This sentence is not so good to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this command means that: from now on, the dissolution of the Union Republic will not be rebuilt until we regain the victory." Our military government is only an interim government, and I don't know how long it will take."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers in the square flustered. Until now, they have understood the seriousness of the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the first time in history that we have dissolved the parliament without a second parliament. Even under the rule of the first two dictators, The parliament has not been dissolved. Technically, the history of the Federal Republic has ended temporarily. Since then, there has been no joint province, no federal republic, only free and independent republics. Above them, Except for the Free Army, the Free Navy, and the military government that supported it, which was formed solely for military purposes, there is no higher political entity. If I lose even, we may not even have a dictator."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fox's tone suddenly increased: "But this is not the end, everyone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We used to believe that Everyone should have security and freedom. We used to believe that we are the protectors and pioneers of all human well-being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned from "once" , changed to "future." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we are even more convinced that even if we can't take back Lenny, even if our government and the army are ashamed, even the flags of the free nations will no longer fly, humans. Still willing to fight for the freedom of yourself and others!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was surprised to find that the voice of an old man had such great power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if we give up Lenny, the history of freedom will not end! Even if the Union Council no longer exists, the free people still exist!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the new dictator penetrated the eardrums of all people, and even the emperors in the Southern District were quietly listening to Fox’s speech. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All citizens on land that have not yet been conquered by the Empire and their chosen government have the right to decide whether or not to follow the spirit of the province. All The citizens of the provinces conquered by the empire are free to choose whether they are loyal to the new rulers! I firmly believe that the government of the people, the people, and the people will never perish! The people who inherit this spirit will build more free countries. Let the flag of freedom go on! The victory of the Freedom Army is undecided, but freedom will not fail!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understand why, hear the new dictator honestly People did not feel desperate in the previous failures and unfavorable battles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if the federal parliament has been dissolved, it does not mean that the Freedom and the Provincial Assembly have disappeared together. In the south of Lenny, there is also the Free Intre , Freedom of Meiya, Freedom of the New World, Freedom of the East, and Islands! There are so many still free land that is calling for the people who are hungry for freedom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Even if they heard an unfavorable future, they did not feel desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our ancestors, the Comans once rid the Elf Empire and regained their freedom. They only used the time of two generations of elves, and they did it. A little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our patience should not be lost to our ancestors. After all, our opponents are only human beings, not elves. Former Mr. Arnold, this is my answer to your question - I have not ended my freedom."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hibiscus squats again, and the melody of the tremors trembles, but this time the door does not cover his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All who are or have been citizens of the Republic! All those who do not want to be subjects of the emperor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The squadrons who were sitting in the square stood up and stood up in the same place and respected the military ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All who are unwilling to succumb to those who are under the aristocrats! All who refuse to be slaves!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Near the port of the South Third District, the soldiers of the two armies stopped shooting and listened to this impassioned speech. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Start, go to the land that still has freedom and dignity, start fighting! We did lose the coalition government for the time being, but our cause has not failed! I believe that we will build a new parliament that is better than all previous parliaments - even a brand new country! A better, more free country!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Fox's voice echoed throughout the city, and he was determined to let everyone hear this speech to ensure that Gustav Hugh Coleman did not have any chance to foster a puppet regime. Even if he fosters the puppet regime, he will not gain any heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if you use a month, three months, six months, one year, two years, five years , ten years, good twenty years, fifty years, one hundred years, one thousand years! We have to rebuild a new country! I will let future generations know that there was a group of people. They struggled for their own determination of their own destiny! We all swear under this banner - in the name of freedom, unite forever!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the people stood up, without exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know who it is, gently picking up the first section of the familiar song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forever united in the name of freedom, the great alliance will stand forever..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon hearing this familiar prelude, the remaining members, soldiers, and civilians all began to sing in a subconscious way. In this city, almost everyone will sing this song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Republic of the Union must cross the era, all citizens will be proud of it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They I once laughed at the lyrics of this song, the old tune, and dismissive of it, but now they are singing this song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Long live, our free motherland! It is built from the hands of the people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The gods bless them to unite and freedom! May the four-color cross flag fly for a long time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have repeatedly met to change the song that the song has been out of date, to fill it out The content is more in line with the new era, but they are now singing the original lyrics of this song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We strive to destroy the invading enemy and bring back the victory to the motherland!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We The honor will remain in history, shining with glory and passing on the future!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is getting bigger and bigger. Even if you don't know the illiterate lyrics, you can also sing the national anthem of the Republic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live! Our free motherland! It is built from the hands of the people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The gods bless them to unite and freedom! May the four-color cross flag fly for a long time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the parliament has been dissolved, even if the military government does not have a corresponding parliament, it is free. The spirit still exists in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the four-color cross flag, flutter for a long time! Flying for a long time! Flying for a long time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
