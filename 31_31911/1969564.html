			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xiv<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard; Kakawi quietly walked to the side of the woman he admired . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seamen went to the passenger ship with interest and the sailors automatically gave him and her a space. That is the captain of the sea corps, the real daily manager of the ship, and the "Alchemist of Terror and Destruction" that everyone talks about. No one wants to provoke them. Anne and Bonnie also retired, hiding behind the corner, erecting their ears and eavesdropping on her conversations with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Helmont... Hey, can I call you Reza?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he heard the half-elf, the alchemist who was about to climb into the battle ghost looked back and looked at him with a strange look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I just call you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...well, bud Sha, can you please move it out of that thing first?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call it Ganda." Reza is impatiently coping with the Golem It jumped out inside. "What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's like this... I want to ask you to stay on the ship, okay, Reza?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? Why?" The female alchemist was a bit strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because...the first is that the battle is not difficult and does not require such a strong combat power; the second is..." He hesitated. Do you want to tell your heart? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last emotion defeated reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...you can protect very important things as long as you are on this boat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This emotional love story stirred up a lot of waves in the observers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is it a prelude to confession? This is a good start." The girl with linen hair whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take out the temper, and beat her with a bang!" Annie quietly squeezed her fist and nervously cheered on the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the heroine of this drama has no sense of self-consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? What is it to protect?" Reza's eyebrows pick, "Is it a secret mission? I don't know the goal, there is no way to protect it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Target? Goal...呃..." Can you say that? If her or her two followers are indeed spies...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf has a move and has found a ring from the pocket. "It's okay to protect this for me. It's very important to me. Put it on your hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why save it...? Can't you save it yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the tradition of our Sunshine Navy. If I am killed, I will use it to sign my death notice. I will leave all my legacy to you. If I triumph, you will give it back to me; then, we will have a toast to celebrate." Leonard quickly compiled a "Sanctuary of the Nassen". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing these words, Reza’s eyes trembled a little: “You just didn’t say that this battle is not difficult?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe it's not very difficult..." The half-elf put his left hand on his right chest and took an elf salute in a serious manner. "But I hope that you can bless me to triumph."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, it should be called perfect."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, he asked me before asking questions... In fact, he is not all planning himself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two The girls continue to be in the dark, and they are very unqualified to judge their masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ring is engraved with Leonard; the singular abbreviation of the name of Kikawi, and a family emblem with the eagle as the main motif. The family emblem did not follow heraldicism, did not see the bleeding system, and did not see the inheritance - like most half-elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, I will accept it." Resa smiled and put the ring on her right index finger. "However, I will use my own way to bless you to return home. Close your eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." Is it a kiss? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf holds the fascinating delusion and closes his eyes with pleasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a crisp slap in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf squinted at the left face and looked at the face of the angry face of Reza. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are going to come back alive, don't make up these messy traditions, just as if you really want to die. If there is anything, come back and say it." "Leiza played with the ring on her hand, cold and authentic. "And, you have to be sincere, or else..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that she turned the protruding face of the ring to the palm side, Rainer De scared to spit out his tongue and quickly shifted the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, ok, I know, wait until the end of the battle and say... In addition, I have a small request."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, I want to borrow one of your followers..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liesha’s eyebrows pick a curious expression: “Oh? Anne or Bonnie? Why?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lena De got to her ear and whispered: "Annie is good. I always think they are a bit strange... take them apart, we are all optimistic, just in case. Beware of them..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Less nonsense! You care too much!" Reza was a little angry and sternly refuted him. "However, the set of words you just wrote sounds pretty. For the sake of comfort, lend her to you." After that, Reza walked to the corner and pulled Annie and Bonnie out from there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you two should have heard enough? Now I have to pay interest." She patted Annie's shoulder, "Lenard named Accept your training results, let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" The blonde girl still wants to struggle to resist, but she is pulled up by the half-elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember! You must keep yourself and the safety of my property! Otherwise I will never spare you!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the cry of the alchemist behind him, Leonard smiled and set foot on the deck of the enemy ship with Annie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There, there are no enemies and no hostages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing on the deck except for the seamen who are in front of the stairway leading to the lower deck and the image of the bow that burned to the ashes. The whole boat was terribly quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" Leonard grabbed a captain who was looking at the stairs. "The enemy took the hostage and retired into the cabin. Why didn't you pursue it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man hurriedly argued: "Reporting the sir, someone has been chasing it... but the next batch People, no more come up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing such an excuse, the half-elf is somewhat dissatisfied: "If the battle is fierce, it is normal for no one to come back." Isn't it necessary to create a tension?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the team was stunned and couldn’t speak for a while, but fortunately Anne had solved it for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think, he meant, there was no sound coming from below, this thing is very abnormal." Blonde girl whispered in his ear to remind Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard immediately woke up. Indeed, it is not surprising that there are no enemies, but it is very strange without any sound. He hurriedly asked: "Who is going down?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf frowned, and he knew that the second-team leader was a very good person. If you just stayed with a few miscellaneous soldiers, it is impossible to easily clean up the second detachment...that is, this is likely to be a trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many people are there in your squad?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain immediately replied: "It is also twelve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The battle group, go with me, don't spread out. There should be a very good guy below, the order will be the second team." Leonard issued the order, "the first team guards here, always and The fourth squad guarding the ship will take care of each other! Once any changes occur, immediately ensure the safety of the ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will it be too conservative?" The first team leader raised an objection. "If you also disappeared below, what should we do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard said categorically: "If we don't come back within a quarter of an hour, you will withdraw all of them immediately." The ship, let the captain immediately sailed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard him, everyone immediately followed the order and immediately took the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of blonde girl Anne, she also passed a touch of appreciation: "I can sacrifice for the whole benefit, and I will not abandon my business for private purposes... The volume is really good. The name is not ruined..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of her whispering this sentence is completely different from her usual appearance. It is not like an ordinary merchant lady, not even a bankrupt who is a slave. It was a look of "everything is under control." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie; Miss Sefer, then we are both in a group, you are responsible for covering me behind..." The sound of the half-elf suddenly stopped. That's because when he turned around, he just happened to pick up Anne's look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, what happened? Sorry, I just lost my mind... Is there anything?" When she heard the half-elf, Annie looked up and her face Hanging a little bit of a confused but very brilliant smile in peacetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her brilliant smile, the half-elf really doubts her vision. Perhaps what he just saw is just an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but is that really an illusion...? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, let's go." Leonard turned with a trace of uneasiness and walked down the stairs; Anne followed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it was during the day, the cabin of the "Dano" was also somewhat dim. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a passenger ship restructured by the San Francisco merchant ship, its cabin is much larger than the "Kleon Emperor". The compartments of the first, second and second floors of the original stocks are now separated into white ones into one separate compartment for the residence of the status identities; the compartments of the third and fourth floors are larger and covered with hammocks. Ordinary passenger accommodation. Two corridors running through the bow and tail of the ship connect all the cabins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly tricky." Leonard; Kakawi calculated the manpower at hand, and the area to search for, frowned. "Three people are a group, take care of each other, search for one layer first! If there is something wrong, call immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seamen quickly scatter into the cabin and listen to the sound inside. Carefully searched for a cabin in a cabin. Leonard, Anne and the team leader formed the Pioneer Group and walked in front of the team. The door was kicked open, but nothing was behind. There are no passengers and no enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that they may concentrate the hostages, and then..." The captain looked at the blonde girl and did not continue to say his speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this is unreasonable. If they want to kill, the easiest and quickest way is to push all the hostages down the sea. Why do you want to retreat into the cabin?" De countered. "There is also a possibility that they are delaying the time. They think that their boat will come back, so they will take the hostage to hide..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He slammed open a door and immediately flashed aside to avoid possible attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What appeared in front of him was the body of two sea soldiers. The two died in a terrible state, the wounds are in the domineering, and they are all behind, it seems to be concealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The squadron..." Leonard identified the identity of the deceased and left to examine their bodies. "Two stab wounds are fatal injuries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and the team leader looked at each other and saw each other’s doubts in their eyes. In the small space of the cabin, how can two people be controlled by the people at the same time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie shrunk aside and timidly raised a question: "A combat group, shouldn't it be three people? Is there another one?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seamen who followed up also heard her words. Everyone was a glimpse, and they looked at the people around them with suspicion. No one does not understand the meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard hesitated, or said: "Do not rule out the possibility of traitors...but more evidence is needed. Search for the first layer first. Don't think about it! Don't doubt people near you, this may just be a coincidence!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing the righteous order, he walked out of the hatch and continued searching - but The back rested on the wooden wall. Seeing his movements, the blonde girl had to smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a word called upside down. Soon, everyone also put their backs against the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the solid hull of "Dano" was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, what happened?!" Leonard was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be a shock from the lower cabin..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry up and see ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are the enemies coming up? Are you coming in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carl Ben; the black robe stood at the end of the three-story cabin and calmly asked a pirate beside him. The pirate licked the wound in his left arm and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay...now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man pulled a piece of iron from his arms The small square box was placed underground, and a few steps were taken, and the command to start was whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Through it, random box (boxshapeshif is eighty feet long, thirty feet wide, ten feet high, two fronts are empty!)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he gave the order, the iron box instantly turned into a huge steel passage, slammed into the stern stern and broke into the ship of the Emperor Kleon. Head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirates around are all stunned by the power of this magical item.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You...what are you?" Someone shuddered and asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robe man took off his hood, revealing his pointed ears and white The face: "Of course it is Karben; black robe. But, as you have seen, I serve another, more powerful master. Do you want to follow me?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirates face each other.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black robes continue to sneer and say: "If you can help me with this task, the reward is absolutely Satisfied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... So what are we going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It's very simple. Find a young priest and then kill him.” He pointed to the passage of the black hole. “If you want to get out of the way, come with me now.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to the vibration just now?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza and Bonnie followed a group of sailors and ran to the bow to look down .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is..." Bonnie; Sephiel marveled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resa smiles coldly: "That is a random box that can be freely changed in size and shape, quite a famous high-level magic item. Its value may be better than this The ship's cost is even higher. I didn't expect to see such awesome magic items here... It seems that we are busy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two The woman turned and walked to the side of the golden golem, giving way to the sea soldiers who were coming back from the backboard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ganda! If there are people on the ship who are close, kill innocent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When he heard the command of the alchemist, the golden magic figure slowly stood up and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It...can you identify everyone on this ship?" Bonnie asked in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course." Resa answered with confidence. "Do you think it was on the ship for so long, is it white? As long as it is here, this deck It’s as rock-solid!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown-haired girl spit out her tongue: “He is so smart.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Okay, let's go! Go to the cabin and search for the invaders!" Reza opened a slender pair of legs, with golden afterimages, striding down the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, dear lady!" Bonnie; Seifer followed her. She quietly took out the sword from her waist and held it between her fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a violent vibration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after that, the ship's board under the feet trembled. Leonard; Kikawi took the team and ran down the stairs to the lower deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second level of the luxury cabin looks like the first floor, as if it can also hide many enemies. But the half-elf only stayed here because his sensitive nose smelled the bloody suffocation from the third floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard waved his hand and let the team stop there, and he and the team leader sneaked into the third floor. From the inside of the large cabin, there were several pirate conversations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do military officers want us to stay here? Can the team really come back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The military commander of the great skill said yes, it should be okay. So many elf navies, is it not easy to solve it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak up, What is that? Magic? Or is he ambushing a traitor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf did not say anything, carefully moved to the door and looked inside. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four pirates who are chatting in the hall, and a group of men and women who are shivering in the corner. On the ground, there were many soldiers wearing Sassen uniforms, all falling in a pool of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the last solid expression on their faces, the half-elf can't help but cry. The expression was an extreme, indescribable horror. Most people's wounds seem to be behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly calculated in his mind: the enemy seems to have a mysterious military division... The military division can make people die in extreme shock. That 80% is a magician. He is not here now, but may lead the team back. That is to say...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First hit the hostage here, and then set the ambush!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He waved his hand and gestured to the captain behind him to take everyone down to prepare for the raid. The team leader agreed and sneaked up the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boom! Boom!" At this moment, the hull was another shock, and the ship’s board on the left side of the cabin suddenly broke a big hole, a black one. The shells smashed the hull and went straight into it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help!" The women in the passengers screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the shells were on the boat and the smoke was rising, the half-elf made up their minds. He no longer waited for the backup, and he jumped into it, and the right-handed sword was suddenly squirted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom, come again?!" Another pirate cursed angrily. He just cursed, and the tip of the sword that the half-elf swept back was picked from his face and picked up a long blood mark. The pirate covered his face and screamed; then, the tip of the sword bounced through his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy attack!" The third person responded and hurriedly pulled out the machete in his hand and covered his throat with an arm shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard frowned, the sword tipped and stabbed the other's right wrist. The short scimitar "slammed" and the pirate's throat was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strange...Monster..." The fourth person turned and ran, grabbing a beautiful beauty from the crowd as a hostage. "Don't, don't come over! Lose your weapon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf stunned and stopped. It was a beautiful woman with light green hair, and she looked at the dagger in the throat with a panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Save, save your life! Don't kill me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She screams, the pirate The hand has been shaking all the time, and a slight blood mark has been drawn on her neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Anne and the soldiers of the fourth team came in. When they saw this scene, everyone was taken aback. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go out, go out!" The pirate was very alarmed and held the woman back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard stepped forward and said coldly: "It is useless to take hostages. It is better to surrender, we can spare you a life..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, I don’t know why, the pirates let go of the hostages, their eyes became blood red, and they rushed to him when they yelled! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for death!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Stinger" sword accurately hits the enemy's key . The pirate's face was full of horror, and fell softly to the ground to die. The half-elf glimpsed - this expression he just saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the expression of the dead of the sea soldiers on the ground. He slammed across the softly fallen woman and rushed to the cabin next door to the bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, he saw the huge steel passage, faintly seeing several figures across the passage. He looked at the strange square channel in amazement, wondering if he should go in or not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man in the black robe is also standing opposite the passage, cold and cold swaying the movement here. The two half-elfs looked at each other across the passage connecting the two ships, and no one moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a deafening cannon. Leonard saw through the porthole, and a familiar, black-smoothed gondolier appeared in his field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does...?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge shock caused by the steel tunnel breaking into the ship Of course, it was also passed to the captain of the lower deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened? Immediately confirm, where was the attack?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bow section It seems to be inserted something...can't get out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?! How is this possible..." Captain Ferron heard a watery report, brows It became a tight group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a conspiracy. This is without a doubt a conspiracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret information has been leaked, and he counts. The other party already knows the secret mission of the Emperor Klein... Then he does not have to keep secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baron has a heart and issued the following order: "All sea soldiers and royal guards pay attention! The enemy has penetrated into the ship and immediately protects the pastor Nopp, that is Lord Ferdinand! The rest of the people, defending the lower deck, and ordering!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order was just conveyed, and another sailor ran in flusteredly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
