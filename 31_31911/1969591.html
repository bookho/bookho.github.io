My knights, let me go." The man named His Royal Highness nodded. He wore a pure black dress, an elegant aristocratic dress; in the world of undead, only the lich and the vampire would like the style of the vassal. It can be seen from the pale face that the southern prince is obviously the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First Tax Officer? Sorry, I am only the second..." The reporter asked a little strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vampire "Prince" elegantly replied: "Not long ago, the first tax official unfortunately has been sleeping forever. As a human being, he can become the number of Lenny The tax officer of one is the first time in the history of the organization. Congratulations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new "first tax official" has no smile on his face. "Neon sleep? Is this the reason for the sudden change of the plan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be considered, the goal is to change the target is the king's order." "Prince" said, "Of course Still have to hide our existence as much as possible, so just drag the action of the Lopez Army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still have a question, who killed it? My predecessor? I think we need to be vigilant against that power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prince" picks up a glass filled with blood: "I don't know. It is said to be A vampire hunter, but we don't have any information about her. All of us who are present are dead, including blood servants and pure agents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Is it going to be related to the murder of the bishop of the last month?" "The tax official" asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe. If even the bishops are killed, the knights are unreasonable and can be spared... conveyed, when they see suspicious people, retreat first, don't and unknown The enemy is fighting," the prince ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understanding. Is there anything else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To prevent the enemy from breaking In consideration, we should try our best to use the 'power of the people' to stop the advancement of the Lopez army. Let the knights all move to the place where there are many civilians and dead bodies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Understood, then I quit." The "Tax Officer" bowed and retired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After he left, the vampire prince went to the window and observed the flame that lit the night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you hear the voice of the people, praise the song of selfishness? It is a carol, singing the glory of immortality." Prince sang a poem "I use the power of the people to block the opponent for you, then I will see you, Radz; Gewar. Don't let us down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the blood and messy footprints on the ground, Soledon easily found the main entrance to the Cathedral of Fati. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old and solemn church has completely changed its appearance, and it is full of people everywhere. The mother holding the child, the soldier with the broken arm, the old man who is going to the wood, the businessman who carefully wraps the parcel... The people support each other and send all the wounded people who can be sent nearby. The church is full of blood everywhere. The smell of astringency and the burning flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only few pastors and nuns are already busy with sweat; even so, from time to time, the wounded swallow the last breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for those who are quietly dying in the corner, there is no one to take care of them. There is no funeral, nor a sanctification that gives blessing to the end; only the beautiful goddess of fate observes everything quietly on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's really uncomfortable." The young man snorted, touched the therapeutic potion in his arms, and estimated his remaining magic. Impossible... Even if it is used, it is not enough to treat everyone here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Priest! Pastor!" A few panic shouts caught his attention. “The pastor’s divine power is over-consumed and fainted!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Priest! Pastor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should we do! The healing potion has long been used..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s too far to go to other churches."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A monk walked in front of the statue and prayed earnestly: "Great Futila...please show us those who can't get you right now... What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put his hand into the goddess Like the holy water before. The holy water rippled a ripple, and the monk stared at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton is very curious, he has never seen a scene of praying for gods, unconsciously getting closer. He also has some concerns: Will it be squandered if he uses magic potions here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he didn’t see what was reflected in the water, the monk suddenly turned his head and cheered: “...have...there is a god I got the gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it? What?" Everyone has a hopeful look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as we wait, salvation will come!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait?!" When will it wait? ! How many people can wait here? We are here to die soon! "Some people complained loudly and refuted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs! lady! Cheer up! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The juvenile looks at the sound, seeing the complainant is a housekeeper. His master is a lady, lying on the ground with her broken arm. Her The left hand was cut off entirely - probably for the value ring in her hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, absolutely no one can wait any longer, now is not a concern. In any case, time is life.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton thought so, went over, took out the blue bottle of healing potion from his arms, whispered Road: "Mrs, do you want to use it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steward’s eyes lit up and immediately picked it up. “Too... Thank you so much!” Madam, let's drink it! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the magic potion is very obvious, the blood stops instantly. Although it can not restore the broken arm, at least it can save the worry of life. The butler stood up I gave a very respectful gift to the humble teenager in front of me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you... I don't know how to thank you for the bottle of healing potion. ! If there is an opportunity, we must return! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the grateful smile, Soledon remembered the big men who kicked the wanderers. They would ask them free treatment with anger. The pastor, and will look at the person who can save their lives with respectful eyes... The last hesitation in his heart disappeared without a trace.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole church is squatting When his eyes were focused on him, Soleton took out all 5 bottles of healing potion from his pocket.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These potions, big specials, One bottle of 500 pounds, cash check can be. Of course, the bottle just had to collect money. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audience is screaming. Many people whisper, and some people protest loudly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Is this not clear that it is a danger?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small age, use this snobbery, moral corruption, can only go to hell! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have done this filthy transaction in front of this sacred church!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton was not irritated by these personal attacks, but smiled: "So, according to what you mean, how should these five bottles of medicine be distributed?" What? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it is for the poorest and most injured person!" " Someone answered immediately.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can give them the medicine according to your choice. Why do you have to collect the money?" Someone asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But what kind of qualifications do I have to judge people?" Who is qualified to judge people?" "Or, do you want everyone to share this poor five bottles of potion? Everyone gets a little bit, so that the lips are a little moist, relieve a little paralysis, and sacrifice the other five wounded?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the pastor! The pastor will do his utmost to save others without paying any compensation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The tired pastor is indeed a noble and respectable person. But you only regard him as a cheap servant, isn't it? You don't think about 'needing him to treat yourself' or 'treating yourself Friends and relatives'? Just let you wait, you will be unhappy!" Soledon retorted with a sharp word, "There is no real free lunch in the world! Now, there is more to buy therapeutic potions than money." Is it a fairer way? If so, you can come up!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one ever said even a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only way is to open a high price. Who can afford it, whoever buys it! Whoever doesn't want to buy, whoever continues to suffer! This is not very simple Things? 500 pounds, for a life, not expensive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole church inside and outside, all calm down, leaving only the hard and rapid breathing sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few moments, a few faint voices sounded: "500 pounds, I am out." "Is it not 500 pounds? I recognize it." Life, worth it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton’s expression turned into a smile again. What he didn't know was that at this moment, a beautiful girl who was closely related to his fate was listening to his speech outside the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, she only heard the last sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Whoever can afford it, whoever buys it! Whoever doesn’t want to buy, whoever continues to suffer! Isn’t this a very simple thing? £500, It’s not expensive to change a life!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence attracted Anne’s attention, she slammed the pace of running, secretly leaning on the goddess of fate Outside the cathedral, listen to the movements inside the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"500 pounds, I am out." "Is it not 500 pounds? I recognize it." "Change your life, it's worth it..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These people understand the best interests. Here is the potion, please sign the check or get the gold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing, Annie frowned. "It’s too dark...but maybe he wants to use this money to save other people, maybe he can listen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother! Can you give that bottle of potion to my mother...?" The voice of a little boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does your mother pay 500 pounds? If you pay, then I can sell this potion to you." The guy who sells the potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't...but she is really dying!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Money? So sorry. This bottle of potion is going to give the uncle who paid the money. The voice is still very calm and awkward - but can he use such a sly tone to say such vicious content? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Too jerk, this bastard guy... must make this kind of person's dream of making money bankrupt." Anne's fist huddled together, her sense of justice This kind of person cannot be allowed to exist. She ran to the side of the side and began to prepare the props needed for the action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the old pastor who passed out using the treatment of excessive magic waking up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, respectable pastor, you finally woke up, we can finally be deceived by that guy!" See him wake up and take care of him The nun was happy and said, "You will treat everyone and drive the guy out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's that young boy. I know the dangers of swearing at a young age, and the high price of blackmailing the wounded, there is no sympathy." The nun said disdainfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't hurry, I will persuade him." The old pastor shuddered and stood up. "Where is he?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...in the corner of the ..., next to the mother and the child." The nun took a moment to answer. She kindly reminded: "But you have to pay attention, his eloquence is very good. Many people have been dismissed by him just now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old priest came to the front and just saw Sorelton sing a spell and used magic to make a long white cloth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mage. There is no faith, no moral control." The old pastor thought so, licking his beard, "Look at what he wants next." What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton tore off a white cloth and carefully placed the remaining white cloth on the back of the chair and walked over to the child, whispering : "Little brother, take off your mother's shirt. Brother will give your mother to stop bleeding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy looked at Soledun, I don't know why. The young man is anxious: "I want to give your mother a stop bleeding! Forget it... I will come by myself!" He took off the middle-aged woman's clothes and began to bandage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old pastor was surprised to find that there was a white faint glow gathering on his hands. "Healing magic? Is he a mage who has the magic of healing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager gathers the power of small healing while bandaging the child's mother. Decisive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wound slowly solidified under the influence of magic, and the effectiveness of this healing magic is beyond doubt. The old pastor finally couldn't help but asked: "You... is the mage? Will you use healing magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You also used bandages, have you learned secular medicine?" The priest continued to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton nodded again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should be a mage who believes only in faith, and should not use secular treatments. Why do you treat her with a doctor's method in conjunction with the pastor's method?" Why can you learn healing magic as a mage?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton’s mouth gently rises, whispering: “Treatment magic and healing potions, always It is limited. With the doctor's method, we can save the most people. Now is not the time to stick to the rigid rules and regulations. The woman just because the injury is too heavy, I tried to use the mixed treatment method described in the book to help. She."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And... why are you saving the woman?" The doubts in the old pastor's mind have not been lifted. "Why do you want those people to have so much money, but with so much magic to help a person who can't give you a return?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I don't want others to take me The healing potion and kindness are treated as free lunches that can be trampled at will.” Soledon replied with a smile. “Of course, there is another reason. I am still a kind-hearted boy...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when he said this, there was a disdainful female voice from behind: "If you are kind, there must be no evil boy in the world... Ah, is it you?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice, Soleton vaguely remembers, he turned back a little embarrassed. In any case, being acquainted with such an event is really not very glorious... This voice should be considered an acquaintance. After all, I have seen several faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, he and her once again met. Still in a very bad situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's you...hey, what's your name?" Annie looked at the boy in front of her, grabbed her head and smiled bitterly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is called on the face, like a heavy shell; Solerton unconsciously stepped back two steps. Every boy will imagine that he is different and outstanding, and that he is better than others. "It is the biggest blow to them". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the word "age", Anne's anger rushed up. "I said, you are also a man, do you have such a bonfire, are there any shame?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This has nothing to do with you. You So how can you understand the suffering of the poor when you are born with a golden spoon, and you have a rough and big-skinned lady?" Sorelton’s squinting eyes made the quarrel intensified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Golden spoon is born...? Ha, I will endure more poverty than you." Annie showed her right hand and let the magic mark show it. "Are you even poor, you have never been a slave? The poor must have the minimum ambition, can't do this kind of thing! As long as you work hard, you can develop!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, ambition." The teenager sneered sneerly. "In this world, even being a slave to a rich man is much better than being a poor free man! You dare say that you have not Are you blessed by birth and money? Do you dare to say that your starting point is no higher than others?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." I think I really took the lead with two hundred Fifty years of knowledge and history Returning to this era, Anne could not refute. The people around them also began to whisper in a low voice to discuss the unspeakable relationship between the rich lady and the wandering black boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the other side of the language, the young man pursued. "Have you ever been wandering in the street? Have you ever been blinded by everyone? Have you experienced the sorrow of being a poor man with nothing? If I don't seize every opportunity, how can I get ahead?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie licked her lips and her breathing became a little faster. The boy in front of me... is really like her. That series of rhetorical questions is like telling her own past. Not only do you have nothing, but you don’t see the bottom-level staff where the future is. If there is no such opportunity...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in any case, there should always be something, as the bottom line of selfishness, Anne thought in her heart. Although this is an interference in history... but she must be a bystander, she can't do it. Her morality is not allowed. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "? What's more, there are more than these potions auction with money, more equitable way to do"; & nbsp; & nbsp <br <br /> & nbsp />; &nbsp;When Sorelton said it, she smiled lightly: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne; Seifer's storage from the waist A small box that had already been prepared was pulled out of the pocket. In order to prepare this box of advanced healing potions, she deliberately used flight to rush back to the mansion - and therefore missed the good side of the boy. "As long as everyone can get a therapeutic potion, wouldn't it be?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really a deep blue top-quality healing potion, full of one FCL, enough to have one person and one bottle at the place. In contrast, the bottles that Soledon had before were already completely negligible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who are still watching him and her in the past moment, quietly discussing the topic of "Love Story of Miss Fu Jia and Poor Boy", all press The station got up and stared at the full box of healing potion with hunger and thirst. Some people with lighter injuries are red in their eyes and want to rush forward to get them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry." Annie smiled and called a nun. "Put this off for the injured."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nun asked with a trembling hand after clearing the box of precious healing potions: "Thank you so much. How do you call it?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call me to be a savior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live the Miss Savior!" "Long live the beautiful girl Savior!" Long live the agent of God's grace!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless cheers for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will stay soon. I have more people to save." Anne looked at Soleton with a glance, and then chic Turned around and walked out of the church, continuing to find the object of her "cool, handsome and handsome" in her fantasy. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "I do count, it was just a clown?" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; will lose God to stand in Fiesole Among the surging people, I looked down on the direction of the blonde girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
