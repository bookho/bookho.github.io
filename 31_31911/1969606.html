			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheduled meeting was not held. After experiencing a somewhat difficult wait in an empty conference room in the North Shore Fortress, the secret ambassador from the Holy Coman Empire finally led him to a female captain who was still wearing a military uniform and seemed to have just returned from the outside. Temporary residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corridor of Fortress Fortress is very long. The surrounding blue bricks are dotted with moss, giving off a characteristic taste of a historic building; however, traces of renovation and alteration can be seen from the plaster on the cement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight wearing the humble civilian costume followed the guides into the room, put down the luggage, looked around and gave a soft cold. At first glance, the equipment in this room is quite good, probably compared to two or three gold mark one night superior hotels, the room is also clean as cleaned by the cleaned Intresury housewife - but There are countless little tricks hidden in the decoration of the room. These spy tricks are not a secret to a professional like him. He can see seven out of ten at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walls, windows, and doors of the room are obviously ready for the alarm magic, and two more layers of locks are added, as long as he moves to report to the guards here. Prevent him from contacting the outside world. The candle emits a slightly different bright yellow glow, which is dazzling, and is likely to be used to create illusions or paralyze his nerves. There is a strong scent of lavender floating in the air, undoubtedly to cover up the strange smell that may be released. Although the little magic weapon for monitoring has not been found, the Cavaliers believe that the opponent is already ready. In order to guard against the envoys of a potential enemy, the preparations for the fortress guards are not sufficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, you must stay here for the time being. If you have a need to go out or eat, please ring our guards and the guard will inform the officer to accompany you. You act. Since there may have been Lenny's spies infiltrating our fortress, these measures are for your safety, please understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the captain's epaulettes The beautiful female officer said that the grandiose guest words, but the knight is very clear about the true meaning. He smiled and took counterattacks with his high-profile diplomatic rhetoric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure, I am here to negotiate, not to scout your illusions. I swear by the liberation of the Knights, I will never spy on you. I hope that I can meet with the distinguished Laditz as soon as possible; Marshal Govar meets, after all, communication and understanding can guarantee peace." He pressed his right hand on his left chest and solemnly swears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female officer apparently did not believe his vows. She responded to him with the same false smile and left the room. When the door was lightly closed and the footsteps went away, he relaxed his tight spirit and fell on the bed, looking at the ceiling and let out a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The espionage work is a duel between false and false, a duel between boring and boring - a famous spy who is active in the era of freedom wars The Imperial Security Department left this famous saying. It was only a long time after he became a member of the intelligence department that he understood this sentence. In this era, intelligence personnel are in every corner of the world. Everyone is trying to collect other people's information, and is trying to release false information to deceive others. Every intelligence officer struggles in the ever-changing intelligence ocean, trying to get the best solution, but there is always no answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, work still has to be done..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is in his mind Speak to himself and consider the next move. The name he publicly uses is Vasor; Rasta, the sergeant is the squad leader of the Liberation Knights; but his secret position is the second-class secret agent of the Ministry of Security. Of course, as the sacred empire security minister Sid; Naser's love, the purpose of his coming here is of course not only the negotiation work - but also an important liaison work. An exceptionally important and urgent liaison work will be related to the future direction of the entire Southern strategy. That person's contact code is "brume eagle"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing to consider is just how to contact. The Cavaliers know that this is a bit difficult, but I believe that it will not be a very difficult problem. If your opponent limits your actions somewhere, just avoid this place and take action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now? Rasta Rasta hesitated and decided to sleep now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gendarmerie captain, Thain; Major Constance slowly pointed his lap with his commanding stalk with a gold head, and the more than a dozen eunuchs present felt a little chilling. The eyes of middle-aged people are more gloomy and serious than usual. He only lowered his temperature in the room by his gaze. Nanny; Lieutenant Soledon stood at the forefront of the team and secretly licked his tongue: he sometimes felt that Major Sain should not be an officer, but should be a banker, factory owner or similar capitalist. It is easy to deter subordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the knight sent by the Empire is undoubtedly a spell user, so I still have to rely on you and these priests and pastors to beware of him. I never believe This person is only coming as a secret agent. He must also shoulder the important task of spying on the allocation, intelligence, and logistics of our army. Because of his subtle identity, we can never get rid of him: the only way is to not let He gets any valuable intelligence. At any time, you have to make sure that at least two people are performing his task of monitoring him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His identity is subtle? What is it?" Someone asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" is the illegitimate child of an empire's dignitary. In a sense, his identity is equivalent to an empire's endorsement of their sincerity. If he is If we have something wrong here, we will give the empire the best excuse for the war.” Cheyenne waved the baton in his hand and stressed, “You must stop him from getting intelligence, and if possible, give him false information best. You are careless about this task, I will not hesitate to send you to the military court."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow!" A dozen right hands are lifted neatly, accompanied by A thorny response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the term of the military court was heard, the magicians and pastors who were temporarily transferred from the various companies were sneaked. Sain; Major Constance had the nickname "Devil's Auxiliary Officer" when he served as the deputy officer of the Ministry of the Gentlemen in the Ministry of Staff. He was never forgiven and never praised the entire Free Army. Regrettably, the former moderate gendarmerie captain died on the night of the 7th, and the entire coup, or the military and anti-espionage departments of the government, fell into the hands of the devil. This is really a disaster for the savage fortress guards. The General Staff has been stationed in the fortress for only two weeks. The forbidden area in the bottom of the fortress has been filled with soldiers who have violated the small military discipline. As for the heavy increase in the cursed midnight whistle and long-distance patrol as punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing everyone’s promise was very happy, Major Sain nodded with satisfaction and nodded: “Then, the shift schedule starts with the ranks, and then the ensign and the quasi-尉Naimen; Lieutenant Soledon is responsible for copying and dispatching the shift schedule, and all disbanded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is secretly crying in the heart, from the hands of the chief Received the list. This shift list includes almost all of the eunuch-level wizards. There are many classes such as "Midnight from midnight to midnight" and "Midnight from four o'clock to eight o'clock in the morning". Although it is not as defensive as the guards, it is also necessary to stay in the dark and wet surveillance room and other magical alarms. He glanced slightly and saw the first group of shifts "four to eight o'clock" and wrote the name of Captain Itis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the eye-catching ensigns also came to this arrangement, and some dissatisfied protests: "Why can the lieutenant of this department arrange dinner classes with beautiful women, and still do it every day?" And we are going to shrink in the cold and damp central surveillance room at midnight, staring at the magic crystal ball?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this protest, resistance The door smiled a bit, and there was no interface for fun. He had long known that almost all the military mages had a very big opinion on his triumphant and direct promotion to the lieutenant at the headquarters, but it was only because of the military rank, military regulations and the power of the headquarters. As long as they catch the opportunity, they will never be afraid to attack him. Although among the soldiers, he has a small prestige by luck; but among his peers, he has not received any good comments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you question this arrangement? Then I explain it to you." The pole swung up and pointed at the tip of the lieutenant. "The reason why The strongest and most experienced group is arranged during the dinner period because the responsibility for this period is the most important. After dinner, it is the most lax and chaotic time of the police. Most of the espionage activities are selected during this period. For example, just look at the number of masts in the port at dinner, you can estimate the exact strength of the fleet - because the ship that sailed at this time has the least number of ships, and depending on the amount of food consumed or the number of people eating in the cafeteria, Accurately estimate the strength and organization of our army. What's more, during this time period, the target can go out reasonably and reasonably, we must prepare the experienced and powerful anti-spyware personnel to follow. Among you, the most suitable for this task is Two officers of the headquarters. If you think you can beat them, you can volunteer yourself; but never let me find out. No."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe I will be killed by the magic from behind." The teenager said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frasol; Rasta Rasta has been sleeping until he starts to feel a little pain before he gets up from the bed. After a good night's sleep, he felt that the fatigue was slightly eliminated. Estimating the time, he guessed that the "Fog Eagle" should have prepared several sets of methods to hand over the information to him, and decided to start the action. After finishing the clothes and finding the basin to wash the face, Rasta gently pulled the bell rope on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s already half past five, I want to taste the food of Fort Fort, please report it to your boss.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the two sentinels sprinted away and left another one in place. The Viscount knew that he could not bring someone back within half an hour, and he took out a collection of legends from his inner bag and began to read; and another guard at the door looked at him like an enemy. The Viscount smiled and gave the cover of the book to him; but the guard was still staring at him with great vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is really not a secret intelligence or a mantra... Oh, sorry, are you illiterate?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard this question, the guards were stunned and turned around with their spears. Frasol had to drop the book, lay back on the bed, and stared at the ceiling. Already put on a dry clothes, the female captain who had hidden the body curve arrived only twenty minutes later, accompanied by a young lieutenant who had no impression of him and looks very mediocre - the Viscount estimated that he should be an officer of the gendarmerie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry to keep you waiting." As soon as the female captain entered the house, she squatted in accordance with the Imperial etiquette. "We should be a little faster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to apologize, you are coming faster than I expected." Frasol got up from the bed and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then let's go now? We have already booked the most exclusive folk restaurant in Fort Vatican for you. The history of this restaurant can be traced back to your country. The era of not building a city again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Frasol picked up his legendary story and handed it to the humble young lieutenant," By the way, your guards seem to be very vigilant about reading books. Should this book be okay? I don't want to be bored here for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistance The door took the book, browsed it again, and felt that there was no problem, so I went back: "I think this book should be no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount took over Book, thrown back to the bed: "So let's go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itisla opened the door and made a gesture of please: "Please come with me. I am afraid that the hotel has not received aristocrats for decades, and your visit will definitely make them shine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; In fact, this may not be the case... Frasal; Rasta recalls the great achievements of the nobles who have infiltrated the fortress in the fortress decades ago, while walking along the depths of the corridor with Itis and Nanimen go with. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people on the road have a chat without a chat, talking about unimportant topics, and testing each other's abilities and identities. They all know that the other person can use magic, but they don't know the exact school and ability segments of each other. However, the Viscount Rasta was surprised to find that he did not see the accommodation area or the cafeteria along the way, nor did he see the soldiers who gathered for dinner, let alone the masts in the port - so he guessed the other two. There should be a wizard with a fairly good illusion level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when he really saw the location of the restaurant, he was still taken aback and was very happy in his heart. The restaurant was actually located on a small mound, hollowed out on all sides, and the sea breeze blew it, and when you eat inside, you can directly look at the entire bay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The location of this restaurant is really good, overlooking the entire estuary. I have heard that the mouth of the Mt. Bixi River is spectacular. I was very excited to see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis smiled: "If you come to Fort Vatican, you can’t see it. Haikou, I am afraid it will affect our bilateral relations. I can't afford this responsibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The viscount will understand each other after sitting in the restaurant. The source of that very confident smile. Inside the vast harbor, there are only two solitary warships! At that moment, he felt that his face had changed a little, and he was somewhat "flattered" about his "excellent treatment." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
