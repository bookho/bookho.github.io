There are quite a few thieves with badges in our guild."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just claiming to have a badge, it will be magic, who knows it is true. Can you borrow their badge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Is this magic? It’s just that anyone can see things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not so difficult. Anyone can learn magic with their heart..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a "skin", but the female thief who was very petite was laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We don't even know the word. Can you learn magic without knowing the word?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I don't know if I can't see it. I know that... in... In the end, some people can use magic without literacy. As long as they master the method, they have a firm will, and they can see without literacy. The power of magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The code name is "Silver Plate" is a somewhat reserved yellow-skinned woman, she also has no good impression of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That said, even if you can magic, you can't go out. This cell is full of magic, you are not taking them. No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know where to come from, and I shook my head decisively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is...not necessarily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see through simple intuition The weakness of the magic on the wall is as clear as its builder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, that is probably the device used to throw prisoners... there is only a wall of organs."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of meditation, the wall collapsed in front of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because faith is power," such a sentence comes to mind, "So change the reality."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence seems to emerge from the depths of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as this is -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hands put it on the wall and whisper in your mind ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stunned thing happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire wall is separated in front of the palm of your hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people bounced off the ground and looked incredulously at the sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the sun, you can see the sea, cross the front wall, not far from the beach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Jade Ring" was called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of a few people, the broken wall is slowly repairing itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark, there seems to be eyes to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This, I am afraid this place can no longer be used..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They made a short Screaming, stumbled and rushed out, even the shoes ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally looked back and looked at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of the retina is the lighthouse standing in the sunset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thursday, October 20, 1606<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase Port Extra Large Supply Ship "Xiyang"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One and another warships followed the diversion vessel into the port Area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The port of Phase Port can park hundreds of ships. The terminal can load and unload dozens of ships at the same time, but it must accept such a huge force as the Seventh Fleet. Still have to make every effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it was past midnight, the entire dock was brightly lit. Countless family flags are hunted and fluttered in the night wind, and the dinghy of the transporter is flying through the port area and dexterously drilled through the gaps of the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On several occasions, Major Neremon Soledon felt that he would be involved in a water collision. He secretly prepared an underwater breathing exercise in his left hand and prayed that the subtropical sea in late autumn would not be too cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but nothing happened. The paddler of the dinghy slowly stopped and patted the side of the target vessel with the paddle in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The winch is full! The rope ladder will be put down immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailors on the deck Shouting. There is a winch on the boat that can pull the boat up, but all the winches are now full, and seven or eight boats are coming here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is indeed a mountain-like giant ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major looked up and sighed, looking A large heavy artillery supply ship in front of this four-deck deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flagship of the Seventh Fleet is a free-class special battleship named "Broken Wave" with three decks and 100 artillery and magic cannons. "It is nearly twice as big as it is." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge hull created by Lingyangmen using oriental technology, combined with the multiple vertical sail system that the Intres are good at, formed this giant . Moored in the calm harbor, there is almost no sway in the hull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be no seasickness for such guests, but it is a good place to hold a banquet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The door climbed up the rope ladder, and his two guards followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of music coming out of the porthole rushed into the ear. The four-story artillery deck was all taken out as a venue for the banquet, and each floor also had a musician who was responsible for the atmosphere. With the music literacy that is almost equal to no one, he can barely hear the euphony of the Eastern Empire, the flute of the Taiping religion, the violin and the music of the Couman style, and There is a sprite soprano with an elf. The music came out through the porthole, and there was a strange flavor when it was mixed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This can't be just ready. Maybe when the advance fleet arrives in the morning, it's all started. It's the Seventh Fleet." ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Major of the Independent Gendarmerie, Lord N. Soleton."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he did not need to introduce himself. Even if some people don't know the red uniform with only one side sleeves, the two medals of excellence are enough to identify him. The heroes of Jena and Lenny, the new star of the Free Army, the representative of the new regime in the Republic of Intre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Welcome, the Warlord makes you. The commander of the fleet is already at the banquet venue, sorry that he can't come to meet you personally."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was arbitrarily waved: "Know it, let me go. There are still a lot of boats in the queue, I will not delay your time..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes someone suddenly slammed him from behind and used the wrong rank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shangyu? Is it the door to the door?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorsteps are slamming . This kind of familiar feeling, the feeling of full of vitality and slamming is not the first time -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A slap on his side. The appearance of Metty Crosso is always so direct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, you! Aha, have you transferred to Interry? How did the emblem on the epaulette change, and was promoted?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is probably the only person on the ship who doesn't know her new position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two guards near him were caught off guard, and they were on the sword, but they didn’t know what to do. The "raiker" thinks that it is a petite girl who is not threatened... One of them comes from "strong operation" and he recognizes the identity of the attacker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, is that the lady responsible for air defense?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes It’s her.” Endurance smiled. “You should go down and eat first. I will arrive later. Since I am at the site of the Seventh Fleet, I don’t need any guards.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The two guards are a little hesitant: "Sir, this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, this is the order." The door waved impatiently. Was the hand that was entangled in Metty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two guards glanced at each other, nodded tacitly, and whispered and hurried into the cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door dragged Metty to the side of the ship and began to cope with this difficult little demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was appointed Army Major in the Port of Continent, Intercontinental Commander."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The major." Metty released her hand and pulled her finger to start calculating the class. "The officer you are rising does not seem to be so high. Is there no problem in this occasion? I saw a lot of navy just below. Major General, Lieutenant General, and a few Admirals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door has to explain another sentence: "This is... in Interlake In all the official army units of the Republic, except for the Second Freedom Division, I am the highest. The Second Division and the entire Intercontinental Army are in Fort Vatican."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Meddy's chin clicked: "That is, you are now a big man? It doesn't look like it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's right, Missy. Are you here to play?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid. Do you look like an organ here?" Metty disdainfully One "A little common sense is good! This time I attended as a social representative of the Crosso family, not to play!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really don't want to be big by you. Miss said so. Naimeng lamented in his heart, but did not dare to say this sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crosso's house?" The door smiled. He had done some homework on the boat for the past few weeks. "Crosso Brothers Bank Tension is not a day or two. Lenny’s loss in the past few days will not even be discounted... In the phase port? If your father or your uncle came, it might be better.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door sighed: "Do you dare to throw the business of the phase port to you? This is too bold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been able to do A qualified female companion is okay?” Metty mentioned the long skirt of the evening gown and dexterously turned around. “To speak social, I should be more comfortable than you.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chest is indeed a little bigger than the last time I saw it, and the height seems to have grown a little higher... but there is only one point, and I think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A qualified female companion would not be so self-proclaimed," he said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meddy asked: "Have you already a female companion? Well, is Anne? Is she not your adjutant?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the door became gloomy and the corners of the eyes were clearly smashed. He subconsciously touched the necklace he had with his chest, and the sapphire that contained all his meaning of existence was still there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meti should not know the situation, he said to himself. Fortunately, it is now outside the cabin, the expression on his face should not scare people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She...has another appointment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is stopped and caught The subtext of Metty's words changed the topic bluntly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, there is still a guardian responsible for the phase port business. Is it your father or uncle?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the summary of the door-to-door theme, Metty slammed a "beep" from his nose and turned and ran away. The door shook his head and was about to catch up. Another female voice stopped him coldly from the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are looking for her guardian, that's me. I haven't seen Metty who has been bullying my family for a few months, eh?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound that was inserted this time is a bit strange to Nanimen. It was not until he saw the long blond hair until his waist that he remembered who the master of the voice was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Reesa, long time no see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lesa Hermonte in a gold The Chinese clothes are still very dazzling under the dim lighting. The iconic giant battle demon did not follow her, and the door was able to find out how high she was: the female alchemist in front of him was half a head higher than him. If he stood between the ladies and the ladies, It is as conspicuous as an ogre standing in a group of goblins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information collected by the 27 merchants collected before and the glamorous figure in front of the eyes, the young officers suddenly realized what. Pure gold comprehensive trade... no. The house opened next door to his small clothing store, Mr. Zalte...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door tempted and asked: "Since you are here, that pure gold Integrated trade must be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alchemist nodded: "Yes. Integrated trade, magic industry, shipping, insurance companies... and banks. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone who asked the door, said that the pure gold business is a miracle. When the fifth free war was in full swing, the company built a twenty-seventh lighthouse in the phase port, and it was the latest lighthouse to be expanded in fifteen years, announcing the upstart of this outbreak in Interlake The status of the countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your underwear store has really become a big deal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the phase The best alchemist in Hong Kong, Reza Hermonte, makes money just like taking a bag. "Lisa proudly boasted two words. "However, the youth of the year became a well-known big man in the free countries. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What big man. Just think of the task I want to accomplish, the cold sweat behind it can come out at any time. People like me can really shoulder so much "Responsibility?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not the same as what you said to my family Metty." Reza chuckled. "Don't say that, Solerton Just as the gods want me to be the best alchemist in the world, the task you accept is what the gods expect of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bonnie Seifer can't be separated in Faures, but she has already contacted me. I will cooperate with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is fierce The ground is enlarged. What he should have thought of: the one responsible for protecting Anne's spare body, of course, is the pure gold consortium. He grabbed Resa's wrist and asked nervously: "When can we go? Now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not so anxious, the place is foolproof, Anne My own designed lighthouse defense, only she can pass, even I can not reach the depths of the building. Since you brought it, then we can go in..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to go." Nana, holding the necklace on his chest, said with a slap in the face, "She personally entrusted me, I will do it myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, newcomers are reporting their identity to the sailors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The commander of the narrow sea submarine fleet, Lieutenant General Leonard Kikawi." "Please go here, sir."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing these conversations, Leisha speeded up the speech: "I will talk about it first. After landing, go to 'Pure Gold' and we will talk about the next step. Now the time is not enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door nodded and turned and was about to leave, and almost hit the newcomer who had just stepped onto the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Warlord makes you. Well, and Ms. Hermonte, I haven't seen you for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The half-elf Leonard Kikawi made a slight salute. He wore a full-length navy lieutenant's gown, and he wore a beautifully decorated piercing sword at his waist, and he looked like a heroic figure under the magic crystal light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are welcome, Lieutenant General. Our previous business cooperation is very enjoyable. I hope that you will be able to cooperate with you after you transfer to Port." The words of the words were suddenly elegant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf looked around and saw only the door-to-door, Reza and Metty, who looked at the sea from afar, a little confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have been here for a long time, why not go in. Did the party not officially start?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Reach explained: "The banquet has already begun, but the atmosphere is slightly stiff. Since the ceasefire, the big men in the phase port have gathered together like this for the first time. There are a lot of troubles. I don't want to participate in this occasion. Then, it will come out and breathe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is a bitter smile and inserted: "Can you run a huge consortium like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no need for me to operate personally." Reza shrugged. "We are behind the Protestant Archbishops of the Protestant retreats. It is enough to let the following managers do it." Is there anything that needs 'the pure gold alchemist' to go out in person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Leonard Kikawi said with a serious face. "For example, tell the two people who have just arrived at the phase port to talk about the customs here. By the way, let me talk about socializing. The inner wind and the water started to provoke the unhappy character of our lady."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resa smiled and naturally took Leonard’s arm "Well, you did come up with a task that requires the 'golden alchemist' to go out in person. Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is stunned. I feel deeply lack of experience. He now understands why he will "catch up" on the deck to Reza and Metty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed and walked behind the cabin with the two men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just two steps away, Metty caught up and took his left arm and could not allow him to refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is down the stairs, but around Not as noisy and stuffy as he imagined. The sea breeze blows in from the position of the porthole of the gun door, and there is still a slight smell of sulfur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large main artillery deck was cleared and used as the main venue for the banquet. The furnishings in the venue are a bit strange, like a combination of Eastern and Western styles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, most people are not listening to music and are not sitting and eating. They all have female companions, carrying wines from different countries, walking around and talking to each other frequently. The local dignitaries who were invited from the phase port were brought with their ladies, sisters or daughters. The Eastern Fleet of the Seventh Fleet also took their family members. Some people also took more than one according to the habits of the Eastern Empire. Naimen quickly glanced at the scene for a week and did not find Wei Taiping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Commander of the Narrow Sea Fleet, Leonard Kikawi and Miss Reza Hermonte! And..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The welcome clerk at the door wanted to sign his name, and he was so busy that he stopped him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorlayton, are you going to wait and see the situation first? This is fine, let me introduce you to those who have already come." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving Leonard’s arm, Reza picked up a cup of pure gold Russell’s noble rot from the wine table, and the half elf followed for a cup. Mix whiskey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two-family of the phase port is a general term. In fact, there are many families that are not family. Some of the founders of the lighthouse have also fallen. Some guilds or parliaments are funded and managed. There are indeed a few of them that can be traced back to the independence period, but most of them are upstarts like us. Most people are still willing to recognize the authority of the central government. Responsible authorities can make a statement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rum of the door is robbed from Metty, he forced the beautiful girl player Changed a cup of ice milk. Listening to the introduction of the family of the chaebols, she secretly recorded the aspects of the family wealth and its competitive advantages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Double Excellence and Unisex Military Uniforms...that is the first door of Lenny's Warrior Soleton?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that he has overwhelming the magic of the imperial emperor and the Grand Duke, and also the military minister of the empire..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some The man recognized him and whispered a whisper about his legend, but he was afraid that his reputation would not come forward. Resist the door to make a smile, but did not take the initiative to go to talk. There are a lot of naval officers in the field, they are obviously more keen to talk with the various merchants - after all, the Seventh Fleet itself is the biggest luxury merchant on this route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the number of generals was less than what was expected by Nintendo. Probably because the dinner has not yet officially started, the door is not only not seeing the Marshal Wei Taiping, nor the commander of the main sub-fleet. Most of the talks with the guests are the navy responsible for guard, tactics and logistics. General. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After skipping the Navy general, Reza began to introduce the magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magical world of Phase Harbor is also very complicated. You know that the city is divided into Westport, built by our Comans, and the eastern state established by the Taoists. The two parts of the city. Although the main port is on the west side, there is also a small port in the east. Fortunately, our reputation is better than that of the infamous elf, and it is more reliable than the illusory empire, which guarantees the safety of the phase port... ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The main source of income for the offshore fleet is indeed private, which is also an open secret." Leonard Kikawi smiled bitterly, "Of course Now, I am already on the side of anti-privateness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they chat, Naomi pays attention to a group of people in the corner. He frowned slightly, and carefully walked in that direction with wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the crowd who used a serious expression and sitting on several round tables, he seemed to see the familiar figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These tables are the bishops of the Interre Pact and the female director of the Intralux provincial capital..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resa quickly chased it up and whispered in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all the new faculties, these two great men are also dressed in plain white robes, with a simple silver line emblem. Of course, the degree of fabric, sewing craftsmanship or personal fit is very impressive, and it will never be a bargain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The First Eastern Bishop of the Elven Church..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these three big men stood and looked at each other seriously with several male and female priests dressed in Orthodox costumes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As for the few who are standing...is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The language plug did not recognize the color of the standing person. Instead, the door was serious and he whispered to himself and answered the question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't that the nuns of those empire? But the men...when did they have men? And, the nun, how do you think... ...all..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A name that cannot be said here. In fact, even if it is said that there are probably few people who believe in it, because there are few people in the South who have seen this person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are two here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meddy Crowseau also stunned, and walked carefully to his side and asked: "The man looks a bit like Oria..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘘." Ningmen stared at the lips of the black-haired nun. "I think you should have not guessed."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what makes him even more dangerous is the person standing in front of Olivia. It was a strong, handsome and handsome silver priest who looked very elegant, but there was a dangerous feeling in the smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Deaf is the Cardinal of Ionette Hartman, the Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Envoy of the Archdiocese of the Grand Duchy of Interstate. I am the Pontifical His Majesty brought a sacred greeting to the Intercontinental Church and the Sun Apostolic League."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter from the silver-haired man who claimed to be the ambassador’s envoy Put it on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chairman of the Principal Diocese of the Grand Duchy of Inter-Thunder, Rif Namlock, Bishop of the Confucius of the Confucius."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the Orthodox Church cleric who once again has a Cardinal level in this position after a lapse of one hundred years. Whether it is the Eastern First Bishop of the Elven Church or the dignitaries of the two new churches, it seems very troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female secretary of the provincial capital picked up a greeting letter and frowned. Her tone is full of doubt and distrust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Northern Church has not appointed a Pontifical Envoy for many years...and, the female bishop?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"If you doubt, this is the sacred appointment of my sister and the Namlock. The number of Orthodox people around the narrow sea is rising, and we cannot separate them from the gospel of the patriarch." Br /> /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette Hartmann has found two documents flashing the divine light, "We want to rebuild the Archdiocese of the Grand Duchy of Interstate, It is also to tell you that the Orthodox and the Grand Duke Church have been very different from a hundred years ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old church called reform? I am interested in coming. Hearing, there is any conspiracy in the imperial pope's envoys. The bishop of the Covenant also snorted and returned to his position to sit up and sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf finally spoke up, but it helped Ionite: "If it’s just a patriarchal envoy, you are not qualified to refuse. You are not the same in the north. There are missionaries..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a few priests in the opportunity to argue in the doctrine, Nami and Metty looked at each other and reached a tacit understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them, under the pseudonym "Riv Namlock", did not notice themselves, and quickly stepped back to the deck. The other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meti nervously asked: "Do you think she saw it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I saw it and didn't seem to..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door grabbed the head and glanced at the direction of the religious person, which coincided with Olivia’s gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olivia Hugh Coleman was a glimpse first, then suddenly smiled and turned to talk to others. Her smile made the door to a cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephan pulled Metty and immediately found a table to sit down and kept breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drank the wine in his hand and wanted to ease his nervousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meddy has been pulling his sleeves: "So, Soledon... We sat in the table of the people."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Daomin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metti whispered quickly: "Murray people, that is, the Taipings. They call themselves' The Taoist 'or 'the winner'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until then, the doorkeeper noticed that the guests at the nearby tables were different from the rest of the table. These people are sitting together, but they don't look like couples or men and women. Orientals with yellow skin and Westerners with white skin. They all sat seriously in front of the empty round table, not chatting, nor drinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people all wear a uniform yellow headscarf, dressed in a wide and comfortable robes, and draw a wonderful symbol in the corners of the robes with short lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people sitting on the right side are also white and yellow, dressed like the people on the left, but subtly different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some men wearing nothing, others wearing yellow headscarves, the style is different from those on the left, women are mostly tied with yellow ribbons. hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the table where the door is sitting, there is a young beauty with a yellow ribbon tied with a single ponytail, staring at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She dresses completely east, but has white skin and unforgettable honey-colored long hair, the same oriental girl's pale yellow skin, black The long hair is completely different, and it is obviously mixed with the blood of the Koman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like most of the mixed-race children, she has the delicate skin of the Orientals, the handsome body of the Koman, and the amazing mixed beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door whispered wiped the sweat and asked: "Excuse me, I haven’t disturbed you?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." The mixed-race replied succinctly, "Since the guest has started eating and drinking, we should not wait for the host again. Open the meal, you, it is impolite to let the guests eat and drink alone. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following the order, handsome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around him replied at the same time, the sound is neat Naimen was taken a little surprised. The actions of these people are as neat as an elite force. Nanimen does not know how many company members in his gendarmerie can do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they didn’t start eating right away, but they changed into the Eastern language and started to recite a magical spell like the inexplicable words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The road is very good, very famous; the name can be named, very famous. Daocheng everything, Suihua Sanqing, Tianren one, three in one..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They prayed before the meal." Metty hurriedly explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Praying... is the creed?" The door was frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Protestantism has not used the creed, but he still knows how to use the short generalization to spread the orthodox faith. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As early as the end of the Elves of the Elves, the orthodox sects compiled their beliefs into concise "creeds" for the believers to spread. By the time of the split of the Orthodox Protestantism, the two sides reopened the creed as an important weapon to distinguish between the enemy and the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the "Covenant" and "Contract" have their own creeds, and the priests of the gods also have their own set. The Elves' Sun God Creed accommodates them. Things like "three grids", "six hexagrams", and "twelve shapes" can not be read by ordinary people. In addition to pastors who rely on the creeds to use magical techniques, there are no ordinary believers who carry these creeds. . In front of these people, they looked at the clerics, but they were so skilled in the confession that they were a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meddi shook his head: "I don't know. I don't know Taiping, I don't know Oriental Mandarin..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timing of the stop is still so uniform, just like they are waiting for another table to finish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The sky is dead, the yellow sky is standing, the age is in the armor, the world is good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Naimen has already guessed the next development. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, just as the "Daji" two words have not been scattered, the two tables of the door are also open at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...For the sake of heaven and earth, to make a living for the people, to go to school, to open the peace for the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Clade Lopez’s oriental history told him when he was free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The Taoist faction is very complicated, but it can be divided by the formation period and the region. Staying in the Eastern Empire, and advocating compromise with the secular emperor is ' The Shangqing 'and 'Zhengyi', and the radicals who advocated that the sky is higher than the Son of Heaven, are collectively referred to as the Taiping Road. Among them, the factions that were reneged during the Elven Empire were called 'Tai Ping Zong', and in the Second World War of Koman The faction is called 'Dongqu Zong'. Because the Taiping and Hengqu doctrines emphasize the word Taiping very much, outsiders usually refer to them as 'Tai Pingjiao', but in fact these two are pure Taoism at home, one Advocating Confucianism and Taoism is really incompetent..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he bowed his head, the female leader of the table turned to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although we are invited guests, since you are sitting with our female companion and us, it is the fate of the avenue for us. "The mixed-race girl smiled. "Although we probably guessed it, can you ask your guest for your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The door is resistant. Leiden Freedom Major. "The eyebrows of the door are almost twisted together, trying to reflect on their third-rate knowledge of the Oriental common language. "Can you ask your lady for your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; This sentence was only exported, and the faces of the surrounding people suddenly changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing! Is the name you can ask?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hybrid Beauty" Giggle, two laughs: "It doesn't matter, I don't know who is not guilty. It is reasonable to say that the name of the Eastern woman can't tell you these 'innocents', but since it is the hero of the Intrepid, Jena and Lenny. Ask me if I don't answer, there may be awkwardness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the door is red: "Sorry... I don't know you very well. Customs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Zhang Shiyi. At the time of time, the wing of the wing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hybrid The girl said a heroic name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is silent, and the origin of these two words is searched from memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it really can’t remember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed his head and leaned his elbows on the table, secretly holding Annie’s memory and looking up after a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the time is guaranteed, the wing of the child is also from 'nail nails'. Are you a direct descendant of the first sacred sacred?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time I was shocked by the mixed-race girl Zhang Shiyi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you read our books? You said that you are a pro-disciple of Luo Taihao, it seems to be true..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, another voice rang behind the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Several friends, I see there is still a vacancy here. I wonder if I can accept a Orthodox singer?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the door becomes blue-white. He can immediately hear this voice -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the voice of the first Princess of the Empire, Olia Hugh Coleman! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to shed cold sweat on his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
