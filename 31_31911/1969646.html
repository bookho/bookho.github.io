			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xx<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior awakened from her dream for the third time. She didn't expect that just a few minutes of conversation would make her so uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first dream, she lived in the imperial princess, but lived a lonely life, and finally escaped from the night to escape the magnificent cage but in the moat. The guarded monster dragged into the bottom of the water to suffocate. In the second dream, she killed all the people who knew the secret, set fire to the palace, and hanged the aristocrat who was the queen but was rebelled. In the third dream, the real thing appeared in front of her eyes, she was placed in the underground cell waiting for the dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is helping her in that dream, she can only face the ultimate fate alone. In a foreign country, the pursuit of goals is extremely difficult, people around can not trust, people who can be trusted are not around ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of this, the girl suddenly hit A greeting. "Isn't this my father's life in the East?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has been reluctant to talk to her father, but now the words are actually in my ear. In a foreign country where no language can be trusted and no one can trust, her father actually stayed for more than ten years, and even found a head in that society... Thinking of it, she could no longer sleep, sit up and put on her clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is already in the middle of the night, and the moonlight is good outside. Yanika pushed the door out and walked down the hallway of the inner house to the yard. The temporary Marshal’s house was set up next to the original Freedom Command, and the inner guards were almost all removed according to the order of Marshal Govar. She could not find anyone to chat - no, even if she could find someone, she also It is impossible to talk to them about the real thoughts in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Sorelton is here, the army he stayed in seems to have not been eliminated, not far from here." The real idea is only There was a flash in my mind, and a dissatisfaction with no reason rushed to the heart of 黛妮卡. "The guy has always been in the Free Army. Anne has always been with him. They are sure to be able to talk to each other about their dissatisfaction and worry at any time. This is really amazing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly stopped here. What is she thinking about? envy? Hey? dissatisfied? No, she already knows these things for several months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...is afraid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yenica is next to the fountain in the middle of the yard Sit down and look at the door not far away. There were two guards who were dozing off the door, and they didn't notice it. The hidden door is very attractive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you push it away and find a reason to escape, no one will ever find her. Everything here will be irrelevant to her... She can go back to Lenny, go back to the welfare home, listen to the news of the men fighting, and live a leisurely and determined life. There will be no threat of death and no uncertain future. The only uncertainty may be who she will marry. She doesn't have to be scared, she doesn't have to maintain a false identity for twelve hours or more every day, and she doesn't have to improve her magical ability day and night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yenica’s fingers unconsciously circled the pool, causing waves of ripples. She doesn't have to be involved in this quagmire, isn't it? It’s still too late to get out of the way...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“哗啦”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden heavy water falling from the pool behind it, like a monster suddenly rushing out of the fountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl jumped in horror and turned to stare at the pool with vigilance. What is inside is not a monster, but a young man who is wet and wet. His age does not seem to be more than 30 years old. His appearance is quite handsome. His hair was scattered on his face, his clothes were all wet, and he looked very embarrassed. He seems to have put away some kind of magic, and the light on his body has disappeared, but there are still a few filaments that emit silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is the Kengal Governorate of the Ministry of Military Affairs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the maid dressed up Yanika, the man jumped out of the pool as soon as he lifted his legs, gathered the hair attached to his face, and stood on the edge of the granite pool and asked blankly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the Marshal House. Are you?" Renee took two steps back and quietly glanced at the guard at the door. They also heard the movement here and are coming here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am an imperial messenger. I must let you forget when I come here. Sorry. Take me to see Govar, maid, right away. Don't panic, don't alarm anyone, I won't hurt you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These hypnotic magics were silent, accurate, and quick, and they left a deep impression on Yanika. She also noticed why he didn't raise his left hand: the man's left hand was gone, and his left wrist was covered with thick sleeves. She immediately understood that her magic was against the imperial messenger in front of her. He would not hesitate to hypnotize her and let her forget all of this... After that, he would naturally not be able to see Marshal Govar. She also vaguely guessed the identity of this person: he was injured, exhausted, and arrogant, but he could not conceal the habitual calmness and the temptation to command others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t show a trace of panic, just stepped back two steps and asked: “Do you mind if I hide it here? Or are you going? Is there a room for anti-reconnaissance magic in the mansion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man’s eyes flashed a glimpse of the incomprehensible surprise and nodded. Yanika smiled slightly and smashed the spell of "anti-detection" magic in case the other party would be wrong. After finishing all this, she pressed her chest and bowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Ministry of Security Southern Bureau Agent Seneca sees the Minister. Please come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; What she did not expect was that this sentence actually made the young man with a cold face like a big enemy. He jerked back one step and stepped into the pool without knowing it. He even read a few spells in ten seconds, and his look turned a little shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible. I should have got rid of it. Impossible. Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yinica only heard this sentence vaguely, and he felt that his body was numb, and the space around him was distorted. The blue-and-white phosphorescence surrounds the man's body and looks like a kind of protection; thousands of eyes are suspended by him, as if to see everything around him, and see through her inside and outside. Seeing such a powerful magic, Yanika is more and more sure that the person in front of him is the Minister of Security himself. She didn't know what her image looked like in that magic, but she still felt shy and annoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the end of this embarrassing "authentication" is as sudden and rapid as its beginning. The man quickly put away all the magic, and Renika seemed to see him sigh of relief, as if he smiled slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry." A vocabulary that was inconsistent with his image was sent to Renee. "I am too nervous. I am indeed the Minister of Security, Sid. Nass, can you tell me your name again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Junika; Lopez." The girl did not hesitate to say herself. Full name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard gently snorted when she heard her last name. "I remember. Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 pressed the panic in his heart, took Sid to the reception room, and walked quickly toward the marshal. Bedroom. There are also no guards at the door, only a few alert spells that require a password, and she reads those passwords to open the door. After quickly changing into the marshal uniform, she became Ladz again; Govar, still in doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one question left in her heart. What kind of opponent is it that can make Sid and Nasser warn to such a point? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn't expect to get an answer, she has to hide this question in her heart. After taking a deep breath, she pushed the door of the meeting room again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first time I met, the Secretary of the Security, long-awaited." She lowered her gaze and looked at Sid's expression with the corner of her eye. He seems to know nothing about the patterns they play... but is it really like this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Security is writing something, and when she comes in, she hides the piece of paper with a finger. "You don't have to be a guest. The situation is urgent. Please call all your own people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deland received the urgent report from Sid in half an hour. Ironically, this is much earlier than the time when Rennie got the news of the riots in Kengal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid used the means of communication representing the highest emergency to send the report to all the embassies of the emperor. Every apprentice who was responsible for maintaining the equipment was stunned by a cold sweat, transcribed his communication in a random order, and asked the guards to send them to the dignitaries who should hear the report. Each report will be copied three times to ensure that no cabinet minister will miss the meeting. Even the emperor himself had to get up from the bed and rushed to the cabinet meeting room to discuss the emergency report that was enough to dispel everyone's sleepiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frasol is a git! What the hell is he doing? He will make such a dangerous plan! Lord Newton is a cardinal. This is the empire for centuries, no, the shame that has never been seen in five hundred years! If he dares to come back... No, your Majesty, please withdraw his position. This guy lost his hand and was captured last time. This time he made such a big mistake, he really did not forgive him any more reason!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Military Affairs, Duke Loren von Figota, shot Sid’s report on the table, his face flushed and screaming in an angry tone. Everyone here knows that Rasta is his illegitimate child, and he knows that he is pleading for him. Gustav was undecided about this. The squad was the Prime Minister of von Chalinburg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The words can't be said, the Viscount Rasta has tried his best. He is the first time to truly stand alone, and this performance is beyond us. The expectation. With 2,000 people defeating 7,000 people, even if the overseas army has rarely won such a large scale against the indigenous people, it is very tactical to organize the manpower to counterattack. The sacrifice of Jeter; Newton is probably because The enemy is unexpectedly tenacious, not the commander’s plan error.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court advisor, the Victor of the Platinum emblem, echoes: “The Prime Minister’s account is exactly what Nanfang has always been good at developing all kinds of strange magic items to make up for their lack of spells. Maybe Newton is in the middle of a trap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't expect Yes, this statement angered the court priest. Archbishop Ingrid looked cold and taught in an older female teacher's tone: "I can't think of any traps that can be counted to Jeter. You are welcome to say that if you don't want to choose to die, no one is here. Can put him to death - not to mention the five or six masters in the South. Unless they have a magical breakthrough, it is impossible to kill a cardinal with the gods."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her statement gave everyone a glimpse. As a representative of the Holy See, Ingrid has never clearly stated its position as it is now. Even the Prime Minister and the Military Minister can't figure out what she really wants to do. Everyone knows that no one in the history of the Cardinal has been killed because they have the gods to protect them, but they are far enough away from the battlefield - the number of priests in the same rank is quite a lot. Feng; Chalinburg coughed twice and tried to ask: "So, the Archbishop means...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We must send enough high-order The pastor is going to investigate this matter. The lead of theology is related to our survival. This matter must go all out. The pope has already seen the omen, and he will bless the actions we will make.” Ingrid said with a sigh . She had already received news from the Divination Department of the Holy See and had a vague understanding of what was going to happen recently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咔嗒", Gustav’s scepter “power” fell to the ground. The emperor stood up fiercely and held the table with his hands. He asked: "Has the Holy See already seen the omen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. As long as there is no more than destiny With the intervention of power, we will march towards victory in this holy war. The gods will bless this war!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Chancellor of the Exchequer Mosley; Everyone is surprised. In the last two wars, the blessings of the Holy See were vague and indefinite, and they never saw the victory that would never come. But this time, the Holy See is not only supporting them in the war, but also vows to say that the Empire will win! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jihad! Will this be a holy war?" Foreign Secretary Ke Wei; Hugh; the Eagle Wing excited to stand up and walked around the table two times. Can't conceal the excitement in the tone: "Let them come! If the South wants war, we will give them war!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the atheist Gresin’s mouth Oh, I seem to want to say something, but I hold back. This expression has not passed the foreign minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Morris, what do you think? Do you have to say that the national budget is not enough? Not enough to add war tax! This should not be what you are best at. What?!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Intres Adventurer took the pipe and took a deep breath, squinting at the Earl of the Eagle Wing. "I don't have much opinion about religion. Just if there is a dispute over the war tax on the nobility, will Eagle Wing go to communicate with them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ...Do you not collect war taxes from territorial jurisdictions, municipalities and businessmen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unfortunately, businessmen, artisans and farmers are all legged. The empire can't vote by hand, but they can vote with their feet. Taxation in the territory of the emperor's direct jurisdiction will only make those Grand Duchy happy." Gresham turned to Gustav and asked with respect, "Your Majesty can tell me that you intend How many troops are you using?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Morris's mental calculation, he answered: "The 150,000 people, the supply line is farthest to Lenny, nine months. The tax will be paid for next year, plus four months. This time to solve, otherwise it can only issue unsecured government bonds. And the military banknotes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did we have been working hard to reform the finances for so many years, only this savings? In the same year, Leo Stein took two hundred thousand people to fight three In the year, only 30 million gold marks were used. "There is also some doubt about this number. He thinks that the cost is too high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Interlakes grinned: "This is no longer the era of sword and knighthood, Lord Prime Minister. Modern warfare is money! 50,000 cavalry, ten The Wan Bubing is not touched by the mouth, but it is not the arrow that is drawn on the map. Everyone has fifty gold coins per year. What kind of jokes? To organize the army, it is necessary to have a corresponding army. The logistics structure, administrative structure, and command structure are indispensable. What should the equipment do? How to do the logistics? How to deal with the collection? Now two hundred gold coins per person per year are not enough! Yes, the last war, Leostein only used 30 million Gold coins, so he was defeated by the Southerners with money!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing here, the Earl of Eagles couldn’t stand it anymore and jumped out of his seat. "You, the Southern Skull, dare to smear the emperor! Where are so many military squads? I am afraid it is convenient for you to embezzle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The embe is inevitable. But I can say that I have not taken away even a copper from inside. If it can really eliminate the phenomenon of embezzlement, the military can at least an extra one-third. But who is embezzling, I think everyone here is probably clearer than me. More."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris's tone is still not serious, but there is more than one person quietly bowing his head, including the Gustav emperor himself. Everyone knows that every officer of the emperor lives on the grounds of exploiting military expenses. This elite rank of officers is basically composed of the non-heirs of the bankrupt aristocrats and the aristocratic family. It is far superior to the southern militia corps, but unable to maintain the arranging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the situation is already the case, we can't sit back and watch. Spring can't be a bad combat season, right? Total mobilization."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gustav stood up from the table and broke the cold field and finalized the final resolution. Feng; Prime Minister Chalinburg stood up and wanted to stop, but Gustav did not give him this opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Send all the Dukes. Within two days, the Second, Third, Fifth and First in the West Section of Newcastle and Oslo The second Fergota army must complete the offensive preparation. Tell the new Duke of Soma, let him mobilize the second Soma army, the first army is still responsible for the Western border garrison. The follow-up force mobilization plan will be handed over to you, Figota Qing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the order." The military minister stood up and replied firmly according to his left chest. "I will try to mobilize the largest number of troops to keep up." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gustav thought about it and ordered the name of the Chancellor of the Exchequer: "Grey Xinqing, I want 250,000."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"250,000? What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want you to maintain 250,000 in the South, Only by the end of this year. The emperor is only five-fifths of the standing force. The cost is not important. If necessary, you can borrow from the tax for the next ten years. Can you do it?”<br /> <br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power is illuminated, and its golden glow is reflected on the table. This moment of Gustav; Hugh; Coman, it seems difficult to defy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, 210,000 people are capped. 90,000 people in the direction of Royal Mile and Steele, 70,000 in the direction of Figota, Soma direction 50,000 people.” Morris; Gresham hesitated and cut off one-fifth of the request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to hear an excuse. Two thousand people, plus two troops and 40,000 people to be the general reserve team. Also, we can't give up the West Confucianism. Locke, the force of the Royal Mile was transferred to Soma. The West Road was the main attack, maintaining 90,000 people from the Soma Principality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...If you leave you If I insist, I will try my best.” The Minister of Finance paused and remembered one thing. “If it is not possible, perhaps we can learn from the Kengals and set up a family, aristocrats and subjects. The co-owned central bank issued banknotes to sort out the finances."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young emperor nodded with satisfaction: "These are good to say, financially, please Coordinated with the General Command, it is important to ensure the supply of the army. I will be handed over to you. I trust you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't need a gallows, please give me a logistical supply."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gustav screamed at the "power" and left the cabinet meeting without returning room. The emperor seemed to see the road to the free country open, just at his feet. The last word he dropped decided the ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dissemination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge war machine of the empire ran in six hours. First of all, it is DeLand's headquarters, then its subordinate logistics agencies, intelligence agencies, communication agencies, and then the various departments, propaganda departments, external and internal negotiations. The determination to start the war spread to all the people of Koman through hundreds of gatherings, demonstrations and speeches. Thousands of mobilizations were held in all levels of the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royal Army General Command has been working on a day-to-night battle plan to put the first batch of 80,000 emperors into the Ruhrlock front. The Royal Second Army Pioneer, which had already been prepared, crossed the border line after 72 hours, crossed the Tianshou River, and set off to meet the Coleman Army trapped in Jules. All the troops will be mobilized within five days and will cross the border in all within ten days. On April 1, 1668, the Holy Coman Empire will be fully mobilized. On the mobilization schedule, its record is “May Day”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the fifth and final free war broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four-color cross flag is still flying over the camp outside Kengal. This flag has been flying here for two nights, and is now welcoming its third morning. In the past two days and nights, the sound of guns and gunshots under the city has hardly been stopped. Every two or three hours, the emperor will organize a large-scale shelling, so that the defenders of the entire fortress will not be able to rest. I don't know why, the emperor's siege has some work and no effort. When the gun is fired, there are fewer attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even, in the past two days they have lost nearly half of their troops: one company has surrendered to the enemy, three companies have left without a word, and the horses have lost their lives. Even the scattered soldiers are enough to fill a company; in contrast, the emperor has lost more than thirty bodies. Since the sixth "Metebexi" division of the government government has not participated in the battle, the strength of the two armies is actually similar. It is not worth boasting to make such a record. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in this early morning, the routine shelling of the imperial confinement outside the city was suspended, and there were no signs of siege or sneak attack. The temporary commander of the defender had been sleeping comfortably until nine o'clock before being awakened by a gentle female voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lieutenant Soleilton, get up. Everyone is waiting for you. I know that you have worked hard for the past two days, but now it is not a time to sleep. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sonyka, let me sleep for a while..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stumbled over, whispered to the man and slept. It was followed by a gentle coldness, followed by a deafening metal crash that slammed in the ear. His first reaction was that the emperor had come in. He even rolled down the bed and rolled down the bed. He touched the pistol from the military uniform on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back and saw his beautiful girl adjutant standing on the bed with his face, I don’t know why it looked very unpleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That... Anne? What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing, call you to get up "Yes." Annie shrugged if she had nothing to do, hiding something in her cuffs. Although it was only a glimpse, the door was sure that it was not the size that would fit into the cuff. She is really angry - the juvenile is so judged. He wore his uniform and shook the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just said that everyone is waiting for me? What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" There is good news.” Anne’s tone was slightly more excited. “The emperor has retreated!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Retreat?! Really?” Resist the door to stop the hand that was buttoning, and asked with surprise, "Is it realized that it is impossible to solve everything by force?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their gun The reconnaissance units have confirmed that the temporary camp of the other party is empty. There is no trace of fire." Annie must nod. "I think, Hull’s man has finally arrived. However, there are already three or four. The company commanders took the team to attack the enemy on their own. These guys saw that they had the merits and they jumped better than anyone else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know. This major decision is not expected to be decided by the frontline officers. I know that you have always wanted to leave the active service to go to the higher army college, but still don't have much hope."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But anyway, this is a good thing, right?" Hearing the enemy retreat, the door was still excited and shivering. Even if the shield commander is not recognized by anyone, even if there is no talent for command, he will finally support the arrival of the reinforcements...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne took a shot His shoulders. "It's time to go, Sorelton, it's too late to attack again. Are you willing to let those guys who are hiding behind in the defensive war take the credit away?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Even if you are not willing to do it. After all, you still have to fight side by side with them, aren't you?" The door was spread out. "I really want credit, but the credit is enough for me to leave the active service. Anyway, like me." It is very difficult for a person to become a general. What do you do with so much credit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? This..." Hearing this is not aggressive The heart’s speech, Anne could not think of how to answer. "There is more credit, better than less."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who knows." Nana shrugged. "Don't talk about this topic, or start." Let’s see Lieutenant Colonel Tedwood earlier. It’s not our mission to defend here.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two arrived at the main entrance of the camp and gathered there. force. Anne left behind a few eunuch defensive players who were not willing to accept the command of the door, and took the rest of the troops to follow the traces left by the other side. The route of the other party's retreat was to go south along the west of Kangle, to join their main force, and to throw them all over the road, and even some artificially destroyed artillery. They did not encounter traps, nor did they encounter other troops chasing them in front, until Kengal’s West Gate appeared in the field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look! There is no flag on the gate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know which scouting cavalry first discovered Alien in the city. Nanimen and Annie rushed to the front of the team and found that the top of the city gate was indeed bare. There was no green cross flag hanging from the government, and there was no flag of the Free Army. There wasn't a guard at the gate, but there were dozens of corpses in blue military coats lying on the sidelines; the pungent smell of smoke ran straight into the nostrils, and the unpleasant blood and bullets scattered around. Looking into the broken city gate, there was no one on the street in the city, just as quiet as the night after the martial law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Her's people have fought here?" Annie asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was carefully approached by a corpse, and he looked at his rank and collar and shook his head. "No, these are the people who oversee the government. Are they also joining the emperor? If this is true, the situation is a bit tricky. The question now is, in which direction are they going? The footprints around this battlefield and The ruts are too messy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne thought about it, the right hand swayed and said to everyone: "Quiet!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ordered wherever she went, and she was silent. The blonde girl whispered a curse, closed her eyes, raised her head, raised her toes, and placed her right hand on her ear, just like listening to something. She trembled on her toes and slowly and slowly turned her body three times, eventually stopping in one direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a crossfire five kilometers away from this direction. I think we have to hurry up, otherwise the few companies that chase it out will probably not hold it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go." Resist the door and whip, commanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne is busy calling him: "Wait a minute, Soledon. This may be a trap, are we really going to?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Going. Although they are acting arbitrarily, I am responsible for them." Nanimen nodded heavily. "I don't want to abandon any friendly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they arrived there, they saw something completely unexpected. The four companies that are struggling to go beyond chasing are actually two or three groups! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unit relied on the King River and a mound near the ramp to form a position, supported by about twice the number of enemy attacks. On both sides of the team, there are countless flags consisting of three green bars and an azure background. The few faces of "Trenches" and "Iron Grey Cross" are almost invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
