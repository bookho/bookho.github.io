			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xvi<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first person told the second person, "An Amazon River Rainforest The butterfly in the occasion, occasionally flapping a few wings, may cause a storm in Texas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second person told the third person, "In the Amazon River There is a butterfly in the basin, and occasionally fanning a few wings will cause a large storm called 'Texas.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third person told the fourth Personally, "There is a butterfly called the Amazon, which only struggles to flap the wings in a large storm. It determines whether the storm will continue or stop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth person told the fifth person, “When the storm comes, there will be a butterfly called Amazon. It always waves its wings to eliminate the storm.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp As such, the accumulation of small changes will result in a huge deviation of the results. This magical effect is commonly referred to as the butterfly effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people meet with each other, conspiracy and design entangle each other, and in the end it becomes a result that no one can predict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History cannot be estimated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you? How come here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apprentice Pastor Nopp is only nervous After a while, it calmed down. He took out a silver dagger from his arms and pointed at the black robe man in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person who will end your life." Machiavelli in the black robe replied with a smile. "Mr. Ferdinand...or, the future Duke of Soma."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this reply, the Lord’s hand shook: "Which side are you? People? My distant brother, the Earl of Meissen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is a general bard story, the plot will be like this: evil Other heirs, in order to seize the big position, set up a conspiracy, hired a killer to kill the orthodox heirs! Yes, this is very understandable, too understandable, too good to imagine, haha... for a three generations who have been exiled in the New World The old aristocrats of the South can only think of this possibility?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the other person’s laughter and ridicule are heard, the expression on the Lord’s face is stretched. It’s getting tighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Machiavelli’s tone turned: “But unfortunately, I didn’t get any benefit from them. Or, you can say that, I am with you. There is no fundamental interest between my country and your country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression on Lord’s face changed, and asked strangely : "That... why do you have to spend so much time and set up such a huge trap to murder me?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? Even your protagonist, Don't know the reason for the drama?" Machiavelli smiled scornfully, not in a hurry, as if everything was in his grasp. "Then, you should always know why you can inherit the Soma Principality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the blood of the Duke of Soma is about to break. Among my family of the Southern nobility, I have the direct bloodline of the Duke of Soma. My mother is the young lady of the former Duke of Soma." It is known that the call for help is useless, and the Lord is also patient, a little answer. The question of the Secretary of State for the Second State. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That was a political marriage - everyone thought that in the third free war, the Holy Empire could restore the South." Machiavelli referred to "the sacred In the empire, there was a trace of disdain in his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Freedom of War? Is it a recovery war?" Lord carefully corrected the name used by the other party. The nationals of the Republic of the Union said that the war between the South and the North was a free war; the nationals of the Holy Empire claimed that the war between the two sides was a war of recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, yes, for the exiled former southern aristocracy, nature is a war of recovery." Machiavelli continued to sneer, "Then, you too You should know that there are two other inheritance rights and people who are almost equal to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, that's it. We have three candidates. The first person, if he is allowed to inherit, then all the nobles will be chaotic - no matter which big aristocrat, there is a constant blood relationship with the royal family. If the emperor can In this opportunity to claim inheritance rights, then he can ask for the inheritance rights of any nobles. The nobles will never agree that this person inherits the huge Soma Principality - of course, the elves will not agree."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Machiavelli said a convincing analysis, and the Lord nodded and seemed to understand the complex entanglements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The second person, Earl Meisson, sounds good. But he has two questions: First, he is a devout Protestant, advocating North and South Second, he is the heir to the Principality of Noel, and his wife is a pure blood elf. These two points, no matter which point, the Imperial Court, the Holy See, the Magic Arbitration Association will never agree - can let this person inherit the northwest The party of the Principality of Noor is enough to be dissatisfied. Can he still inherit a Soma Principality?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Ferdinand clap his hands: "Yes... Therefore, in the case that the emperor and aristocratic empire of the empire are absolutely unable to accept the inheritance of the other party, they have to push me to the front desk, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You say That's right.” Nikolay; Machiavelli’s tone of appreciation reveals, “You are not afraid of danger, and the political sense of smell is very good. It is indeed a material of a natural aristocrat. Unfortunately, you must die here.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you haven't said Since you are not sent by the Earl of Meissen, who did you send it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So let me introduce myself. I am Nigu. Lama; Machiavelli, the second secretary of state of the Republic of the Jury. Is this clear enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the name, the Lord was shocked: "South The traitor...!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, this is not very nice. After all, the Soma Principality you originally wanted to inherit can be relied entirely on Our battle has only been upgraded to its current status. Originally, Soma was at the end of the nine major public domestic rankings, and now it is the second largest Grand Duchy by relying on trade between the North and the South. Our province is also indispensable."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But... Why does the province want my life?" Lord was still puzzled. "I inherited the Soma Principality and will not suddenly become an enemy of the province..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this question, Machiavelli’s expression suddenly changed. The score is serious. He cleared his throat and said, "That is to create some trouble between the emperor and the aristocracy. If you inherit, the emperor and the aristocrats can form an alliance again. This is something we can't accept." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But is such a bold decision not too dangerous? In case someone is bringing fire to your head..." Lord Ferdinand is keenly Point out the flaws in his scheme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we can only see this choice. Gustav; Hugh; Coman, he is terrible. He is what I have imagined. The perfect emperor - he is powerful, wise and courageous, kind to the people, cruel to the enemy. He uses the hand of others to carry out tyranny and spreads favors with his own hands." When talking about the emperor's majesty, even Machiavelli's I also did not consciously bring respect in the tone. "If we can't guarantee that we are invulnerable, we will only confuse the enemy. Now, can you die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this question, Lord Ferdinand Tightened the silver dagger in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I ask the last question?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excuse me." Machiavelli The face is still hung with a tight expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Ferdinand smiled and said: "Why are you delaying the time? When did you find it wrong?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone is watching, it will be shocked by the dramatic changes in his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shivering and cowardly emotions he just showed were completely lost in a single sentence. Now, he is already a confident, winning person. It will never be the expression and momentum that an exiled former southern aristocrat should have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Machiavelli’s black robe trembled, and the prepared attack magic had come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there are people on the ship who are close, kill innocent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden Devil Like Ganda, with his eyes looking around, looking for all the close unknown people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, there is a big man here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It looks pretty good... Let me deal with it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognize. Two strange humans with a headscarf on their heads and a machete in their hands. Memory comparison, no coincidence. Not the person on board. Kill innocent people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yellow; Gold; Fly; Boxing." The Golden Devil struggled to read someone's gorgeous name for the move, lifted the giant palm, and banged it. Hit out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy who rushed up with a scimitar flew out of the ship's side, leaving a beautiful parabola and splash into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This guy is amazing! Everyone besieged him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wearing gold armor, worth a lot Money! Kill him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identify interrupts. being attacked. Self-defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yellow; Gold; Lie; Broken." The Golden Devil is like a right hand, and a long blade of the arm pops out from the wrist, mammoth to one of the pirates. . The pirate picked up the wooden shield to resist, but the shield split in half, and he immediately died under the knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirate next to "I am fighting with you!" shouted, and the scimitar in his hand went to the seam of the Golden Golem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yellow; Gold; One; Refers." The Golden Devil stretched out with his left hand, a palm of his hand, grabbed the knife and handed it back to its owner. Body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strange, monster! Not a person!" The pirates finally recognized the facts and immediately turned away; but Ganda’s self-defense was not over yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the enemy is going to escape, you will kill them with the strongest tricks!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This It seems to be the knowledge that I learned at the beginning. The Golden Golem nodded slightly and knew what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yellow; Gold; Body; Test." The golden shoulders of the shoulders are instantly opened, and twenty simple bows that have been filled are appearing. Seeing this scene, all the faces of the pirates have changed color; even those who are slow, know that this thing is a man-made item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom...this metamorphosis, who made it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唰唰唰! The gorgeous 20 gold arrowes are simultaneously shot from the shoulders of the Golden Golem, and the pirates are cruelly nailed to the deck; the end of each golden arrow is connected with a thin reinforced spider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing people who haven’t attacked themselves, they raise their right hand and start the internal winch. The winch is very powerful, and the fortified spiders are dragged back with a little arrow - those who have been shot and who have not died, are immediately screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, this thing must be a vain, and also a stupid guy made... I understand, it is a woman!" After calling the conclusion, he broke his breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No enemies. Ganda saw that there were a lot of people who were dead or dying on the ground and decided to check if they were the people on board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After checking the second one, I was in trouble: the seriously injured person was full of blood. Its artificially inferior artificial soul can't tell which side of the person it is. If you think about it, you decide to step on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the owner said this: "A man who is useless, you can step on it as you like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Wait, wait! I am a friend, a four-team, can't step on me!" Seeing the heavy big feet is going to the abdomen, the injured seaman hurriedly yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deck of the "Kleon Emperor" was filled with screaming. Whether it is a pirate or a sea soldier, the injured people shouted: "I am a sea corps!" "I am a friend!" "I am innocent!"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since they are all friends, they can’t kill. Ganda looked around and wanted to see if there were any enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the guys across the deck didn’t seem to have seen it...the guy was holding a strange long metal weapon and was confronting a half-elf that was familiar with it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is far from that person. The Golem thought about it and decided to use a long-range weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yellow; Gold; Big; Cannon." According to the usual practice of reading the name of the line, it knees down on the left knee, open the door of the right leg knee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the bang of "Boom", Jin Hao’s only weapon that was not golden was launched. It was a 3-pound shell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shell flew in the wind and flew to the two who had been there for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment when the gun popped up, Leonard and Katzmi understood that it was time to decide the outcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this destructive balance primer too big?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a bit big But there is no time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the sea corps exchanged a look with the pirate leader. Almost at the same time, the two long-term powers were released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kezmi held his breath, his eyes flashed, and the knife in his hand went from the top right to the left and left! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry!" This thought flashed through the half-elf mind. Leonard can only see the opponent's wrist shaking, but can't see the knife's blade - this knife is almost so fast! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t know what’s going on, and after a long while, he slammed back and slammed his body, and he flashed the knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but still not fast enough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This knife still smashed the smock of his chest, and cut the leather armor inside, and made a striking huge crack on the leather. Not waiting for him to retreat again, the pirate captain has followed another step forward, the knife slashed an arc in the air, and cut it from the opposite direction to the half-elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a critical moment, Leonard launched the magical attributes hidden on his weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Defense Mode!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, outside the blade of the sword in his hand, Covered with a touch of sea blue light. "The Defender's Elf Sword" shows its true body. This weapon can form a "blade shield" in a very short range to resist the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handle of Leonard’s hand trembled, and the tip of the wizard’s sword was woven into a flexible defense net on the right side of his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time as the blade shield is formed, the blade has approached him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard smiled scornfully, and as the blue light flashed, the sword tip seemed to be impossible to accurately hit the blade of the samurai sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed is instantly suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A strong force reached Kazmi’s hand, he was unsteady, and the samurai sword rebelled uncontrollably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the two times when the two men played in the same way, the shells were already flying. Leonard used the force on the other side of the knife to retreat and jumped off the flight path of the shell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind cut!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of shells, Kazmi does not hide, bullets Standing in the air, turning 180 degrees in the air, the samurai sword that started the hidden ability flew straight down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard still had no time to marvel at the speed of the knife. The shells had been smashed in half and flew out to the back of the pirate captain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unstoppable blade slammed into the ship's slab, and there was a huge roar of the ship behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...vacuum damage? This knife is strong! Attack mode!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lena De gently pressed the hilt, and the blue light shrouded outside the sword suddenly turned red. The knife that glared at the other side had not been lifted again, and the half-elf stepped forward and attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp sword that flashed red light was exceptionally stable and accurate, and did not tremble toward the other's throat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirate captain smiled quietly, the samurai sword suddenly raised, the right hand loosened, the left hand reversed, changed to a thorn, straight to Leonard’s atrium . "Retreat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thorn is completely out of Leonard's expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vacuum blade extends over the extension of the blade, straight to the heart of the half-elf. As a tried and tested warrior, he immediately estimated the speed of the thorn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That, even faster than the previous one! Although it is late, it must be first! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen the heart piercing the tip of his heart. The ominous premonition is to be fulfilled...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the knife tip is wrong seems to have become very long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard knows that there is no second person on board to block this pirate. He must win - at least, drag the enemy to the bottomless hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, Reza. There may be no chance to confess to you." Faced with the spurred tip, the half-elf calmly moved forward. A step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accuracy will be above everything else, above speed, strength, and life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the opponent’s knife runs through his heart, his sword will not be stabbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be the scene that the lurking enemy is most happy to see at the side? He thought so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far from the battlefield of the two men, the blonde girl Anne; Seifer is holding the green-haired woman who was once hostage. The two women are chatting happily, as if they were not at all on the battlefield - women are always able to find topics anytime, anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maggie, Lily; Maggie, fortune teller." With a light green long hair, a gorgeous woman with a ponytail introduces herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, Anne; Seifer. Fortune teller? I can't see it at all!" Hearing the fortune teller, Anne; Seifer excited. No matter how she looks, she is not like a secret that is hidden. "Do you use the guardian constellation for fortune telling? I have never seen a fortune telling with a constellation for many years! My guardian constellation is the magical goddess Bella!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggie Smiled: "Oh, that... I don't need a constellation fortune telling, I use birthday flowers for fortune telling. How many days is your birthday?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today is me Birthday. So, I especially want to find someone to count my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today, that’s really fabulous... June 12th, it’s the battlefield. The flower language is 'like the feelings of poetry'. Anne is definitely a person who likes to dream of romanticism? Is it special perfectionism, I want to have a destined prince?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde girl stunned. "Like... it’s all in the middle. Good! Then what is the birthday of my birthday today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today's fortune...ah!!! It's not saved. My gentleman?" The green-haired woman suddenly stopped and looked at the place where Leonard and Katzmi fought. "Come on! Kill him! Kill him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" Annie turned her head and saw Leonard walking towards the tip of the knife. A step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
