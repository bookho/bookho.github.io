			<div id="content">VII<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Nermen Soledon breathes air mixed with bloody and rancid smells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint gray smog is filled in the air, which is the tiny drops left by the undead magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The self-proclaimed Reconstruction Army’s Undead Corps fell into a trap and smashed it on the line of defense in front of the Cathedral, leaving behind the smell of bad smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has completed his army, left non-combatants in the church, and waited for another commander to complete the work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The injured person stays. The locals stay. You can't use magic, you can only use the equipment to stay."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Protestant innocent female pope, the reformist bishop Bonnie Sefer stood on the steps in front of the main church, raised his hand, and used his simple command to squat his sect They are divided into two teams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The defense is handed over to you. Try to keep yourself and clean up the remnants of the South."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp One after another, men and women with bishops and parish priests quickly gathered the fighting power of their church. Naimen was amazed at the number of middle and high-ranking clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the face of the evil undead army, we are the last and most powerful sacred defensive force of the phase port. You will face the undead army landing on the inner sea side. And sweep them out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He estimated the rough, and counted the six or seven bishops of the priesthood. That is a large army that far exceeds the number of people in the phase of the Hong Kong Innovation Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like all Protestant overhauls, the Innovation Council is also an alliance of several autonomous churches. However, because Bonnie Seifer showed amazing personal strength and organizational ability, the gatherings under the Reformation of the Holy Emblem were the most among the free nations, and they could almost compete with the powers of the Protestant Four Masters. contend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will not fight with you, the command is the responsibility of the Warlord, Mr. Nathan Soledon. After the death of General Zhu Hai, General Gao Hu, He is the de facto commander of the Freeport of the Phase Port. He will provide guidance and intelligence for you. In the harbor area, you should be able to find the Marshal Wei Taiping and his deputy, Wei Buwu, who are in charge of the fleet. It should be theirs now. The Marines are in the defense port area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One after another wearing a bishop's epaulette, wearing a complex and well-decorated close-fitting robes The former holy emblem, left to death, concentrated on their respective teams, marched eastward with a torch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our opponents are the undead of the Age of Ancient Elves, they will have all kinds of spells we can only see in ancient books, even we even record ancient books. No spells. The east line is entrusted to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only those who have more information than others, and found these commands. Uncoordinated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He scraped together to Bonnie and lowered his voice and asked, "Bonnie, do you want to deal with the immortal one alone?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the problem of resistance to the door, the Archbishop slightly bends the fingertips of her right hand, and the gold wire on the back of the white silk gloves flashes, allowing the invisible fog to block the two. Human voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The immortal is the commander of the enemy, ask Anne in detail, she is the clearest of the revival army, I don't waste time." and the speed of speech before the speech Differently, Bonnie’s speed of speech has become urgent and fast. “They are always lurking in a civilized society. According to the principle of 'the most suspicious of the beneficiaries', I think the most suspicious is the empire, and it’s down to Wei Taiping’s men. If it is the immortal of the empire, I probably know it in my heart; but if it is Wei Taiping’s men, I am afraid it will be an immortal I have never heard of...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No, I am not asking what the immortal is, probably guessing it. Even the undead empire, the organizational structure is no different from us. I want to ask is why you want to 'one person'."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because..." Bonnie paused. "If I guess wrong, there is more room for a person to go. With four or five bishops, it is possible to completely And they are tearing their faces with Yinlong? Don’t worry, even if there are immortals, they are not mys. . "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"Not like this, Bonnie? Annie told me a word. She said that my hunch now is called the 'flag of death' in your time. The same was true when Annie last lie to me." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I am not Anne. I don't like you, it won't be a dead flag." Bonnie, who is shining, raised her hand. Take a look at the hair and step back a little. "I guess a idiot must have kissed it too? If you have to bear the death mark, she really takes the character set seriously, when she is a fool..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence pokes the memory of the door. He raised his hand and whispered: "I'm sorry. I kissed it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie slammed his mouth and turned his gaze One side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry. I don't know about this...I am stupid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere It became very embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But anyway, you don't have to worry that I will lose to an immortal person. And if it is the immortal of the empire, I know who it is. Well, I haven’t been able to defeat him in the 9th paragraph, let alone the present. Yes, if you encounter a high-ranking commander like the immortal or the undead or the undead protector on the other side, you can clench your soul stone. What to do with the memory. No one is better at dealing with the undead than the gems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie flustered and said everything she said. Escaped to remove the mute magic and turned to the direction of the cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was seen from behind her, and Bonnie raised her hand to wipe her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, help me change the clean cloak!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie shouts Live a near-maid priest who is about to leave, and take off his bloody white priest's cloak. The female priest was so excited that her hands trembled, holding her cloak on her chest and forgetting to take off her cloak to the Archbishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie reached out and untied the female priest's new cloak, re-applied herself, and raised her hand to sort out her hair. Her dark brown shoulders bathed in the light, and it looked like pale gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ma!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie shouted again. Resist the door back and turn back to his team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His army is ready to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell me about the immortal on the road, Anne."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, Immortal. Among the sacred empire empire, these top casters are second only to the sleeping emperor, probably equivalent to the Orthodox Cardinal, the top of the undead magic user, especially in combat power... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young warlord clasped the blue soul jewel, stood on the horse, raised the whip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still some time to exchange fire. You can talk a little more carefully." He whispered to Anne's memory, "... let me hear her more." Sound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army began to move to the eastern port, which is close to the phase bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public horse station on the west side of the bridge <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last trace of sunshine is gradually disappearing in the mountains of the West The other side of the hill projection line left the earth with endless darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is the former phase of the port of Westport, the value of the employment mages should hold the magic wand, the magic light of Lingang Avenue will be triggered to light up; phase The guards of the Hong Kong Guard should also patrol the alleys and light the oil lamps at the key intersections to guide the night pedestrians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, only three or five lonely lights are on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of torches illuminate the road near the quayside, and more of the lights are shining on the sea, keeping the fleet connected. The workers who withdrew from the pier were trapped on the road near the waterfront. The scattered market also had a large number of people preparing to go home. More people were trapped in the harbor area because the public carriage stopped their service. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it an invasion? Did the imperial man finally come over?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a large fleet! I am afraid that the elves will retaliate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that wants to cross the bridge by public carriage is the poor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that is well known in this era is that the poor are not people, just the labor that can be bought with money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So no one came to explain to them that the war had broken out; no one told them that the public carriage had escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the Undead Legion, the poor who have no self-defense ability are only used to transform into zombie warriors; the guards will protect the poor, but in fact only to prevent the enemy Continuous growth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Ruisi stood in a panicked crowd, looking at the direction of the port with a worried look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was working from a coffee shop and was ready to return to the shelter of Donggang, which was just blocked by the invasion at the bridge of Phase Bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Di Meiyi has contacted her three times through the consumption of huge anti-detection communications, and the girl who only has a little low-level magic almost used her magic to warn her. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there really no problem? The Freedom Army of Donggang and the self-defense regiments of the major families have already assembled, and we will pick you up if necessary." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really want to find my own way. With your weapons and training level, it’s probably useless to come over. The night is coming, save some magic. Today is a day that will let all the magicians drain their limits. Don't contact again, this is the order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After passing the news back to Donggang, Bai Ruisi once again began to consider the situation at hand. As the head of the dark pillar of the Taiping Dao State in the phase port, she knows more than the average person, but not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s time to turn the money left by Miss Zhang Da into more people..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The female magician who worked in the Thieves Guild scorned her shortsightedness in her heart. Her own safety and privacy requirements are too high, resulting in her own almost no credible cronies available. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the North District! There are two, each eight gold pounds! There are two, when you are full, go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some bold taxis shouting around, claiming that they can pull people to a safe rear. But they are asking too much, and the rest of these people are not wanting to hire - probably can't afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much is the bridge?" "But though, how much is it!" "But my family is in Donggang!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few businessmen dressed up are arguing with the coachman. However, no one dared to cross the bridge. The undead warships with black sails pass through the bridge from time to time, and the wounded fifth and seventh fleet ships burned and spread like the night lights on the sea. From time to time, the glare of shells and magic shimmered on the bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can hear the sound of crossfire between the two sides in the evening breeze, and even a few exotic chanting sings mixed with the sound of the explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is colorless in the air, no thoughts, no eyes and ears..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the Dharma's caster ridding the demons... No, why can I understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Ruisi found with horror I can understand these exotic spells. Whenever she almost forgets that she is just a spare body that loses her memory, there are things that are closely related to the magical world to remind her that you are not using your own strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artillery barrier at both ends of the bridge is firing wildly. The two most recent artillery bases are not far from the public horse station. The soldiers in charge of the guards are listed as a cross-team, and the weapons in their hands are vigilantly pointing at this side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't approach the artillery barrier! The undead army is used to tricks, close to the killer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The garrison Extremely nervous use of violence to stop the crowd. In front of their queue, there are three or five civilian bodies trying to approach them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This road doesn't seem to work either..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But intuition tells Bai Ruisi, she can't Stay here. If she is the commander of the intruder, she will definitely control the bridge first, waiting for only one dead road here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...is hateful. There must be something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her fists are tight I couldn't help but think of the night that led to the death of the "Jade Ring". I think that it is a bit too optimistic to have a peace of mind when you have a backing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it safe to follow the crowd, or is it safe to escape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two seem to have their own Pros and cons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Single action will definitely be exposed, it seems too dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the usual anti-British Detecting magic is very effective, but that's because she has been careful to hide outside the scope of the high-level magician's detection. Don't say that the undead army is such a regular army that the spellcaster is greatly over-compiled. Even if the magical squad of the Freedom Army is serious, she will be as conspicuous as the torch in the night. In the darkness of the entire phase port, hundreds of investigators are sure to be active in order to find out the situation for their respective forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can follow the crowd, it seems to be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her attention to the chaotic crowd, Just a look at a young girl in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is Miss Bai? Do you live in Donggang? It’s great to find someone you know, I don’t know what to do!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably because of standing outside the crowd, the young Taoist girl shouted and rushed up and grabbed Bai Ruisi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are...ah, are you working together at a coffee shop?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Rui Si After watching her for a moment, she vaguely recalled the working companion from her mind. It seems that the refugees who have recently escaped from the Pacific Road can not think of a name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I am Xiao Yao! What is the name of White Sister?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Small voice. Everyone is very flustered." Bai Ruisi frowned and reported his pseudonym when working in the store of Ionet, "Bai Rui."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She speculates that the Taoist girl in front of her is about the same age as her own, but she is much younger than the oriental mask she used now. Anyone seems to be young and beautiful, Yao Lanbo is only fifteen or six years old, but Bai Ruisi's ordinary, even ugly appearance looks like 30 or so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since working in that store, Bai Rui’s sister is also a magician? Then we have two magicians.” Yao Lubo smashed in the direction of the port. At a glance, "The enemy does not know when it will come. I don't know what to do, but fortunately I can find someone who knows to act together..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who wants Act with you. Bai Ruisi secretly complained in his heart, but his mouth still coped with: "In this case, the Phase Port Bridge is definitely not going to go. What are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I want to go back to the coffee shop. Isn't it close to the Cathedral of the Innovation Society? Perhaps the priests there have the ability to protect us..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Ruisi The brow wrinkled into a ball. She yelled in her heart: I didn't want to go to the Reformation Cathedral and face the battle state Bonnie Sefer. If I have a face with Bonnie Sefer, will it be turned back to the tower and become a spare body? What should I do for my important companions? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this well-founded rebuttal, the young Taoist girl thought for a moment: "Do you want to move to the port? Should the port still be in the hands of the Free Army?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Then we have to set off quickly. If I am the commander of the enemy, I should cut off the bridge-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for the analysis of Bai Ruisi, There was a scream in the direction of the port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Zombies! Zombies are landing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Capture! Backward shelling!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such screams, vaguely heard the loud rhythm of sound coming from the direction of the bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This voice is...shooting the guns?! Are they shooting people who are fleeing?!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Ruisi looks around. Numerous crying people are coming in, and behind the scenes are continuous shooting sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panicked crowd and the killing army can’t stop it – let alone the army of dead people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not time to hide strength. Bai Ruisi ran away from the main road, avoiding the two people being trampled into patties, and cocking their fingers to start preparing the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparation for half, she saw that the Taoist girl was still worried, and she screamed: "Is it floating or flying?! If you can, use it quickly." Come out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let it float!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Ruisi took out the five-stage magic, grabbed the collar of the Taoist girl, and jumped on the roof of the three-story warehouse on the side of the road. Standing on the heights, she finally managed to take the entire port battlefield to her bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of zombie sailors, under the battle of the death knights who came from the water, swimming through the port area and climbing up the stone Breakwater. However, the sea corps of the Seventh Fleet also formed a strong defense line. They came from the direction of the port and pressed the largest enemy to the bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good tactics...but, thousands of poor people and civilians are unfortunately caught in the bridge and the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is also the habit of the original owner's good people... Well, maybe she is not such a terrible person." Bai Ruisi ridiculed himself in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good, great magic..." The Taoist girl who was caught by Bai Ruisi and flew up to the roof was surprised. "White sister, you magic..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xiao Yao, are you big enough?" Bai Ruisi secretly stunned himself in his heart, "tell them, the bridge can't pass, go to the city." Run and run in the direction of the Reformed Cathedral! The saint Safir will protect them there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, yes, big sister!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, under the shout of the new girl, Bai Ruisi, the crowd finally stopped in the direction of the bridge, but instead ran to the Westport City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People spontaneously repeat the command that does not know the source:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Zombie landing! Eaten ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The phase bridge is broken!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Escape to the Reformation Cathedral, The Virgin will protect us!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd crossed the avenue, crossed the intersection, and stayed in the square and wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the crowd, there are huge zombies, scorpions and ghoul squads. These incompetent creatures vent their instincts and will be left behind and injured. The civilians are killed and they become a part of themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the patrol defense line, the conductors were a young oriental general, and the eyebrows were somewhat similar to the old Marshal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that someone has commanded the civilians to retreat, and the young master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, don't worry They. We don't have enough magical and Dharma users, as long as we can hold the port line and the bridgehead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seventh Fleet's Shaoshuo Wei Buwu Pointing to his subordinates, "You can send several detachments to chase the guys who chase the civilians. It is also very troublesome for thousands of civilians to become zombies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Following, less handsome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the order was issued, the commander of the Seventh Fleet refocused his energy on the enemy in front of him. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the Eastern Empire’s martial arts ambassador appointed his son and adopted son to serve as commanders in the country, Wei Taiping also appointed his most trusted son as the flagship. Captain; When the flagship "Xiayang" was parked in the port, the flagship captain became the captain of the sea corps in Hong Kong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who stopped in front of him was the death knight who came to the sea. The invisible horseshoe of the ghost horse can walk on the water, which is the only pioneer to open up the landing site. Behind these knights, there is a ghost ship that has already entered the port and is preparing to land on the beach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't pay attention to the civilians, continue to advance! In any case, you can't let the enemy take the bridge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Donggang also has a large number of troops including the 13th Division of the Free Army, and its combat power is even above the Westport. If the Phase Harbor Bridge is taken down by the undead, the problem will probably be devastating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there are more monks in the fleet, it would be fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Western world depends Like the undead, the Eastern world also has a magical faction that is best at dealing with undead creatures - a scripture Dharma user called "Monk." Wei Taiping learned the lessons of the past and brought most of the monks to the fleet to fight the magical magic of the Ghost Fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Naim Soleton House, which has the most pastors and priests, is finally close to the West End of the Phase Bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that shocked him was a large number of civilians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people stepped on each other and stumbled on the narrow gravel road, blocking the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They yelled in the mouth with messages and commands that didn’t know where they came from; probably because of the passing of many hands, most of the messages and commands sounded ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The bridge is missing, don't go to the bridge!" "The port is occupied by the undead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to the Reformed Cathedral, the Holy Virgin will save us!" "The Virgin has arrived at the Port of Hong Kong!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last news made the door very surprised different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ordered the troops to give way to the refugees, and let the priests set up the Sanctuary magic to appease the refugees’ feelings so that they could pass the ranks in a stable and orderly manner. The gap in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Nanimen found a bishop closest to him: "Hello of the Bishop of Champagne, the message of the Archbishop in the phase port, have you announced?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of the Champagne Parish is also a mistake: "No, even after I started the invasion, I learned that the Archbishop has arrived in advance. Almost All people with formal faculty are ready to welcome you at the Cathedral."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strange. Where did the news come from?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is scornful and knuckles, thinking about the words left by Bonnie before leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a message from the empire or the fleet? Is it the news of the undead of the undead? But why should he release Bonnie in the phase port? The news? They should not know that the battle of the Reformation Cathedral is over... Is it to inform teammates!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forget it, let the Archbishops deal with it. These intrigues are not for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of refugee evacuation is not fast. Half an hour after the refugees were in the middle of the army, the former army suddenly heard gunshots, swords and swords and exotic spells, which made the spirit of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you finally fighting?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Warlord made the horse cross the queue and came to the most The battlefield ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who waited for him there was a battlefield that was completely out of his expectations and resembled hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of refugees were blocked by the undead army in the direction of the cathedral, crowded in the empty field near the phase of the public horse station - in order to dock The carriage is for people to get on and off the carriage. The area of ​​this empty field is very large, and an oblique upward slope leads to the phase bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriages that were originally parked here were towed by the defenders of the nearby artillery. The Artillery Guards turned all the light artillery into the direction of the avenue and used it to bombard the undead army that was mixed in the refugee queue. The Phase Bridge was built on a high cliff and can be used to attack the attackers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the port direction, it is the several sea brigades who strive to maintain the front line. They have several Eastern monks to assist, but they can only fight with the enemy defenders who are supported by the death knight. From time to time, there are powerful forces who climbed up from the sea and joined the numerous undead army in the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not, there are still a dozen casters and adventurers struggling to resist in the civilian population, these thousands of refugees may have been eaten by the undead army It is. Even so, their front is precarious, and every second someone becomes a food in the zombie mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s just impossible to beat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, we have worked hard, but we can't get in!
