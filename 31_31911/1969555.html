			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The port in midsummer is a bit hot, but not hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New De Latvia's latitude is at the northern end of the non-freezing line and is a natural port. Like most of the big ports of the New World in this era, the port of the city is not busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In normal days, there are only a dozen large sailboats parked in the port, which is not enough for the ports of the old mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as the goods are not loaded and unloaded, the elf sailing ship "Kleon Emperor" is parked in the offshore waters some distance from the pier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the sea corps of this ship, as usual, lay on a lounge chair and lazily hid under the shadow of the main sail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really want to go ashore..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailors on board, most of them went to the shore Vacation. He didn't want to go - just as the captain of the sea corps, he had to stay on the deck for at least twelve hours a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is his job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s boring, the bones are rusting. When are you waiting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The man touched the elf sword hanging from the right side of the waist, which is his favorite weapon. This kind of slender and flexible weapon is not very powerful. It can only poke holes in the other body. The skill and appreciation are higher than the actual value of the war. But he feels that this weapon is full of the elegance and exquisiteness of the elf. It is the weapon that suits him best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has always been eager to have the natural elegance and grace of a true elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not an elf, but a half-elf--like most captains of seafarers. Over the past hundred years, with the massive influx of humans into the Elven Port, the Half Elf and the Half-Blood Elf have become a huge race. Elves and humans are reluctant to accept them, but they cannot deny the excellence of these mixed-race children. A large number of pioneers are among them, and these half-elves form the core of the Sansen fleet and the provincial fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even this semi-decorative weapon is enough to spread his brave name in the distant sea fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People say that the "thorner" Leonard; "throatpiercer" reneade caecarwy's left-handed spike, three out of ten times Sting on the enemy's throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone requested to board the ship!" The message was uploaded from the watchtower and passed to his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf slowly sat up from the lounge chair and asked, "Is the one we are waiting for?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, there are our sailors who lead the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let them board the ship. Should the boat be up? Put down the rope ladder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let the rope ladder!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, a listless, face still The sailor with a little panic climbed up the rope ladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf recognizes that the comer is a member of his team of seamen: "Are you not going to take a vacation today? How come back so soon?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone wants to come to us..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailor hasn’t finished talking yet, on the boat There was a burst of anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened? Is there an iron ladder? This broken rope ladder is too weak!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the female alchemist is so loud that it can be heard on the watchtower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is this woman?" The half-elf frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really annoying! I didn't create it myself! Transmute, change the material!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the change of the spell magic of the material magic, the rope ladder becomes instantly Black steel. The effect of magic climbed directly onto the deck along the rope ladder, creating a large, circular area of ​​iron centered around the rope ladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哐,哐,哐! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you heard the footsteps and the gold and iron strikes, all the sailors and seamen’s faces changed, and even the captain’s half-elf pressed his left hand to the sword. On the handle. If this is seen by the captain, it is a nuisance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge golden armor climbed the iron ladder and appeared on the deck. At the moment he touched the hull, the boat's draught was one inch deep; when he was moving, the whole boat was shaking slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" Some sailors can't control their fears, pick up spare muskets from the deck, tremble and ignite the ropes, and want to preempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop! This is the Golem..." The half-elf hurriedly blocked. There are not many wizards who can make demons, and he has never seen anything in kind - but he also knows that there is such a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now it’s late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire rope has already burned to the end, and the lead bombs are also coming out with strong winds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"wood shape!塑木!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for the half-elves to react and form the deck The huge wooden board suddenly cocked and stopped before the projectile. The projectile hit the top and knocked out a deep groove, but there was no more power to move on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard! Don't you tell me to stop! This golem is used by the wizard to protect yourself, don't be rare!" In the heart, marvel at the speed of the other side Leonard; Kikawi frowned and reprimanded his subordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage who can erect the deck wood in an instant and have a golem, even in the country of the Elf, is a powerful mage...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, distinguished Master, we are not interested."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This welcome is really not Friendly.” The woman’s voice came from behind the semi-circular wooden wall with a sneer taunt. "I wonder if this is enough to be the ship's mage of this ship?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She waved her hand to dispel the magic effect, and the wooden boards around it fell, leaving some wood Slag and a few holes. At the moment the board fell, the half-elf saw the golden alchemist shining, and her long blond hair with the sea breeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, the half-elf was convinced that he saw his goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this is called love at first sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...there is no problem. You are very welcome to serve as the ship's master of the barge." His tone became very gentle and cautious, "by the way, I am Leonard; Kakawi, the captain of the sea corps of this ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She glanced at him with a slightly indifferent gaze. "The captain of the sea corps... can you decide this thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course! My decision is the final decision." The tone of her sentence Let Leonard feel a little despised, and he promised to take the chest without saying anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alchemist’s mouth is satisfied with the rise, introducing himself: “Liesha; Hermonte, 'The Alchemist of Pure Gold', I am very glad to meet you.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am too, very happy to meet you." The semi-elf answered this phrase is full of sincerity, absolutely from the heart. "By the way, why is your lady's title 'pure gold'? It seems a bit..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because every woman likes gold, doesn't like metal Lei, said a cold joke as a reply. "So that's it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leisha smiled softly, tapping the palm of the half-elf with the tip of her right finger, and then she retraced it: "Go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the two Walking down the cabin, all the sailors next to him shook their heads. Like most ships of the elves, the average sailor on this ship is mostly humans and half-elves - and is also keen to chat with the boss's gossip news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s over. Is this compromised?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a complete disregard of the captain, since Gu Zi promised to come down... I think he will have trouble later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The old problem has broken again. Does the captain believe in love at first sight?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably there is a estrus period. It is said that elves, quasi-elfs, and half-elves have estrus..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "This is an animal taxonomic problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kleon Emperor is a large ship. The sails are dark green, soaked in special fire-resistant oil; it glows brightly in the sunlight, in stark contrast to the faint blackwood hull. Three huge masts point to the sky, two hang the vertical spinnaker, and the one in front hangs a square cross. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of ship that is all horizontal sails is generally called 'carrack', which is the 'three-legged cross-boat'. As long as it is under the wind, this one The speed of the ship is the highest in the world!" The half-elves boasted about their own ships, but the alchemists were not interested in this technical issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are those under the canvas?" Rees pointed to the raised protrusions on the two decks. "Cannons?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Leonard replied. "The short deck is a 6-pound light cannon, here is an 18-pound gun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two, four, six, eight..." The hand held the chin and counted. "As a merchant ship, there are really many artillery pieces. Plus a total of 36 doors above, really big. How many tons of stowage do you want to lose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, how many tons can't be reduced, only 12 6-pound light cannons and 24 18-pound long shots. After all, the recent Columbus Sea and Emerald Bay are not very calm. Our Elf merchant ships are particularly threatened. Everyone has strengthened. Armed. Let's go down and look at the cabin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard hurriedly circumvented the topic and took Reza to the interior of the cabin. The female alchemist thought for a moment, and her face showed a clear expression. She looked up at the top of the mast, where the green olive branch of the Emerald Trade Alliance was hung. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turned out not to be a 'cross trident'..." She said to herself, followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the cabin, divided into three floors. The first and second floors are mainly residential areas, and there are also several storage compartments; the third floor is almost all storage compartments. Leonard pointed at the narrow aisle. “Generally, if you sleep 12 or 16 people in this cabin, you will hang the hammock in a narrow cabin. Of course, the resident mage can have a separate room.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"How many people are there? Can you free up a new room?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"160 people, 22 cabins, still barely enough "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"160 people...a lot. How many real Saint-Sensiers?" Reza asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"110..." The half-elf blurted out, "...oh, look like you already know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He has sweating on his forehead. This woman looks like a thick line, but the observation is unexpectedly good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resa smiled and turned to the topic: "Take me a cabin on the deck. I can't get in the corridor." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The cabin on the deck, I am afraid..." Leonard; Kakawi secretly complained that all the cabins were occupied. The chief officer, the dining room, the rudder wheel cabin, the sea corps... "Hey, there is one, but it will be vacated tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the moment, it is still not good. Our goods have not been finished yet, and the price of sugar has not yet fallen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two chatted out of the cabin, just listened The report came to the watch tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone asks for boarding!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf looked at the woman beside him and asked Road: "What position is it applying for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, pastor, come with our accounting in the market."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way, then please ask them to board the ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reshua keenly captured the half-elf saying this sentence The words of joy in the eyes flashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really amazing, don’t know who made it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you use gold as a material, you must have an internal structure that is so complicated that there are a lot of magic-driven parts. However, it is not necessary to use gold to expose all the gold outside, this taste..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she returned to the deck, she heard two people talking about her golem. The two men were dressed in a priest's gown, a middle-aged, wearing a yellow robes of the Orthodox bishop; the other was still very young, wearing a black-and-white robes of the trainee's pastor, with some ridiculous high hats. They all put all their hair in the hat, which is the standard dress of the Orthodox priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The normal reaction should be to question the men around the two Orthodox priests appearing on this Elf warship; but when they hear the "taste" At the same time as the word, the alchemist lost his self-control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it yours that just criticized this golem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this is full of murderous The sound of the golden glare rushed down the deck, and the trainee and the bishop regressed a few steps. As a result of the age, the bishop smashed at the seams of the iron and the wood and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is you saying that my taste is low, the upstart?" Resa stared at the trainee pastor and asked word by word. Under the intimidation of her imposing manner, the whole boat entered the cold current; the golden golem "Ganda" also stood up, as if facing the two priests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I want to say that your taste is very unique." Pastor Pastor snorted and answered carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murderous moment is turned into nothing, and everyone is relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, why do you both think of this elf vessel coming to work? I remember that the Elf Church and the Orthodox Church have been expelled from each other." The thoughts returned to normal. After the track, she immediately asked the doubts in her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trainee looked at the bishop with an inquiring look, and the bishop was struggling to get up. Even in the heart of the woman's fickle, the middle-aged man answered her question seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because no human merchant ship has to return to the Old World recently, we must hurry back to the job. This ship happens to be out of the air because there is no pastor. We will not If you meet the priest of the sun, there will be no embarrassing problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer is quite reasonable. But the woman's instincts tell Reza that something is hidden outside of this answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we should have spent this trip together, two pastors. I am the ship's master of the ship, Reza; Hermont. She introduced herself in a blank expression, not leaking her inner instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Bishop of Limaland (bishoprimaland), Belber; Belery gas." Middle-aged people also introduced themselves, "and this Bit, is my disciple, Knop, still in the trainee period. I hope we can cooperate happily from then on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"willing to cooperate happily." "I may have to go missing today because I have to move things to the boat. Whether it is as a woman or as an alchemist, I have a lot of things I have to bring."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
