			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black carriage "crawled" the towering third wall and disappeared Chaos in the downtown area of ​​Lenny. The carriage was observed in five or six observation towers around, and then smoke was ignited. Hundreds of soldiers rushed out of the hidden place and chased the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xu Lan; Feng; Di Mattel looked at the carriage and went away with a satisfied smile on his face. He is driving an unremarkable rental carriage and following the most inconspicuous trail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, Nika has provided us with an overview of the roads in the city, otherwise we will be able to count it." He turned his head and looked at it. Inside the car asked: "Very distinguished guests, this postal car has not many passengers, may be a little crowded, is it comfortable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Faint's blessing, there will probably be no protests here. But you, why did you perform this task?” The voice of Viscount Rasta came from inside the car. “I heard that you took a good job and protected it last time. A noble lady with a good character, good looks, and a handsome body is traveling... How suddenly became a special agent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't mention, I was The agent of the highest lord lord grabbed the strong man. As a result, the good work was gone, and it was necessary to save the three big men - this is against my aesthetics." The chief guard of the Guardian snarled, "Don't talk nonsense, now But in the martial law. If you can't find Miss Wei Lun, we will definitely be seen."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rasta asked: "Miss Wei Lun? I have never heard of such a female magician. Is she strong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "She is what we found... Hey!" Xilan rushed to pull the reins, let the carriage turn into the alley, and evaded a search team before continuing. "Genius magician. She will have a very amazing spell." That, and the one that our Missy will meet is a perfect match..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alley came to an end and suddenly turned into a hollow space with a small building. Pike sitting next to the knight; Tap suddenly reached out and yanked the stable; two young women dressed as rogues were standing in front of the carriage. One of them stretched out his right arm and stopped in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gentlemen, take a ride?" She giggled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a meeting place." The Assassin said, "It’s not funny."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah... it’s really boring, you can see it all at once." The girl was slightly disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After knowing your original magic, you don't pay attention to these problems, Miss Weilun." Xiu Lan rubbed his face with his hand. "Use real identity, 黛妮卡, Olia. Have you collected enough 'copy' of your needs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure, long enough "Another woman replied, "Sufficiently different soldiers. We were almost caught in the previous meeting place and used this identity to escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After hearing the conversation outside, the passengers inside the carriage have got off. Rasta looked at the two skin-exposed girls and hurriedly twisted her face to the side; Govart saw it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me, Xiulan, is this her original magic? Isn't there anything special about this transformation of magic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xu Lan; Dimartel smiled: "No, this is different. This magic can't be detected with normal detection magic, unlike other kinds of magic that can only become limited." A creature or a human that looks very stiff. Its inventor called it 'Perfect Capability' because this magic can escape almost all of the detection magic for the transformation, such as 'appearing', 'dissipating' or 'Restoration'. It uses the principle of 'anti-detection' and similarity to turn a person into another person with minimal change. Do you understand why I say this magic is perfect match with Missy?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Copying. It's a perfect match." Rasta suddenly realized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goval inserted a sentence: "So, our plan is to rely on the two people to lead the other side of the main force, and then use this magic to become an enemy soldier. Then broke out from the west gate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"East Gate?!" Marshal was shocked. "There must be ours on that road... No, the enemy's command! How can we..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It is because there is a response force waiting outside the East Gate. It is a good plan, Betsy will be played by the group, and the Helna kid will be fooled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; A magnetic middle-aged voice has never been known. Rasta hurriedly looked at the first secretary of state who was supporting him: Chase was still in a coma, not him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He looked up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice continued. As soon as people looked up, they heard a squeaky explosion of "touching". The empty carriage is instantaneously used as a powder without knowing what magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of the people who looked up, their faces changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crad; Lopez!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Return of the Far East, the Commander-in-Chief of the Southwest Army exudes a faint blue light that floats from the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, sorry to disturb you. Have you had lunch yet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The attack was shot from the middle-aged man who was calmly talking and laughing. The most dazzling was the light blue sword rain. Blu-ray is like countless long whip, flying along the path that Clade draws in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rasta’s “honor” has not been able to get out of the sheath, and all the ropes were cut by the blue light and fell underground. The old marshal only felt that his legs were numb, his standing was unstable, and he stumbled down on the wreckage of the carriage. Xiu Lan shouted "Sacred Plus" to block the deadly attack, but was still rushed to the corner by the flood of force. Parker tried to avoid, but failed to escape. The pockets for storing various tools were all cut, and the mess of metal and non-metal products fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone feels the feeling of being called "fear": How do the enemies in front of them hold overwhelming power? How can you always chase them, how terrible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the middle-aged man failed to defeat everyone. A petite figure plunged into his close-knit defensive circle with the help of accelerated magic, and her palms surrounded the orange glow of some kind of contact magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krad immediately recognized this dangerous paralyzed spell, slammed back two steps back against the wall, recalled his own bodyguards, and others felt pressure light. He bowed his head and shunned, his left hand slammed at the bottom of the wall, and a wooden board bounced; the girl's fist hit it, and the paralyzed magic dissipated. In the hands of the general, Blu-ray was on display, pointing to her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finally saw the woman’s face, his face suddenly changed and the attack completely lost control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blu-rays are countless meteors, all aimlessly hit the surrounding walls. Just like eating a stick, Clade swayed back and took the blue light back into his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Senikan... Why are you here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father, I met."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yenica’s cherry-like lips trembled and squeezed out to shock everyone around me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general and the general’s daughter are squatting. The faces of the father and the daughter are completely different, but the temperament that is emitted when Shura is killed is extremely similar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the more difficult and less cumbersome and paranoid. Even if there are good reasons, it will not come up with the kind of character that eases the situation. If you change the description of the method, it is the two bulls who are fighting, and no one will back down even half a step. Their accumulated magic puts tremendous pressure on the people around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are silent actions when they are companions, they are often overlooked or even scorned; only when they face them as enemies, they will feel like uploading from them. Great pressure coming. This trait is particularly evident in the people of Lopez. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard him, Rasta squeezed a cold cry from his nose. "Don't pretend to have a gentleman's appearance. Can you interfere with them? First climb out of the hole in the wall and say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xulan Breathing , stood up laboriously. He left a huge human-shaped pothole on the wooden wall behind him, which was the result of a barely blocked Klad's raid. "You can't go anywhere? First pull out your broken sword."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s been the second time in a few days, okay. This time it is a wooden wall, not a stone wall. After going back, I am afraid that it will be reprimanded by the big head to death." Rasta pulled out the sword and sat down against the wall. "If the two guys who are going to lure the enemy are Just fine, relying on their magic is probably barely able to compete with this terrible guy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sword and outdated divine power, probably not Well, without the support of others, the Cavaliers are nothing.” Xiu Lan sighed. “In this case, we can’t use the help of Yanika. Look at it quietly, ready to escape. We are ready to escape. We are ready to escape. It is impossible to kill Krad here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Escape? How to escape? You mean..." Rasta suddenly understood. If it doesn't work, use Renee to block her father, and the rest of the people will break through with all their strengths... Thinking of this, the Liberation Knight is shuddering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the unrequited father and daughter quarreling continues, no one has any concessions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Retract your magic, 黛妮卡."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Never."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have to do it with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The rebellion of adolescence is not worth gambling." Clad persuaded that the instant magic and flying swords in his hands did not mean to relax. "The things here and you." It doesn't matter, and it's very dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? You can throw your wife and go to the distance to take risks, I have to stay at home like a daughter. My life is more expensive than your life? Forget it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you don't have to choose to abandon your motherland because of me? It is treason! Why do you choose to be in the empire, the narrow empire? They are destroying our judiciary! I guarantee that Lord Govar will be given a fair trial, which is what we have promised. I am guaranteed by my reputation. One point, I will never let Betsy arbitrarily manipulate the court. I will let Ruolock return to the Federation without any punishment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krad's tone is very sincere . Seeing the look of Seneca's contempt, he turned his eyes to Govar and tried to ask for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raditz, who was leaning against the wreckage of the carriage, was not injured; he thought for a moment and felt that these were things that were in the interest of Clade and nodded. "Although I shouldn't attach your father, but what he said should be true. After all, Betsy is the biggest opponent on Lopez's power path."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" Come home, 黛妮卡, then nothing has happened. We should probably spend more time to get to know each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl subconsciously stepped back half a step and bowed her head; she felt that her heart was faltering. Do you want to trust your father again? After all, blood is thicker than water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood is thicker than water. The blood of Lopez always flows in her blood vessels, the blood of the man who is ambitious. She believes that what he said is true... she is almost shrinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you go to the empire, I will find it hard to see you. Although I am an incompetent father... but I still hope to see you get Happiness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hand trembled. Is her happiness here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows very well that her father will not give up his ambition until he dies - he has spent most of his life, traveled the whole world, looking for him The technology, system and experience you want. She does not believe that she has the ability to compete with that heavy twenty years. Become a daughter of the general, or become a monica himself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finally made her final determination. "First of all, I am only a civilian. I have the freedom to choose my position. Secondly, I have not set foot on the territory of the empire, nor have I seen the rule of the empire. I cannot assert whether they are lenient or narrow. Finally... I am not I think that you are the right father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is heavily played on Lopez, he is a heavy hammer and takes a step back. "Nonica, why do you say this? Everything I do is for my country, the people and you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not use this kind of words Cover up, father! Didn't you notice it yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you notice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What do you do yourself? Grab credit, make politicians, bribe justice... What is the difference between you and Betsy? What is the difference between you and the emperor?” Yanika sneered ruthlessly, with exaggerated words. Covering your previous shakes, "Your hand is already dirty, father! How can I believe that you are a party to justice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was This is the case in the daughter's eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crader muttered, the blue light in his hand swayed and seemed to be out of control at any time. The people around them subconsciously stepped back a few steps, fearing that he could no longer control his magic in his anger. The magical power of the senior mage is terrible, and no one knows what kind of spells will fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sound in the alley, the terrible silence lasts for a long time, for a long time. Finally, the blue light in the middle-aged man’s hand swayed and went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go. I won't stop you, and I won't inform other people." His words contained a deep sense of powerlessness. "Go out." Your own path, 黛妮卡, today is for you. You can give up my daughter's identity, I will not stop you; but please remember, I will always have a place for you to come back here." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krad turned away and got into the nearest small hotel. His steps were swaying, and each step was very heavy, completely different from the temperament of his arrival. Renee stared coldly at his back and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember the intelligence that he was a Parker, and should ban bars." Rasta thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiu Lan took a look at his illegitimate friend and opened the subject: "Let's go. Since the people of Klad will not interfere with us anymore, The problem was only the French and the destroyed carriage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is no problem with camouflage, I have already left a copy of the general’s appearance. "The Princess Aurea, who had been hiding outside the attack, approached the carriage that had become a broken plank. "We can use these horses to disguise themselves as cavalry. The information left by Isaac says the third and fourth. The magic of the detection on the wall of the city can be mixed in the ordinary way. Only the fifth wall is the all-around detection network..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just said In half, the wreckage of the carriage suddenly trembled, and the great first Secretary of State of Ruhrock climbed out from the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened? Where is this? How long have I passed out?" Chase; Brighton stared at them with a dejective look. Seeing his appearance, and remembering his previous eloquence, the group also sighed at the same time. In the end, it was still Shulan who explained everything briefly to him, and said that Chase had heard it three times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this time, Olia picked a copy of several soldiers and projected it, and then I will slightly modify the imagery and give it to everyone. Easy to accommodate. Because Govar had the temperament of a senior officer, they decided to let the old Marshal Yi Rongcheng Lopez, and Seneca used the original face to cover up for him; this is better than the various guard posts under the martial law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only two horses, then Olia, disguised as an eunuch, took one, and Lord Govard and Renee shared the same name in the name of the father and the daughter. Others walked." Ignoring the bitterness of Chase, Xiu Lan issued orders for thoughtful ladies and the elderly. Jenny frowned, but she thought that there were only two horses and she did not protest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t want to stop and make a new trip to the East. What they didn't know was that Clade let them go because of Yanika's eloquence and affection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Under this sudden emotional attack, I actually took it for three minutes before I entered his heart... It was just emotion, and I couldn't control it at all. How strong is this man's psychology?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She waved her hand to the coachman and motioned to get the carriage back to the nearest shelter. These hidden places based on the Rusher Information Network will soon be no longer safe. She is only taking the time to let these places play the heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I won't be able to help you, Lord Govard. Ask yourself with Chase for more happiness."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her carriage and Nanimen passed by Anne, and she and he were about to rush to the east wall to confirm the blockade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "gift" left by Clade is indeed timely: Govar’s order in the name of Lopez can definitely be faked - or, to hear the order The soldiers did not mean anything to refuse. The senior officers who have been honed from the battlefield have their own singularity, and the prohibition is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The situation in the north is now in a hurry. You will organize the organization immediately and squeeze out half of the people to reinforce the North Gate. The enemy is probably near the North Fourth Gate, along the ring wall. The avenue will be able to go in the past. Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow!" The commander of the guardian Dongsanmen saluted him and left with his men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ability makes the side of Xiu Lan look a little envious: "They can also command without the difference of identity, really great...if I have this kind of The ability will not come here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Rasta heard his self-talk and asked strangely: "What? Don't you? Isn't it voluntary to guard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, no." The chief guard knight consciously lost his words. "I just said that I admire you and Govar." People. We rarely have the opportunity to actually participate in the war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trust me, the war is not good." The Viscount sighed thoughtfully, "I am more than Anyone wants today's things to be solved without fighting. I believe that Lord Govar is the same. Only those who write epics in safe places like war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;黛尼卡 dissatisfied and gave them a glance: "The time agreed with the contingents is coming, we should set off." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, it is a good thing for a man to have a pure friendship. Of course, it would be better if you sublimate." The appearance is a free military officer. Princess Olia turned over and said loudly, "Let's go, Lord General! There are several military stations in front to be mobilized!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, good "Clarde; Lopez" returned to his horse, first to help Yanika to go to the horse, and then carefully sitting behind her. The old marshal was very careful in the range of action, and did not cause the girl's resentment and embarrassment. The surrounding soldiers talked about them in a little bit, and Gowar repelled them with just one look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Starting, go to the barracks of Dongdaemun." He waved his whip, and the group passed the third door. The detection magic here has some reaction to the spells on the pedestrian, but as everyone knows, Lieutenant General Lopez is a magic expert, and no one is suspicious. How can there be a few magical spells on the body when the mage moves on weekdays? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaving the guards’ eyes, Govar stopped Malay. "I think that now we should turn into the path and go back to the last two doors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? There is a big detection network in front, which can be started as soon as possible. It’s best to leave before.” Xiu Lan raised an objection. “It’s very troublesome to break through. Besides, the time for the appointment is coming soon.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We are probably already exposed As long as one person knows the whereabouts of General Lopez, we may be seen. Their reinforcements will surely follow the main road, and the speed is faster than us." The former marshal's tone is plain, but very persuasive. After a group of people discussed it, they turned to the path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the two eunuchs who "know the generals of General Lopez" arrived at the gate only three minutes later than them. After listening to the description of the left-behind soldiers, the two realized that this was not the right thing - not because Lopez had too many followers, but because he was carrying his "daughter". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
