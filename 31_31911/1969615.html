			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hours later Standard calendar December 24, 1665, 5 pm<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment If someone looks at the entire human civilization world west of the Great Wilderness from a high altitude, he will see a very special artificial landscape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting from the oasis town established by humans on the Great Wilderness River until the west side of the Sanctuary occupied by the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the extremely frozen harbour city of Dizza in the north, to the southernmost hottest summer outpost Nadite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From DeLand and Rennie, which has a history of more than a thousand years, to the new fortress Newburgh, which has just been established for less than two decades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, countless white lights--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and from those orthodox churches Shot in the church of the new church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, they were shot from monasteries and welfare homes hosted by monks and nuns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, they were shot from the missionaries who stood in the square and held the prayer of the Holy Emblem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, from countless wandering in the wild and priests stationed in the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Millions, no, millions of people raise their heads at the same time, looking up at the sky and praying earnestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the grace of the Gods be with us forever. God is happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Happy New Year's Day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy New Year!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal New Year The holiday begins at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The happy ocean is spreading, countless candlelights are lit and swaying in people's hands. The busyness and tiredness of the earth have been suspended, and replaced by the joy and joy of the soul world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the chefs are still busy, putting all kinds of big dishes on the table at the Shenneng dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost everyone is preparing for this exciting New Year holiday, which will be a happy, carefree night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the grace of the Gods be with us forever. God is happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At the end of the prayer, the handsome young man with short brown hair stood up from his seat and walked to the room behind the cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hangs his own blue sacred emblem on his chest and greets each of the busy priests who are friendly on the same road. After the resignation of the bishop, it was time for Metty; Crosso's performance, as the chief manager - specifically, she - naturally went to the background to supervise everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Bonnie; Sefer, it’s very important tonight, she has a deal to complete. That goes back to the night of talks with Nikolay...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to declare something in advance, although we have reached an agreement, but this agreement It may not be possible to do so. Now, by me alone, I am not sure to pass the proposal in Parliament." After signing his name seriously on the contract, the Second Secretary of State reminded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie’s mouth swayed and nodded: “Is this why you choose to send a secret agent? Prepare to bypass the parliament to reach a contract and then pass it to the parliament for approval? Decisive choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Exactly, there are more than one such secret negotiation in progress, and the liberation of the Knights sent by the Empire is already in Foti Fort. Some royalists and locals are looking forward to this secret negotiation. Some of them want to be the new Duke of Ruhrlock.” Nikolay’s tone was scornful. “We intend to reach with Lenny. An agreement that is in our favor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Liberation Knight...the Knights who are almost all spies?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frasol; Visa Rasta, who is said to be the military minister Loren; von; the illegitimate son of Figota."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the name, Bonnie had been slamming the tip of the ground and suddenly slammed into the air, seeming to think back: "Frasol; Rasta, one of the three liberation knights? Then they are really... value it. You Wouldn't there be any plans to compromise with them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We and Margaret Govar are not the ones who will succumb to the empire, but the situation is very subtle." Nikola face has a hard time. "After all, the pro-imperial forces are heavily weighted in the politics of Julesch, and there are many localists who advocate "no autonomy without victory" to oppose peace negotiations..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I say, can I have a way to make you gain an advantage in the parliamentary vote?" Bonnie saw the time was ripe and spoke up. "You have those who may oppose What is your list of members?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is or not, no You are planning to bribe...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie smiled mysteriously: "Of course it is not so stupid. By the way, my lady has always admired you. The same person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, she still remembers the expression on the face of the Secretary of State at that time, it was really interesting - she never thought she could Nikola's cold, sullen face saw this complex and interesting expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With such a happy mood, she pushed the door of the temporary backstage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy New Year, Metty. Are you ready? We are going to start."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; When Bonnie came in, the blonde girl player was throwing a coin in front of the mirror and muttered to herself. When she heard her voice, Metty immediately hid the coin in her arms and stood up with a little panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bang... No, Pluto, you are finally here. Do you want to start?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Well, it’s about to start soon. Do we still remember those points during the daytime?" Bonnie stepped forward and patted her shoulder gently with the right hand ready for blessing magic. Don't be nervous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Relax, I am an expert in playing." Metty raised his chin and tried to be confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing her expression, Bonnie felt a little funny: "That's good, good luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, Metty interrupted her like a stepping on the tail: "Bonnie! No one told you, can't say 'good luck' before any performances.' Is it going to make things go bad! Go out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie; Sefir stunned and wanted to correct her title error; but After thinking about it, I still retired. She knew that the lady is very nervous now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After driving away Bonnie, Metty; Crosso re-sit in front of the mirror. Through the narrow door frame in the background, she can hear the noise outside. There is always a noise that comes from a myriad of whispers before the show begins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice is very familiar and very tired. The name "genius girl performer" is a fence for Metty, a barrier that binds her life. She has repeatedly tried to run away from home as a small resistance, but each time she failed because of her ability and the strength of her parents. She is the jewel of the Cross family - just a jewel in the palm of her hand. She should not have her own ideas, nor should she have her own will, but exist as a totem of the family and the bank...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meddy; Crosso Slowly put on the white silk woven gloves, this action looks elegant in the mirror. While wearing gloves, Metty also entered a state that a performer should have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Metty has the confidence to complete a perfect performance. Since her parents discovered that she has the talent for this, all the education and training she has received is done for this purpose - this ability is already part of her life. Then, as she played more and more and became more and more comfortable, she found that she could rely on music to give listeners a variety of emotions: happiness, excitement, pride, sadness, depression...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That has always been a secret, and she has no intention of telling others, including parents. But not long ago, someone saw her ability - and told her, "I need your ability." That was the first time she felt that she was needed as a "Medie; Crosso", not as a "genius girl performer" or "Miss of Crosso". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meddy; Crosso pushed the door out of the room. There is no one outside, and Bonnie has left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, she canceled the latest runaway plan and decided to follow the person for the first time that she only had her own performance...but she just Why do you want to get angry with Bonnie? She used to be less superstitious...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meddy; Crosso walked down the narrow aisle of the cathedral to the main hall, passing the road for more than three hundred years. The back of the historical organ. This organ was built in the golden age of the Second Empire. The specification is a large piano with a five-layer keyboard. There are twenty-two bellows, using both magic and human resources. More than a dozen monks gathered in the vicinity of the bellows, monitoring more than 50 kinds of green and blue magic stones that were dotted with stars in the total air outlet, and prepared to use manpower to supplement the air volume in case of a situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie is almost as big as her, but has an unfathomable eyelid that is not commensurate with her age. Although the appearance is fresh and lovely, it seems to be non-threatening, but it can reach the soft underbelly of a veteran such as her father at the negotiating table. Metty has never seen anyone who can make her father admire in business, but that day she heard the "smart old George" muttering that "the future is awesome." She is a completely different type from Metty. When Metty traveled around and enjoyed flowers, applause and praise, what kind of life did this girl live? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metti; Crosso wraps around the back of the organ and looks around the field. Tonight's St. Warren's Cathedral is packed full of seats: After receiving a charity performance invitation from the Council of Ministers, most of the celebrities in Kengler decided to attend – most of them are high-ranking members of parliament. She looked at the crowd and gave her a slight applause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl who is now dressed as a man, named Bonnie; Seifer’s sixteen-year-old girl, is her steward and producer. Take care of all the affairs of this performance. Should she have gone to a VIP seat in the back and watch her play? Bonnie is always so confident and so mobile...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metti; Crosso gently pulls up the long skirt and sits down on the organ playing position . In an instant, the scene was silent. Sitting in front of the organ, she couldn’t seem to jump off as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can only vent her waywardness and cover her true heart with her lively character. As a performer, she also has her usual character. Which one is her true character? Metty didn't know it. To Bonnie; Sefer, she is not awkward... but envious. - Perhaps because of this, when she saw Bonnie, she felt inexplicably nervous and irritable. The brown-haired girl can do anything with confidence, just like a man; and Metty has almost nothing, can't do anything...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "As long as you think, you can change the world with performance. I believe you can do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I saw her, Bonnie; Sefer told Metty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this sentence, she calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn't do anything well, she still has the ability to play this thing. In this matter, she can beat Bonnie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, she saw the music itself through the scores in front of her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her fingers are on this four hundred-year-old keyboard, full of power and confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eighth note of the tablet jumped out of her fingertips and then became an Allegro's sixteen points after a few bars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are different tuning doors that come out of those sound tubes, and even the surrounding fire is also prosperous, filled with air called "awe "atmosphere of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amazing harmonies are like the works of a whole band, with the golden age of faith and piety, flowing under the leaping fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metty knows that this is what she can do. As long as it is a positive emotion, it is not difficult to convey it - people rarely follow these feelings, but they are easily moved by these. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using music to conquer the hearts of the audience is her own magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nikolay; Machiavelli gradually began to feel that something was wrong - from the moment the organ played. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organ of the organ is full of his body and mind, from head to toe, immersed in the sacred and magnificent momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can even hear the angel’s whispers, and enjoy the extreme solemnity and joy, as if he is in another world, will be thrown away The earth's shell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is just an average person, or an ordinary magician, he will really be immersed in the atmosphere of peace and joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is not an ordinary person. He is the only "half body" of the world's only known master. Although he does not use the tyrannical spells of the dominating class, he is also familiar with the manifestations of such magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now feels...somewhat a little like Maggie; Miss Veri personally uses the feeling of dominance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect is far from the difference, but the essence hidden in it is exceptionally similar. With beautiful music as a medium, when someone reacts and wants to resist, it will be suppressed by the surrounding immersion atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always thought that the housekeeper who disguised as a man was what she called "Miss" herself; but now he has to start re-evaluating this unsolicited The true ability of the partner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the other party be a group of two or even more people, just like him and Maggie? So savvy people, is it just the "divided body" of the organ playing the organ on the stage? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the performance of tomorrow, if you feel wrong, please let me know. I will wait nearby to prove that I am not malicious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nikolay remembered the woman who planned the concert to remind him. If it weren't for her reminder, maybe he wouldn't notice the weird... but he wouldn't ask for her help. The second secretary of state just grabbed the ring on his right index finger and stood up to walk outside the VIP. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie; Sefer is still waiting outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Someone who has a spear often has a shield, and I seem to be waiting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect you to use this deviant way to influence the decision of the parliament. Where are the talents found? The monster's friends are also monsters." Nikolay pulled out the pipe from the suit pocket and walked along the second floor. The cloister went to the window and lit. The church should have been smoke-free, but the second secretary of state did not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your speech is very gentlemanly." Bonnie frowned. "Is this a word for a young lady?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are two types of women, stupid women and good opponents. You are the latter, so you don't have to use a gentleman's demeanor." Nikolay licked the pipe, "No matter what, You have helped me a lot in the voting, so Maggie's peace talks can be recognized in Congress. This is a good start for our portfolio."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But will it be late? I got the news that Wiener; Betsy temporarily requested an emergency meeting tomorrow evening. You should also get this news?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nikolay slowly nodded: "But I can't see his intentions. Why do you want to choose the Shenna Festival? Wiener; Betsy is our and our The realist like Marshal Valle can't bother the whole New Year's holiday for the sake of a good day. What is he going to do?"<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie leaned on the pillar and listened to the organ playing the next movement, and the fingers kept tapping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's think about what Admiral Betsy might do. His chances of making peace are close to zero. The public opinion of Sri Lanka, but this will not make him anxious. There is a 12th division who can attack Kengler, but this division is too weak to use. If you want to attack Fort Vatti, the 3rd Division can use it at any time. Plus the 11th Division or the 9th Division... It can't be three divisions, otherwise the Northern Defense will collapse. Is there any news of the attack on Fort Vatburg?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
