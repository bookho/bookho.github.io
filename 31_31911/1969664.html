Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summer sun is coming very early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Elf Army plunged on the Western Front, and a rushing legion was cut."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛Ms. Nika von Figueta stood in front of a huge strategic map and read the latest newsletter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mistakes piled up into mistakes. The one with fewer mistakes can win. Under the combined attack of the two countries, that person can still hold, and can continue Offensive..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no room in the staff room at this time, only the messenger of the Royal Security Ministry was far away from the corner. The Ministry of Security guarantees that at all times there will be three magic messengers at the headquarters and will be in charge of contacting the rest of the forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it’s over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 picked up the last express Use the index finger to stroke the line of words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the evening of the 17th, the Fegota public arrived on the plateau west of the mountains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;She repeated the first line of this contingency with a soft voice, moving the three symbols representing the Figota army over the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green hair flashed slightly in the corner of her eyes, Maggie yavi's voice sounded calm: "A full 20-day march, counterattack The power has finally come together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Majje's body has long since died, and the soul has been detained as a slave to the security minister, but she still left her own will. This replica only exists in the minds of Jonica Vernon von Figota, and on the magic net that has just been established. Renee is more used to calling her a shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senikan continued reading the report, "In the process of crossing the mountains, an unexpected landslide took away 300 people and 12 nobles. "Life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Coman people are divided into three separate items, men, women and nobles." Shadow? Maggie's voice continues, she is now It seems to be sitting at the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡's lips are up. "What about me? Those guys have recently looked at me with some strange look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel that for these nobles, go out at night and Miss aristocratic lady who killed a dozen uninteresting harassers is not a woman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But that is your magic." "It’s what you proposed to test it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of Maggie’s pretense did not hear: "Of course you can’t be a nobleman, nobility It’s a man... I personally think they see you as a monster. It might be that the man’s head will be hung on the wall of his home to decorate.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a certain degree of fear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, but this is not enough. Now they will not be afraid of you more than 'An incomparable aristocratic lady'...you need more than fear, but awe. You must be awe from the bottom of your heart. Let the men feel when you see you. Fear of awe, this can reduce the difficulty of controlling them with spiritual magic. Whether you want to be the queen of the empire, this is useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this On a straightforward analysis, Seneca snorted: "I... I didn't think so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get it, I used to do it... Hey, The emperor obviously has a feeling for you. From a spiritual point of view, he may still be a child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your reminder." Renee pays attention Concentrate on the document, "Let's continue. In order to bypass, there are three hundred people missing in the process of exploring the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only one-third. 13,000 people, with half the weight, should be enough." Yanika turned over a page, "They broke a 300-strong militia, this army is affiliated with Confucianism. Locke local army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, the enemy knows. Then, immediately inform the father and adults." The tone of the shadow is still full of what is called Taunting seasonings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior sat back at his desk and began conceiving orders Wording. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the enemy already knows the existence of the surprise attack, the Muse Department, which was originally opposed to the Feigota army, will immediately break the cover force north. The entire Lenni army will also move from attack to defense, and their small forces scattered around the north will immediately gather together... Clad’s forces, even the more northern Eugene forces guerrillas near Fort Steel Will go south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, all the Free Army will be assembled in one place. The next war will be...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "End the battle of the whole war... No, end the war of all wars."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡's quill pen quickly writes on paper: "Operation code: Final battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From DeLand Fort Foti, with a straight line distance of more than two thousand kilometers. In order to get here, the army crossed the towering mountains and the endless sea - and that was only the beginning of the war, far from the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as there is money, there is a boat, you can always get supplies!" The logistics department asserted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, a large amount of money flowed out of the pockets of emperors and nobles and flowed to the hands of middlemen and transporters. After the sea power of the West Intresam changed hands, the speculators from all over the country were crowded with the imperial emperor's court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonyka continued to write the second paragraph -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The princes worked hard. The austerity supply will end from the evening of July 18. The logistics department should ensure that each company has at least the equivalent of 18,000 standard magic units of magical combat power and enough supplies and combat supplies for five consecutive days of offensive use." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To the Northern Line, give supplies to the South Line! Double fists close together, gather the Western Generals in Central Ruslock!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff is so asserted. The only path to victory has already begun in front of them. The forward of the Fygota public crossed the mountain range. The harbinger of the decisive battle between the South Army and the Northern Army has already appeared on the other side of the horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third paragraph-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Northern Lines should defeat the Lenny Army at all costs. And with the Fegota public meeting to obtain follow-up replenishment. Take the offensive suppression of the southwestern army, see the command of each unit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The other four main forces The position is under our control!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Intelligence Department asserts this. As a result, the order of the Imperial Command has not been chosen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth paragraph-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything is in control. From now on, In the name of His Holiness Emperor Gustav and the Commander-in-Chief of the Duke of Fegota, the total attack, began."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past twenty days, all troops Only one-third of the combat supplies are available. Those saved can finally be put into use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you feel even a sense of guilt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of green hair is light Asked, I don’t answer, but I stretched out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I sometimes suspect that you are only using illusions to induce my dual personality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Renee stood up and stretched out and threw the order at the first staff desk to come to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She strode across the threshold and disappeared into the sun outside the staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;July 19, 1666 mday+109, the capital of the Republic of the Union, Lenny<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The young soldiers opened their eyes and woke up naturally from their sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What time is it??"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He yawns and picks up the pocket watch on the pillow It is found that the sun should have risen already. This fact made him sleepy. Naimen? Soledon got a slamming up from the bed and rushed out the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When is the wake up number? Is the garrison being dropped?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside It was a quiet courtyard and bright sunshine, and the people who were talking in the yard looked at him blankly. Almost for a moment, he recognized this place - the St. Grace Welfare Home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has spent more than a decade of life here. Then he remembered that he was actually on vacation, and that his vacation was earned by his troops with iron and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne Sefer has a military file bag on his shoulder and is chatting with Sister Wei Lun in the yard. The eyes of the two stayed on him as if they could hear a light snicker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, the army's pajamas are not so good, Sorelton."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nun After a moment of gaze on the vest on the door, she smiled with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie did not echo her and directly brought the topic to the topic. "Don't forget today's business, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door looked down at his own dress, turned back and slammed into the door. I began to change my uniform in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After vacation is not peaceful..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every soldier is eager to go back Rest, so that they feel that they have a safe distance from death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the Lenny Army, of course, earned it themselves. In the past two weeks, the Lenny and the Southwest have fought bravely under adversity. They have recovered all the territory of the West Bank of the Deer River, as well as 166 villages and towns in the area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time you saw Lenny, it was still four months ago. At that time, this unit was also called the "Fifth Nationalist" and took on a seemingly hopeless task: to participate in the suppression of the northern rebellion with the power of a militia. But in the next few months, the situation has changed dramatically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the troops became the "Sixth Freedom Division" in April, the "Steelburg Temporary Army" in May, and the "Western Total" in June. The Army of the Army, participated in almost all the battles in the war. The newspaper has been filled with the magical battle history of this unit, and the book titled "The Hundred and Twenty Days of Miracles" by the author of Bruto Luther has been reprinted three times in just two weeks. "Steelburg Conqueror", "Kingle Iron Wall", "Lenny Guardian" Bruto Luther became a hot hero, plus the noise of his own faction in the parliament, this "Rulk The heroic light shining on the man has already passed over Clade Lopez. Many politicians have begun to discuss the results of the parliamentary elections that must be held after the war, and look forward to the future of Luther Lopez, the war hero combination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near the door, don’t take your own new collar, then open your own backpack and flip through the medals and battle chapters that are lost inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troops returned to Lenny to rest, and everyone got the honor they deserved. The Supreme Council did not succumb to the reward of this heroic unit. The rewards and medals flocked to the unit like raindrops. No one knows how the parliament completed the design and enchantment of so many medals in just a few weeks. He silently picked up another piece of medal, not on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two third-class freedom medals for outstanding performance, one second-class freedom medal obtained when bravely intercepting the emperor, two representing the injured blood star The medal, as well as the identification of the staff and the identification of the junior magic officer. The Battle Chapter series begins with the largest fifth free war chapter, followed by the Lenny Peace Rebel Campaign Chapter, the Fortified Fortified Battle of Fort Worth, the Battle of Kengal Rebellion, the Revenge Battle of Kengal, Steele Fortress regained the battle chapter, and the latest morning dew campaign chapter. Of course, the two new, fiery captains are essential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknowingly, the rookie mage who did nothing has become a shining star in the Free Army. When the emperor is annihilated, it is not a problem to mix a major or even a lieutenant colonel. In the Free Army, the Lieutenant Colonel is the culmination of the executive staff, who can really take charge of the advance and retreat positions of the troops. The earliest meaning of this term is "frontline commander." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door hesitated for a moment and put the last piece of the badge he just got. The badge of the Free Army Military Law Committee, a badge consisting of a musket and a balance. This means that he has the right to become a military law enforcement officer and a military court juror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today he has to hang this chapter. He took two steps in front of the mirror and cleared his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Chief of Staff of the Lenni Army Staff of the Western Army, Captain Soleton, served as a juror at the invitation of the Free Trade Commission I swear to perform my duties based on justice and justice. Um... Sounds good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young erected the hair and pushed the door Into the sunny yard. The medallion on the chest undoubtedly reveals his purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister Weilun lifted his chin and looked at the medal on his chest with a mother-like look: "Very good, you have never worn a medal before." Why, today is going to a date, or to deceive an ignorant girl? With so many medals, half of the unmarried girls of Lenny will be fascinated, you say yes, Anne?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The nun patted the shoulder of the female lieutenant. Anne had been calculating the number of medals on Soleton's chest, and was caught off guard by such a shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, yes. No, no. Sorry... What did you say to Ms. Weilun?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Sister Wei Lun laughed heartily. "Others will be gone. You are also fascinated by the adjutant who meets him every day? Don't you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the nun, the more excited, the more flustered Arguing: "I don't have this intention at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, isn't your intention to hang on your chest?" The nun took two steps. He took care of his collar and lowered his voice. "Go. Don't make a foreign appearance in a military court. It's obvious that you are on the side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The forearm of the door is crossed in front of you, forming a casual military ceremony: "Do not worry, I will guarantee Mr. Kaikawi is not guilty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Although the words are so full, he has no confidence in his heart. Among the representatives of the jury, the army is one less than the navy, and the outcome seems to depend on the representatives of the political and religious circles. The views of these people are very different, and he does not know who will join the jury. To influence these people, I am afraid I still have to rely on the general trend of public opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now Lenny’s public opinion is not so good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking with Annie, Lenny is in a bustling market, and neither of them has any dating-like mood. When the people around him see the medals on his chest, they will cast a proper awe, and quietly let the two open the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The free country does not theoretically have a government agency called the Admiralty, whose navy is administered by the Parliamentary Sea Trade Commission. Similarly, the Navy does not have a formal military court. Their trial venue is located in the ruling hall of the Fortuna Cathedral, the goddess of fate, all in the name of the Sea Trade Commission. At the time of their trial, they also specially invited representatives of the army, church and parliament to conduct jury trials, showing that they are a democratic navy. For the sake of efficiency, a jury without a civil trial is so democratic, only a simple majority decides guilty or not guilty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this does not affect the harshness of the free naval military law. Half of the regulations in the "Regulations on the Regulation and Protection of Maritime Trade" are terminated by the "death penalty". The Commission uses this cruel way to govern ships that have been assembled from all corners of the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several civic organizations gathered in the square at the entrance of the church. A group of organizations on the left shouted "Knocking off the escape" and "restricting military power". The slogan, three women who lost their loved ones in the coup, stood at the forefront of the team, and with a few war orphans, screamed in tears to accuse the atrocities of the out-of-control army. The organizations on the right side are slogans such as "Republic is a human republic" and "Elves are rolling back to the forest." These people sort out a list of all the ships that have been sunk by the Sunshine Navy for a hundred years. The voices sang the medieval ballads that responded to the elves’ oppression. Since the sacrificial treaty attack by Sansen, the anti-elf has become a fashion, and the strength of these organizations has also grown rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the door was silenced for a while, he also thought of the key. "And, they still have the main force of the invincible Red Fleet. The throwing out of Mr. Kaikawi will calm the public's anger at failure; when the main force arrives, they can use the power of this fleet to snatch credit... The Navy will beat the hero into a traitor before the dust settles at all costs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s right."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice suddenly came in and gently slammed. The two cast their eyes on it and saw a familiar figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now some people think that we have reached the best time to negotiate. The old fox feels that we should express our position and send me to fill the number. The two bosses of the year are so badly to deal with." Colonel Hull Tedwood shrugged his shoulders and expressed his position to them. "The three representatives of the Army are all consistent."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can Marshal Fox not come?" Nanimen hurriedly asked, "Maybe his influence can change the big picture..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp The Colonel shook his head and shook his head: "It's not suitable. If Marshal Fox personally goes out, it will become a decisive battle between the Navy and the Army. There are some people in the Parliament who have a lingering fear of the military. Do your best." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the first preparation bell rang. The three men walked to the seats prepared for themselves and looked at the situation inside the church and the companions around them. The distribution of the observers was not very optimistic. Some people were obviously members of the opposition organizations who had previously been outside the church. They wanted to play banners in the court, but they were blocked by the bailiff. As for the companions who are also jurors... The four men in the Navy seem to be looking like "guilty", and the remaining three members and two priests seem to be mixed with each other. The only thing that makes people feel at ease is the lineup of defense lawyers on the defendant's side, both in terms of number and quality, which are significantly stronger than the other Navy's complaints officers. The three complaints officers, under the guidance of more than a dozen barristers, seem to be a bit thin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A good lawyer's team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the sigh of the door, Anne smiled I licked my hair: "The order of the hostess, at any cost, no way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The pure gold must be analyzed and defeated. Is there a loophole in the law?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annies lowered his voice: "From the naval regulations, there is no victory. The regulations have always been known for being harsh. And there are plenty of cases to prove 'nothing is accommodating'. Our basic strategy is to start with a variety of more advanced legal and practical purposes, citing the examples of previous free wars. If public opinion is on our side If there is, there should be a chance of winning..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a cold in the door, I don’t know what to respond to. With the support of such a luxurious lawyers group, they can only use this method of delaying tactics. The situation can be said to be very pessimistic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every day there are people who are sacrificing for the country. The northern front line is fifteen days away. The eastern front line is twenty-five days away. In seven The front line of Fort Worth outside the hour."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door? Soleton’s finger subconsciously slammed the holster of the revolver and told himself to calm down. . This occasion is not appropriate to show your thoughts on the face. The position of the jury is not so good, it is even harder to sit on behalf of the Army. He whispered to the reality in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People are trying to judge those who have not yet sacrificed for the country, accusing them of not being good enough on the front line..."<br /><br /> At this point, the judge’s order interrupted their discussion: “Then, the third meeting of the Free Sea Trade Commission’s Inland River Fleet’ case began. The complainant and the defender are ready. "There are no questions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are also ready." The lawyers of the lawyers replied. However, the position of the first lawyer closest to the judge is still empty, which is very unsightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge also noticed this unsightly fact that the law in his hand was heavy and his tone sounded a bit bad: "What is your chief lawyer? I haven't got his name and information yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the lawyer still a big man? I don't care if he has any important matters. If he doesn't attend the court on time, he will defy the court!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another barrister is not in a hurry Added: "Sorry, but in theory, this is a ruling meeting of the Haimao Commission. It is not late in the court, but for the parliament, it is not a problem to get there before half of the process." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge did not know how to refute it for a while, and the momentum faded a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I will wait for him for half an hour. Please ask the complainant to present the case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The offensive and defensive actions of both sides immediately revolved around the identification of the facts of the case and the situation. The large and small cases in which the free country has been established for centuries have been dug up. What is unexpected is that the defense party has made a fuss about the changes in the naval regulations, and found a lot of similar "ups and downs", "escape and reorganization". Such definitions are ambiguous words. As a last resort, the complainant had to present a large number of historical and even foreign cases to explain the shamefulness of Leonard Kikawi’s actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a strategy we set? I think this has had a very bad impact on us..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is used by the corners of the eye to look at those members. Obviously, they prefer to listen to the lively cases, not the rules that the barristers play with. Someone whispered, "This is not a slap in the face." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne seems to have some surprises: "Oh, this thing is my sister's responsibility, she has a lawyer's license... I don't know their strategy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was suppressed and worried, and continued to work hard to exchange views with the two members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle between the two sides is getting more and more fierce, and the voice of "I object" and the table is one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The complainant believes that since the maritime trade management and protection regulations are not specifically designed to define the state of naval warfare, we believe that historical warfare should be used in specific naval battle situations. Assess the facts of this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... In other words, the complainant believes that the description of the regulations should not be used to define the facts, right?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But after the facts are determined, we must decide the penalty by regulation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judges originally He is a retired captain and he is getting more and more impatient. He suddenly remembered the chief counsel, and this thing seemed to be more interesting than the boring clause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s been half an hour. May I ask the defense, is your chief lawyer here? If you haven’t arrived yet, there is no suitable reason, I will take him. The position was removed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time as the sentence was exported, the door was pushed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, it seems to be catching up. I heard it outside the door. Do you need a reason for the judge?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sound of the collision of the door panels, a ray of light casts on the aisle from the court door to the trial seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first reason, there were three frictions with the Emperor this morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; A shadow cast in this beam of light, attracting everyone's eyes to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The second reason, in order to cut off the connection between the left and the military of the Imperial Guards, I am arranging a march."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier in a plain military uniform carries the general's epaulette on his shoulder. He didn't bring any medals because he didn't need it at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The third reason, in order to protect the city, I need to arrange a defense plan when I am not present. Because of the naval of Leonard Kikawi Will not be there, this program is a lot more complicated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The badge of the balance of the man’s chest is shiny, and the whole person seems to be immersed in the amazing light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the trial is a war, then this is an impressive decisive raid. The atmosphere in the jury has undoubtedly produced a deflection, even if the judge’s crazy voice can not reverse this trend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord Luther!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lenny Defender!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Steelberg Conqueror!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Free Heroes! Long Live Free Hero!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of General Luther’s performance, there is no doubt that there is only one. He wants to make himself and Lenard stand together and maximize the depth of the audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is difficult to break through the law and public opinion, it will be fine to run them directly. If anyone wants to oppose him, then consider whether to be an enemy of the hero of a free country. If this thing is displayed too early, those hostile political forces will certainly be able to think of a smear; but now they are too late to conceive a plan of action and are overwhelmed by the will of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge tapped the law in a panic: "You... are you qualified as a lawyer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, I got it before I took office - don't you know this thing, judge adult?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther replied, in his own chief The lawyer sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next half hour, the defensive team began to fight back, and the previous case was pointed out by one A flaw that does not match the emergency. The complainants apparently did not prepare to be counterattacked again, and they fell into temporary chaos like their supporters. Bruto Luther personally went on the battle, which put a lot of pressure on the complainants who were active naval officers - after all, it was a general. Originally intended to stay in the final emotional offensive, had to start in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the long run, you will destroy the foundation of our country's founding!" The complainant finally threw out the killer, "The reason why the Freedom Navy can Four Seas, it is because the flag never retreats! We seize the hurdle, we keep the front, we never retreat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the long run, all People are dying." Bruto Luther’s counterattack is simple and sharp. "If we lose Lenny, in the long run, the republics are also going to perish. As an army, I can only trust. The fleet. I only know that if we let the enemy go to transport, you, me and the bodies in the room may have rotted. Do you have any other questions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The complainants have not had time to reply, and there is a shout of shouting in the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Innocent! Innocent! Not guilty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cry of the people overwhelmed the judge Law, it took only five or six minutes to calm down. This silence was not because the authority of the judge was finally restored, but because the second uninvited guest broke into the court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is a commander. He looked very anxious and ordered the bullets like a shotgun to pour out: "General Luther! The enemy on the front line launched the largest and largest magic cover, and launched a fierce counterattack! We have lost in the past day. More than 20 strongholds, more than 1,200 soldiers, the battleline returned to the situation five days ago! The Marshal Fox of the Freedom Command of the General Command crossed the Lenny Army Staff and asked everyone to return to their own in the shortest possible time. "On the post!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Calm, soldier, calm. It’s just a drill before dying." Luther didn't stand up, his hands crossed. It seems to be full of confidence. "But the Figota public rushed over, they have to do some smoke screens! What are the fears of these far-sighted troops? We have plans, yes, Captain Soledon. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time, Nami felt like a mainstay. He couldn’t take back the plan he had made before his vacation. "Yes, Lord General."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our material reserves are also ready, right? Lieutenant Sefer?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Lord General. All material centers have been transferred to the west side within fifteen days." Annie looked at her sister with a smile on her face. In terms of a commander, confidence and mystery are the most important things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
