			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xviii<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Standard Calendar June 12, 1665, Sacred Sailing in Emerald Bay The Mori anti-private ship "Kleon Emperor" was attacked by pirates and suffered heavy losses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the battle, secretly boarding the ship's Principality of Soma The first successor, Lord Ferdinand, was killed in an accident. The reason why he took the Elf battleship was because there was no navy in the inland Soma Principality. The death of Lord Ferdinand led to the death of the Soma Principality loyal to the Holy Coman Empire. It can only be postponed to the other two side heirs. These two heirs are the Earl of Maison, the son of the Duke of Noel, and the Holy Emperor Gustav; Hugh; Coman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The news of the death of the Lord shocked the entire human world. Since all of the Coman Guards and the Principality of the Principality died in battle, Sansen could not explain the accident to the Holy Coman Empire, but had to ship it. The commander removed his job; this buried the discord between the two countries. Shadow. The dispute between the emperor and the aristocratic faction in the sacred empire immediately surfaced. The dispute was entangled for half a year, and the two sides reluctantly reached a new inheritance agreement, but the agreement was full of compromises and unrealistic terms." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Ferdinand assassination became one of the fuses of the chaotic world in the near future..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The above paragraph is quoted from the 1893 edition of The Modern History of Akragna, Volume 5, The Age of Elves' Decline and Enlightenment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History should have evolved like this, but with minor deviations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lenard; Kakawi, the famous naval general of the artillery sailing era. He served as the captain of the Nassau Naval Sea Fleet, the captain of the Inner Sea Fleet, and the Sixth Fleet of the Inner Sea. Commander, after leaving St. Mori, became a famous pirate on both seas. As the commander of the Coman Joint Fleet, he was defeated by the two-column column in the heart of Lu Xinhai. The main force of the inner sea fleet led by Admiral Gillas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The historian of the future generations should have recorded this. But now he is dead." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butterfly began to fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leisha; Helmont just stepped onto the last step leading to the lower deck of the artillery, and saw a black figure flying fast towards the upper deck. Go running. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alchemist took out his golden scepter and blocked it on the way of the brown-haired girl: "Bonnie! Stay!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I am in a hurry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie; Seifer rushed to answer, but accelerated the pace, did not stop the meaning of. Her cheeks were reddish because of the intense movement, but the look was still so calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bonnie!" Reza frowned: she had to shoot. "Long whip form!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden whip flower emerged from the scepter in her hand, forming a gorgeous golden whip wall in the narrow corridor. There are two forms of Reza's "automatic chain whip". The long whip is both offensive and defensive, and the chain form is heavy on the attack. The common feature is automatic operation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown-haired girl paused and said, "What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, you are also a mage?" Leisha said, the tone was extraordinarily indifferent. "You are actually a chess piece."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing the tears of Reza, Bonnie slammed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to have to tell the truth... The answer to the first question is 'yes'. The answer to the second question is 'no' "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lisa's eyebrows are picking up, the tone is cold like ice. "It’s a good idea. One is reckless and rash, one is quiet and gentle, and the age is small... You really deceived the whole boat. Are you satisfied now?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Sorry, Ms. Reza, we really don't have any malice. Now I have a very urgent thing, I have to go to the deck, please let me pass!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown-haired girl sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I have to offend. wallice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete Can't see, Bonnie's soft and small hands can use magic skills so skillfully and accurately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ice wall accurately circulates the dancing whip shadows of Reza - and then solidifies! The whip flowers that fluttered in the sky disappeared at once, leaving only a helpless golden whip, standing alone in the ice wall and struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you practice in the cold field? It’s really clever!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately loosened his weapon and took out the blazing rubber from his pocket, ready to burn the ice wall. Alchemists have a lot of experience in dealing with the trembling mage in the cold field. After all, the cold domain is a very common area of ​​attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has just pulled out the blazing rubber, and the boxing has appeared in front of her eyes! Bonnie accurately hit the flask in the hands of Reza, and the flask fell into the ground with the blazing glue and shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How could it be... How did she pass the ice wall?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately after the three steps back, I noticed Bonnie; the figure of Sefer was hidden in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is...what is this magic? Why have I never heard of it? It looks like a ghost..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bhen she tried to recognize the magic, Bonnie had already flew forward and crossed her side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well! Ionet, stop her!" The alchemist shouted at the priest who had just climbed up the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow the Taiwanese life. Deformation, big sword!" The chief bishop closed the gun, and the silver giant sword reappeared in his hands. "Break the evil!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's be merciful, don't kill her!" Reshua remembered the amazing power of the previous one, and hurriedly reminded the chief bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that is already late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver light immediately illuminates all the dark corners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The momentum of that glimpse is like taking out the ship; it is real, pure power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"mage‘s sword.” The calm voice of the brown-haired girl rang under the glare of silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No extra nonsense, just a spell. The silver light that illuminates the entire room is extinguished in half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver-handed sword was firmly blocked by a sinister sword; the silver light that it exudes is also blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one that blocks the silver light is a phantom sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible??!" The chief bishop has an unbelief. From becoming a clergyman to now, Ionite; Hartman has been smooth sailing, and no one can block him holding the "covenant arbiter." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sword, will be blocked by a girl who is no more than 18 years old? This is impossible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The serious expression of the brown-haired girl is slightly loose: "You are Nopp... No, Ionet; Hartman?!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know me?" Ionette surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie smiled: "Oh, of course. I know you, you are famous..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The sword in the girl’s hand turned, and a huge gravitation brought Ionite’s sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, I am in a hurry now, I really have to go. dimension door!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of magic is that...?" Io asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know. Her magic is quite strange, I have never seen it." Reza frowned, taking another bottle of fire from her arms. Glue melted the ice wall and rescued his own weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where did she go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She should want to go to the deck... The alchemist slammed his hand. "I understand! She wants to meet her sister! We catch up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifteenth century is a pioneering century. The sixteenth century was the century of religious reform. The seventeenth century is a century of cultural exchange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western culture and Eastern culture are intertwined in a series of events. The thoughts of enlightenment and the anti-enlightenment thoughts collide in the trend of the times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-term accumulation, sparkling in the second half of the century. Is it necessary to preserve the existing brilliant civilization? Still in the midst of turmoil and bloodyness, moving towards a new era of new spiritual integration? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People seek the path to advance in the struggle, which is the 30 years of the storm. After that, they built a huge new civilization based on reason - that is an unstoppable civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world, the spirit determines the power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butterfly has begun to fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf's body was forced to fall forward on the ground, and the red blood flowed out of his chest, soaking the nearby deck. The murderer stood behind his body and held a knife in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s so fast, it’s really..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie; Seifer will The knife was thrown heavily on the ground, making a "beep" sound. She bit her lip and her face was very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the time was stunned and shocked by this sudden change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What have you done!" The stunner is the pirate captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This scene, I argue that it is useless?" The blonde girl slowly dismissed her arm shield from her left arm and answered with a smile. "Let's go together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kazmi, who used to be rampant, immediately angered her attitude: "You...! Witch, die!" Wind cut and knife!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no plans to pity Xiangxi. The scope of his knives ranged from oblique to oblique, and he vowed to let this woman who used the despicable means to assassinate Leonard's death to be terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade rubs the scabbard and gives a harsh "brush", and the scabbard is immediately shredded by the vacuum attribute attached to the knife! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the momentary explosive force, a blade of light with the murderousness that makes everyone back away from the house, and flies straight to the blonde girl! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of this knife is unbeatable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This knife has reached the limit, coupled with the knife-drawing technique, the speed has been captured by the human eye! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insidious and sinister female killer has not responded, it was cut by the knife, the blood is too late to flow out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirate captain slowly spit out a long breath and took back his knife. The blond girl's upper body slanted down, and the bloody red viscous liquid slowly oozes out from the slit of the black leather armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire deck was quiet, and there was no sound. It seemed that everyone was shocked by his knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kezmi’s heart is also slightly proud. Killing people without seeing blood is not the highest state of "speed"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before he was satisfied, a familiar voice came from behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Kezmi stunned, the voice was clearly the girl who had become a two-way girl - the source of the sound, behind his back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirate captain turned sharply, the blonde's Annie; Seifer stood in the middle of the deck with a confident smile on his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have said, I am not an enemy... Can we not fight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You..." Katzmi couldn't speak for a while. At the moment of the knife extraction, the illusion was completed, indicating that she had already counted that someone would attack her position. Moreover, I did not know what method, and I returned to the center of the crowded deck... This is also a terrible opponent, no matter what standard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it possible with her age? How can this be? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kill!" At the mouth of Katzmi, all the seamen and pirates raised their weapons and swarmed to the blond girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No way. Fly!" Anne; Seifer sighed and slammed her left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a small white light wing suddenly appearing behind the blonde girl, her body flew up and stayed in a place where the crowd was not high. The afternoon sun, gently spread on the transparent light wings, makes it look extraordinarily sacred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Angel!" Someone called out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't hold it, shoot at the witch! She is just a witch!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kai With a slap in the face, several quick-responding pirates burst into pistols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde girl frowned slightly, and a transparent, slightly white cloak was sown outside her leather armor. All the lead shots hit the cloak and bounced off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"circleholding person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girly lips floating in the air Micro-opening, a faint shadow ring immediately enveloped the entire deck of the "Dano". Anne; Seifer hands gently to the next shot, including Kazmi; everyone, including Stewart, can't move at all. The pirate captain struggled with all his strength and wanted to get rid of this set-up magic, but it didn't work at all: the power of the surgeon was so powerful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I really don't have any hostility to you. Otherwise, I won't use this kind of magic that will not cause harm. As for the endgame here. Someone will soon pick up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde girl slid quietly with a breeze, and the translucent cloak flew in the trade wind. She quietly put away the wings behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kazmi tried his best to speak: "You...what are you sacred?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie chuckles: "I am a historian...ah, and he is also the savior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All plans, in the face of enemies Time will expire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All conspiracy will change during actual execution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible to control the world through conspiracy and planning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how detailed they are, how complicated, how to succeed, how to be sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the butterfly has begun to fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious light green door floats in the center of the "Dano" deck, and another girl in a tight black leather armor comes out of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s late, Bonnie." Anne was somewhat dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I have encountered some minor problems." Bonnie quietly smiled and described the Excalibur of the New World Parish as "small trouble". “However, I met someone you would definitely be interested in.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啪", the blond girl stretched out her right hand, and the brown-haired girl's right hand gently rubbed in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't throw me the mess again? What are you going to do?" Bonnie asked her sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s also a little troublesome, and it’s been accidentally calculated.” After that, Anne lightly skipped the pedal leading to the “Kleon Emperor”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, be careful on the road, my sister!" The brown-haired girl smiled and waved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to the warm dialogue of these two sinister and sinister "girls", the people around them almost spurt fire. Among them, the most angry is Kazmi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still... still a little! This little magic is compared to the time when you learned art, what counts...!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirate captain tried his best to mobilize the limits of his own spirit, imagining the most painful ** and mental torture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To break through! Be sure to break through! Be sure to break this limit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he felt his left hand move slightly. He couldn't believe it, and tried it again - his right hand moved a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knife is still in his hands. He has a chance. He glanced at Leonard's body and strengthened his will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stabilize. Keep it steady. Just seize the opportunity and you can avenge your ......" Katzmi muttered in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Bonnie turned her head and smiled at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good willpower. Can rely on willpower to lift my sister's body, you are also very great."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kezmi surprised: How did she find out? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he has no time to think! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind cut!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the third time in the day Shot - the last shot. The magic attached to the knife is only enough for him to use three vacuum wind cuts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are unsuccessful, you will become a man! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"resilient sphere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the faintness on Bonnie's face The smile, the cool curse sounded. A blue, elastic, massive energy ball that completely encloses the pirate captain. The last time the wind cut and slammed on the outer wall of the energy ball, it did not cause a little response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods..." The pirate who had been eager for enmity and fearless, unable to kneel on his knees, the samurai sword in his hand slowly slideed down . "Why, do you want to tear the good things to people? Just to create a tragedy and entertain the world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reason why God created tragedy is because of vulgarity The world loves tragedy. There is nothing more comfortable than watching other people’s tragedies and tears for others.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing his words, Bonnie I dismissed the next comment and went to the body of Leonard. She crouched down and explored the half-elf's breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really dead...but the body is complete, otherwise I can’t do it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;She held her chin and thought about it with her head in her head. This action looks pretty cute - but it is not the case for observers not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Arcane! A strong magician!" Ionet; Hartman frowned. "They...they are the men of Machiavelli? This is a big problem..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reshua was shocked: "You mean... ... even if you are the strongest pastor of the New World, you can't be sure to defeat them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like Machiavelli, the genius of creating new magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe stronger than that man... even Machiavelli’s magic has its theory The context can be found. But the witch's magic is completely absent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resa sighed angrily: "She, they have deceived me for so long!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Ionite was busy stopping her outburst, "She has action again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown-haired girl stood by Leonard for a moment and then gestured using magic. This time, Ionite is quite familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inner magic...but this magic is...how is it possible?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What should I do if I need absolutely pure magical energy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Absolutely pure magical energy... In fact, can you try the magical wind? It is absolutely pure The magical energy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fantasy? Is the difficulty too high?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, no one knows what that energy can be used for..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you can change the world?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, the butterfly has begun to fly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie quietly kneels, hands on Leonard’s body was on the shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are blessed by God because of our faith. God's blessing is only because of our faith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Her body glows with holy white light, as if there is a divine power overflowing from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God is unknowable, but God's will is known. God exists to serve our devout faith and to give us eternal salvation "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White light as if in response to a girl's prayer, gradually spread along her arms and her hands to the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is she doing?" Reza couldn’t help but ask her pastor, "What evil magic?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...not...but this is impossible..." Ionet; Hartman seems to have suffered a considerable shock, "She is a pastor of reform sects." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? Didn’t you just say that she is a mage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is sure It’s still a Protestant pastor. It’s not unusual, and there are rare people who have arcane and magical skills, but there are always...but...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But she is using resurrection." Ionet’s voice was slightly trembling, it was due to extreme shock, "although the ceremony The technique, performance, and performance are completely different, but I can be sure that it is resurrection. The orthodox church took a thousand or two years to complete the great magic, resurrection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; She so much? You would not be the resurrection? "Leisha curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't, but this question is not important." Seems to be poked, Ionite smiled a bit. "The important thing is... Protestant fundamentally There is no resurrection, they have no complete treatment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clever as Reza, immediately understood the key: "That is... Does she use magic that does not exist at all? Are you sure that Protestantism has no secret to complete the resurrection?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette nodded solemnly: "It is impossible We almost monitored every senior priest of Protestantism."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Bonnie; Sefer's resurrection magic is complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
