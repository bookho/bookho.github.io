The artillery unit lost half of its strength, and the fragments of the twenty-four-pound gun were scattered. Almost all gunpowder reserves are consumed in this trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it suffered such a large loss, the cheers of the emperor sounded like a cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Long live the Emperor! Long live the Holy Empire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cheers rush into the door? Captain Leiden’s mind made him stunned. Until now, this news has also been very unreal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible. Lieutenant Sefer is so strong... This is impossible. She must have a solution. From the perspective of combat power deduction... We won't lose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is whether he is judged by the experience of the combat staff, or because of emotional bias, he does not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black mushroom cloud is still floating in the air, and the huge "Star of the Sea" magic group has indeed begun to get out of control. Water droplets and starlight lost their color, scattered randomly in the morning sun, and slowly descended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do I need to do... telescope, telescope." The doorman began to groped on the armed belt, only to remember that his telescope had long been lost. In the chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door quickly walked to the side of the first line of defense defeated by Anne, kneeling down and looking for those bodies. This line of defense is one of the most devastating forces, second only to the fourth line of defense, which is almost completely destroyed. He knows that there must be officers in charge of reconnaissance, and they must have telescopes in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, what can you do is to turn over the body here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind It feels like it is back. No one is in control of him now, but Kelly still hears the indifferent voice and the sneering sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to use magic, but even if you beg her to waste time teaching you, you still can't learn."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door turned out of a telescope, but found it was broken by Anne's magic, helplessly thrown aside, continue to move down a corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This emotion is a "powerless feeling." You can't use the powerless power of magic. In the ensuing misfortunes and disasters, there is nothing to do with the powerlessness. No matter what you do, you can't change the situation. No matter what you do, you are dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You feel that you are very smart, and you will be tempted, right? You feel that you mix well no matter where you are, right? But what did you do?" What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a complete monocular on the fourth body. Naimeng took it and looked at the other end of the mushroom cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe she is not dead," he replied himself. "And I also believe that since I am here, there is something I can do." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Emperor is immersed in false excitement, he is the first to see the battle on the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***-***-***-***-***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the top of the four gates of the East Ends<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of forging magic weapons in the civilized world is at least four or five thousand years old. Among all the weapons known as "artifacts", the omnipotent scepter "power" is probably one of the most famous, second only to the "prime star" that has not yet appeared in this history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magical scepter is a symbol of the succession of the second dynasty of the Holy Coman Empire. Whether in history books, myths, legends or novels, the inheritance tokens of other countries were appointed by the founding emperor. It is not easy for the world to follow, and no one dares to change it easily - but this "power" is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a generation of emperors died, the new successor emperor will add his own logo, emblem and circuit to the "power", which will be new in these years. The progress of magic technology is engraved. The first thing that every new emperor has to do is to decide his own emblem and what new magic to add to the scepter. Although the number of each magic is only one area, some of the magic will mutually repel each other, but the total amount of magic on the entire scepter is comparable to the highest magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the conviction of the sacred king of the sacred Koman empire: "power is power." In order to gain strength, the Koman emperors are not afraid to change any tradition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when this scepter is handed over to others, it means that the person has the enormous power of the entire sacred empire. Only in the midst of a crisis of crisis, the “power” will be awarded to the best courtiers of the empire. This kind of thing happened five or six times in total in the history of the second dynasty. No one had thought that after a few months of hard work, the battle of Lenny's siege actually fell to the end of the emperor's appointment of the Prime Minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the scepter was received by the Duke of Loren von Figota, after three free wars and the two emperors’ names; The empire forced this to the point, but it was just an insignificant female lieutenant. Before she appeared, Lenny seemed to have been compromised - and now, the entire imperial chain of command has completely collapsed, and even the chief commander has to personally enter the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if you lost the entire heavy artillery unit, you could not stop the witch..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Even the old duke who has fought in battle can't help but feel a guilty heart. The artillery fire of the empire has already slammed into the parliament building, and all the gates of the city have been opened, but this is still the case. Is this war going to fall short? It’s like singing in their national anthem. The gods will bless them to unite and freedom. Is the four-color cross flag really going to fly for a long time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not believe. The first Duke of the Figota family was once a military historian of the founding emperor of the Holy Empire. The Dukes of all ages were famous for their knowledge and glory. But even if they rummaged through all the history books, there would be no wise men who never made mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful magic requires the help of magical skills, and more troops need to be commanded to be used. No one can make mistakes. All that is needed for victory is the mistake of catching each other. The old duke has been waiting patiently, waiting until the other party's strength and self-confidence have come to an end, and the moment when the enemy is wrong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he finally waited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you don't want to talk about it. Just like this, let us end the war directly here."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witch with the dazzling blonde said so, falling slowly from the air. Even if there is no need to detect spells, the old duke knows that she is bound with a variety of intensive spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she’s falling too slowly, it’s too slow, slow enough to be the target of most magic. For so long, the witch has never left the ground and has not relied on the auxiliary magic. But she finally got into the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old duke left the useless commanding sword "benevolent", the world's sharpest sword directly inserted into the wall tiles, only revealing three points The second sword is outside. He pulled out the "power", his fingers stroked the magic circuit above and found the magic he needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"absolutedispel". The strongest of all the dispelling magic, even the user himself will be affected, so the general high-level wizard will not use this magic that causes great damage to both sides to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old duke did not hesitate to press, the jewel at the top of the "power" lighted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the magic on Annie suddenly disappeared without a trace. She screamed in a short moment and accelerated down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Fegota knew that such an attack would not bring victory. The "power" in his hand slanted downward and pressed another magical gem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"earthpike!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack on both sides is tightly linked . For opponents who are fast-falling, of course, use the sharp ground that maximizes damage. At the height of Anne's fall, this less powerful magic will become a life-saving blade that can wear her whole person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the prospect of becoming a barbecue on the obsidian sign, the general mage may choose to strengthen the defense and then smash it, or re-use the flight to fly in the air. But Anne will never choose the countermeasures that will make her lose speed. She knew that there was a powerful wide-area attack magic hidden in the weapon. She did not hesitate to make a rather advanced spell - it was too extravagant to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reverse Gravity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but even this is experienced old In the calculation of the Duke. He can't be positioned accurately, but it can slow down the opponent's speed. At the crucial moment of this magical duel, slow one minute and one second will not work. As long as one spell is slowed down, the opponent may replenish all the intensified magic, and he will never have any chance of winning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"forcecage!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge force field of the birdcage shape In front of Anne's flight route. Instead of choosing a defense, the Duke chose to limit the range of activities of his opponent. He has a number in his heart, and the witch is afraid to approach the emperor's side. Such a high-ranking mage, it is impossible to not know the blood of the royal family. As long as it is human, no one can ask for cheapness in the melee from the Komans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the flying blonde girl lieutenantly stopped the car, but the back and arms still hit the force field, it looks like Leaves a long bruising blemish on her skin. At the moment of stopping, she also threw her own counterattack magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Continuous laser (burstlaser)!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three cluster beams are accurately played in the Duke Gold breastplate. Regrettably, two of them were stopped by the armor, and only one beam passed through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This laser penetrates the veteran's lungs, but it is nothing to the Duke of War. He bit his teeth, swallowed a blood from his throat, and smiled: the second mistake. He waited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in the distance, watching the fierce battle with a telescope, the door was exclaimed: "Counter? What are you thinking, Anne, first Speed ​​is added up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is already late. The experience of Loren von Figota does not allow him to miss such an opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old duke saw the high morale below and hesitated. His hand involuntarily released the gem that he had intended to press and moved it over another gem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t use the magic that is too noisy, let the following emperor find the battle here, the old duke thinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no confidence to use this magic to kill the powerful witch, even if it is the most powerful attack magic on the entire "power" "crushing" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wave)". If this magic is used to win, the morale of the emperor will be hit hard again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hesitation, only this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, everything has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Military Affairs suddenly smelled a woman’s unique body fragrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell of bloody fragrance is fascinating and close at hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The laser magic is for the positioning of the transmission."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne’s voice sounds sweet, soft, and still with three points - but old The duke shuddered. He realized that the enemy is actually him. The witch did not make a mistake, and he made the mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, it was the sharp pain that came from the right wrist and the chin almost simultaneously. The grip of the witch was unexpectedly good. The old duke’s right wrist was twisted by her. The “power” fell into her hands, and a heavy hook shot flew out his golden helmet. The heavy helmet made of gold fell down the tower and rolled down on the ground, making a low sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is stunned in the distance. Even the emperor below, some people have discovered the battle here. The cheers stopped and the entire battlefield fell into silence. The power has changed hands, and the golden helmet rolls in the dust, and there is no more symbolic scene than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s over. It’s all over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower gums plunged into the captain of the old man, and the pain almost completely killed him. The military minister finally understood that he was no longer young, not the knight who was suffering from dozens of serious injuries and bloody battles. He bowed his head and carefully looked at the woman who forced herself and the entire empire into such a desperate situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thought that rushed into the mind of the old duke was: It’s a beautiful woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal-clear broken arm is especially beautiful. If I am twenty or thirty years old, for the sake of her betrayal of the empire, I am afraid I can do it too? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the white hair of the old duke, Anne stopped: "You are not an emperor?! That 'power'..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man coughed twice, and the tall body regained his straightness: "Even if you beat me, you can't catch down. Even the 'power' and 'benevolent' are in me. In your hand, you can't find him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the words blurted out, the old duke suddenly discovered the real mistake of the witch. It was a small mistake, but it was hidden deep. She didn't add defensive magic, and she didn't notice that the person in front of her was much more important than her own body - three times as much as the gold armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hugged a bear with his arms, hugged the girl in front of him and threw her to the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny was shocked. Being hugged by such an old man who was enough to be his grandfather, she did not know how to react: "You, what do you want to do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The modern social etiquette received from childhood Education overwhelmed her fighting instinct and prevented her from launching a fatal counterattack in the first place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the door that only observed the battle through the telescope in the distance changed: he also found the error. On the cruel battlefield, even a strong person will lose everything because of a mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Action, Annie! Kill him, immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very heavy boxing Playing in the belly of the old duke, almost broke his armor. Enduring the pain of the whole body, Loren von Figota gave a sigh of relief and smiled. He knows that he is gambling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hugged Annie and rolled over to the side! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Anne finally found out the mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Benevolence." It is "kindness"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp sword that is half-inserted is inserted in close proximity to the place-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp And the body of her and the old duke just rolled over from the blade! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sword is too sharp, so sharp that she has lost her legs and still has no feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie struggled to lift her gaze and saw her legs and the old duches’ legs staying close to the sword. She looked at her lower body again and saw that the cutting line was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old duke of Loren von Figota whispered, smiled gratifiedly, pressed the magic loop on the armor, and launched the last spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Firestorm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames enveloped the top of the entire wall. In this flame, the girl with only one right hand in her limbs also read the last spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Static field barrier (staticfield)!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old duke's body is in flames While burning the fly ash, the blue protective field quickly covered the girl's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this force field protection, no one can hurt her. The emperors who looked at this scene all stayed, and they didn't know how to act - the result of this battle was too much for their expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the other end of the battlefield, a monocular dropped to the ground and could no longer be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***-***-***-***-***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;破晓伦尼东四区<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***-***-***-***-*** <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenmen? Soledon threw the telescope heavily on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor may react at any time and rush to the tower, so that he and her all efforts will fall short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t know how six segments like the static field barriers – or seven segments – how long magic can last. But he knew that when Anne Sefer's magic was lifted, she needed someone to be by her side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic net is already trembling, and the huge magical group temporarily leaves the creator's control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the fucking 'someone'! She needs me, she needs me, she needs me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence repeatedly sounds in the mind of Naimen, sounds like a multi-voiced holy song. He knew that he shouldn't think so, he knew that he thought he was almost a bastard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But she needs me! And I know what I need! She needs me, bastard! Give me a move, my magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of the whole body is just around the corner, and it is resonating with the magic net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What I want is... true faith, knowledge and strength. What I want is... can protect the power of everything I love! Why is it? Can't catch it? Tell me, what else is it?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Need the power! Need the power of Magic Net, you know, she needs you now! You have to suppress the emperor who wants to move for her, suppress them all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the entire battlefield, only one person at the moment knows how the Magic Net works. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to control it. He knows he can control it. He believes he must control it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resonance." Nana suddenly thought of something, "Handshake. Why is this ceremony called a handshake, not a transaction or a request?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of etiquette is the handshake? An equal ceremony between strangers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because it is equal in the process? Is it equal to the huge magic net?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am equal to the Magic Net... there is no need to surrender to the Magic Net. There is no need to stick to your own point of view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closes his eyes and his right hand gently taps in the air. The magic net shook a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of thought experiments is very fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second handshake. I understand this objective world. But I also have my own subjective world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she needs me. Stretch out your right hand, extend your left hand, grab the magic net, and vow to fight to the end of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she needs me. I will stick to my beliefs, as long as my performance proves that it is correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she needs me. that's enough. I will change the reality for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third handshake. I will give everything until the end!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is resistance Door? The reality that Soledon expects. It’s not just about living, it’s not just drifting. He has something to do from the bottom of his heart - this is the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, I know, it knows, yes, magicarrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; A little white light flashed at his fingertips, flew out, hit the wall beside him, and broke a hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is open to the eye. His eyes brightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a zero-segment spell. So, I know part of it, it should also know... magicmissile?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time is a three-violet light bomb from the right middle finger to the little finger, hitting the array of strikers in the enemy's reorganization, and there are several screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three hairs. The number is more than mine. Next I want to find a technology that I know but not yet skilled...flamearrow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fire hole in the head of a guerrilla shooter on the side of the roof. The door was jumped off the horse and patted the horse's neck to make it mentally prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magic that I want to use... Fireball!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is fierce Turning around, he cast out the hot air mass in his right hand, and squatted on several imperial soldiers who tried to use melee to deal with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The last thing I don't know, but the technology it knows...that's good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The door is looking to the top of the gate at a distance, where the flame cyclone has not yet dispersed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what the magic name is, but let's call it firestorm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; That's the same magic as the old Duke's hot bodyguard flame. The flame surrounded the door of the door, Soleton, spinning, and ejected around, and continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the effect point of view, this should have been a fifth paragraph of magic, but the power used by him is probably less than four paragraphs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am too particular about the method and have forgotten the original goal. Magic relies not on the spells and gestures recorded in the magic book, but on beliefs and knowledge. Faith is power, and magic net is the method. It is the sum of the methods. As long as I know what I want, I can find the way I realized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flame burned through the ruins, burned the fortifications, and burned the bodies on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was blown out of the flame on the fingertips, turned over the horse, clenched the horse, and leaned over the horse's ear to whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you are her mount, I assume that you understand. Now she needs us, do you understand?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse grows up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was raised and shouted, "Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magic net is the sum of all people's cognition, and my magic is the world I know. The so-called magic is not to surrender unconditionally to other people's ideas, nor to stubbornly stick to their own ideas."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door stretched out to the left hand and caught all the blue lines that were volleyed in the hand. This time the blue lines did not escape from his fingers, but merged with his fingertips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is to understand and recognize the thoughts of others, but at the same time to retain their own ideas. We are equal. The magic net accommodates all ideas, it is completely fictional I only admit the facts. Although it is late, I finally understand these words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more blue lines in his hands, The entire network trembles at the same time. If someone uses the magic of the probe and looks straight from above, he and his horse are like a fast sailing boat, which has left a long trail in the entire magic net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand reality, just to change it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic expand, give him The magical items on the body replenished the energy, and the purple light of the superb chapter lights up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anni's porcelain shield is flying around him and his horse, dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, with three handshakes, we can change the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blu-ray Extremely dazzling. The young captain reached out and grabbed the afterglow of the sea of ​​stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have never really wanted to be a citizen, a staff officer, a city councilor or a store owner who will be a magician, and I don’t want to grow up. I’m deceiving myself, just because that goal sounds the most reasonable and simple.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negemon? Soledon took a deep breath and walked along The "Sefir Corridor" rushed into the enemy line. The enemy is trying to refill this line of defense, but the door will not give them this opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But that's just escaping. It's just what other people want, I don't want it. And what I want is..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical group that is spreading is condensing again, shining like before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power like her!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his hands, the silver-like Venus The group became a reddish meteor shower.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give me the rest of your power, 'The Sea of ​​Stars'! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of the entire Lenny Temporary Magic Net can be used for him. This is the first time he has mastered such ample magic, which is hard to describe. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still...and one more! The South Army also has an officer who can use magic! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard someone shouting like this. The door smiled and threw an accurate magic arrow.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white arrow of the magic arrow was inserted from the knight's helmet gap, and blood was spattered from it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save, accurate Precision, deadly. Resistence? Solitaire's fighting style is not a grand ornate symphony, nor an irresistible storm. It is a small citizen, a staff officer, a person who always fails, fails, fails again. The tactics that are tempered are the styles that are crystallized by repeated practice, failure, and reflection.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His enemies will be awesome in this tactical style "Meat grinder" - of course, that's what happened later.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reorganize the formation! Stop him! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door lifts his hands and points side by side. The red meteor shower is precisely on a line, enough to destroy all the resistance on this line. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let it open," he said.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanimen glanced at the ceramic armor that flew around him, probably about a third of the initial number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's OK." Nanimen said to himself, and to his horse, "resistfire! (haste)!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic is abundant and cannot be suppressed. This is not his magic, but now he is the user of these magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He crossed the burning enemy line and charged in the direction of dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone trying to reorganize the emperor? His magic bombarded the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horseshoe broke through the flames, and the stray bullets shattered the tiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone trying to reorganize the magical forces? His magic bombarded the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind of the ear is covered by noisy noise and cannot be distinguished. But he and his horse know that the speed of advancement is getting faster and faster, getting faster and faster, and the positive resistance is getting less and less and less and less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the enemy’s squad sounding around, and he saw the enemy’s flag on one side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse jumped past the last ruins, rushed into the huge explosion crater, rushed down the slope, and ran up the slope. At the end of the slope, it is the East Gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is closed? Soledon Lema stops, his right hand is pointing to the sky, looking around -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He thought that there should be several high-ranking mages at the end of the enemy array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one around. No one has attacked him, and the great magicians who once made him admire have stopped acting, perhaps fleeing the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole army’s reserve team’s military ethics, morale, will to fight, everything, all have been paralyzed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment when the Free Army may have a second powerful magician, the elite of the Empire made the most sensible decision. The court mages and pastors shivered in the depths of the fortifications, and the soldiers threw their weapons and fled, and the empire’s proud aristocrats or corpses were everywhere, or they did not know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander’s army trembled and recalled the broken soldiers scattered throughout the city. They didn’t even dare to take the East Four Gates and went to the streets in the north. Run in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is behind the city gate, through the city gate corridor, looking to the other end of the East Five District. The sun has almost risen completely. Through the sun, he can vaguely see that several Imperial knights are standing there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door smiled and raised his arm. As soon as they reached out, the knights screamed and turned and fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial aristocrats who thought they were human beings and should bear the supreme responsibility, so they left their commanders, comrades-in-arms and battlefields and fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...do it. We really did."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is not used The last star of the sea to chase them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a hook on his right hand; more than twenty red stars screamed down and knocked out all the ceramic armor pieces that he was flying around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the door is raised. He used all his strength and shouted loudly to the top:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lieutenant Sefer, we won! The emperor has collapsed! We won We both won them all! Lift the static field barrier!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a dead wall on the wall. No one answered him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Sefer?! Annie? Hey, Anne?! Don’t answer, I remember the sound and situation outside the static field. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie! If you are inconvenient to move, answer it, I will pick you up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still no response. He rolled over and dismounted, and was almost knocked down by the horse when he dismounted. The wise horse snorted and seemed to be disdainful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie! I, I have to go up really! If you can hear, answer me! I will forcefully lift your static field. Now I can do it, I said it really!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen felt that his legs had never been so heavy, and he couldn’t step away. What happened in the end? The above result is different from what he speculated? Even if he went up, could he only see her seriously stunned, even...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ran up and went straight to the nearest stairway . Throughout the battlefield, he could only hear the footsteps of his running. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resist the door, don't make trouble! You have to give the girl time to make up the makeup!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The sound came from directly above his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is raised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the imaginary tragic scene that greets him, but the dazzling beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny Seifer really has only one right hand left, but she doesn't look vulnerable at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue crystal glass magic crystals make up Anne's left arm, her legs, the rising sun shines through those crystals. Her armed belt was full of hangs, with the handle on the left side of the "kindness", and the right waist was adorned with the "power" symbolizing the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one word can describe her now-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really prestige."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is involuntarily sighed, admiring this force to turn the madness figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he knows what the god is thinking, he probably won’t laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s been so long, I’m expecting this incomprehensible guy to send a wake-up kiss. I’m an idiot... I’m just taking over the Magic Net. It’s so handsome and fashionable.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne frowned and planned to work hard again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"", "I am going to go down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She went to the edge of the wall, standing Set, wait for the answer below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was stunned and reacted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and spread his arms and responded: "Jump down, Anne, I will catch you!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne smiled and whispered to herself: "The plan is awkward. Isn’t it so complete?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;She leans forward slowly and jumps from the top of the wall in a beautiful posture--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; straight into the arms of Naimen . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young captain was busy catching her, because the impulse could not help but go back two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie’s only remaining arm clung to his neck, his body scented straight into his nostrils, making him flushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain of Naimen is blank. Whether it is the soft touch from the chest or the soft breath that the ear feels, it is so tense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just stayed with Anne back to the side of the mount and cautiously climbed onto the horse. That horse probably felt something, and once again slammed it, it seemed more disdainful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this voice, the two laughed at the same time, their eyes were opposite, and they were nervously removed at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
