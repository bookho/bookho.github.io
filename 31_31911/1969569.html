			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People say that God has created this world, and it has not been confirmed for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be confirmed that they have civilization after a long time since the emergence of intelligent creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civilization is a grand river. In the Old World, it originated from the rich plains on either side of the Ridge Mountains. Houses, villages, towns, cities, people live, gather, communicate, die. No one knows the joys and sorrows of people living in the early ages, because there is no record there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civilization is the beginning of a record to be able to confirm its existence. Civilizations without records will not have their own imprints. From those broken records, we know the existence of those civilizations. But that is not history, and the recorder is not a historian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The so-called history is to record the past rigorously and pass it on to future generations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The first truly great historian, Hiloto, defined history in his "History of Empires." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Elf nobleman, Hiloto, when the elf empire was most prosperous, used his rigorous and gorgeous words to record the establishment, growth and brilliant. The year in which the Elf Empire unified the civilized world was designated as the standard epoch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark city-state melee era is over, and the "peace of peace" is coming. People finally escaped the shadow of death and bathed in the sunshine of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first vocabulary is security, security is power. In order to ensure their own safety, people have built houses, villages, towns, cities and towns, until the brilliant civilized empire. Going back, it's all for your own safety. In the pursuit of security, the initial power was established. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you?" Maggie, Villi velli, with temptation on the face, asking the unfathomable opponent in front of him. The green-haired girl, who looks very beautiful and looks so big and brainless, and looks like a striking vase, is called Nikolay in the records of later historians; Machiavelli. No matter which history book, as long as it talks about magic history, political history or philosophy history, it will be marked with a black title on the eye-catching page number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am just a historian...a historian who studies the history of later generations and serves as the savior."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how you look at it, the blonde girl who is not part of the "true great historian" smiles and makes a self-introduction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, history in history books is separated from real history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People say that God has created this world, and it has not been confirmed for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be confirmed that they have faith after a long time since the emergence of intelligent creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did faith come about? That comes from the innate awe of our ancestors to nature. What we can confirm is that the ancestors do not worship the same gods as us. People face death, face the unmeasurable nature, face the mysterious magic and monsters that are filled in the world, and produce a firm belief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many different beliefs, many and many. Most people will say that they believe in a certain religion, and some people say that they believe in ideals, believe in love, trust money, or believe in something else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We found the grace of God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This simple statement is the first A quotation of an anonymous priest who discovered healing magic. He was traced back to "the first prophet." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the discovery and spread of healing magic, the Elf Church gradually developed, grew, and eventually united all the elves. For the first time, humans have discovered that injuries and diseases can be cured by their own strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Church unifies the faith of the entire Elven world and opens the way to the East. Under the sacred light of healing magic, the elves finally unify the city-states of all human beings in the East and establish a sinister civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radiance of the resurrection magic dissipated, Leonard; Kikawi opened his eyes. The sun in front of you is a little dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this heaven?" asked the half-elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, here is the world." Bonnie smiled and answered his doubts. "You are not dead, I have remedy that mistake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard recognized the person in front of him: "You are...?! Why?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie blinked and replied: "To help the Savior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elves Empire The prosperity of the company lasted for three hundred and nine years, and then it fell apart. What makes the war inevitable is the rise of the human civilization in the eastern provinces and the fears that arise in the provinces of the western elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to classify humans according to their positions, no matter how they are divided, they can be divided into three categories. Approved, neutral, and opposed. The so-called history is the record. People have a variety of attitudes toward changing disciplines."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second true great historian Seddy; Warrens in his "Dandelion War History" It determines the goal of historical narrative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Arthur; Coman’s Royal Record Officer, Sadie; Warrens, witnessed the elves’ empire, recession, corruption, and demise, also witnessed The rise of a new human dynasty on the ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The failure of the elf empire is not because its force is not large enough, or that the civilization it creates is not brilliant enough. It collapsed because it ignored the existence of the wider human population. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the Holy Coman Empire was established, and it promised to free humanity from the identity of second-class citizens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third vocabulary is equality, and equality is the will. Citizenship is an indestructible will. The rabble of slaves cannot defeat the courageous teachers of citizens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I lost?" Maggie; Verry asked herself. She is not willing to end up with this result, she is now only one step away from the goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time ago, Maggie had abandoned all moral restrictions on the means. She believes her plan is perfect: she calculates all possible reinforcements and arranges her own substitutes to lead them; she has at least three layers of insurance, no matter which layer is successful, she can guarantee that the Lord can not set foot on the Principality. One step in the country. She has a pirate fleet, she has multiple shelling traps, she has a strong deputy, she and herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the end she still couldn’t achieve her goal, because the lovely blonde girl in front of her is really unfathomable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggie has used enchanting magic, hinting magic, commanding magic, and even secret research to control the magic, but can not shake the girl and her protection Crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you tell me who is arranging you to be the last line of defense here?" Maggie's voice was full of helplessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie spread his hands and thought: "If I say that it is a fateful arrangement, do you believe it?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not believe." Maggie's answer is simple and clear. "I would rather believe that you have arranged all of this. In my calculations, there is no room for fate."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you can try to believe it, it’s really fate to arrange me here." Annie smiled. "I can tell you, you really should have succeeded."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggie sorrow: "How is it not important? Your presence has shaken my confidence. We are all the same, but you are better than me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne slammed back and looked like it was hit hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am with Nikola; Machiavelli is the same kind? This joke is really not funny... If it is Bonnie, this comment is almost the same." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My sister," Annie replied. "The appearance is very cute. It is actually a very unlovable girl. Others have called her 'reconstruction of the female Machiavelli'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Well... so to speak, is that behind you?" Maggie suddenly pointed to the corridor behind Anne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne; Seifer turned back and saw Bonnie standing behind her with a quiet smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...when did you come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, probably you Say 'it's really not cute'." The girl who had just used the resurrection of the times seemed to smile very indifferently. This smile made Annie feel a bit cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Church blazed as the empire burned, and then began to split as the Empire reached its peak of peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some pastors said that there is only one true God, and all the remaining wizards, wizards, and religions should be banned and classified as heresy. Some pastors also objected that those religions also follow the will of the church, and their god is the manifestation of the highest god. The only god faction only honors the elves' own sun gods, while the alliance factions accept the human beliefs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If God loves the world, he will not stop us from continuing on the road to exploring nature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The chief elder of the covenant faction said that it was at the first memorial of the Taranto Conference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, the Elf Church has officially split, splitting into a sun god that suppresses arcaneism and a covenant that encourages arcaneism. The split of the doctrine actually splits the human beings and the elves; after that, the church is divided into Western churches and Eastern churches, and the once brilliant elf empire is gradually cracking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eastern Covenant Church was subjected to two centuries of oppression and persecution, but this did not prevent them from creating outstanding theology. Due to the fusion of Arcane magic techniques, the Covenant Church's magical development is faster than the Sun God Church. Finally, after the devastating dandelion war, the Covenant Church became orthodox, and the only church retreated to the Western Forest. Since then, human magicians and pastors have finally stepped onto the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth vocabulary is tolerance, and tolerance is assimilation. Tolerance and intolerance are the gap between winners and losers. Persecution can only be effective for a while, but tolerance can last for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is returned to the deck of the "Dano" on the previous minute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only inner priest in the world who can use resurrection to complete the magic, stretched out and dispelled the exhaustion of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, do you know that I am not a spy?" Bonnie said loudly in the direction of the "Kleon Emperor", looking at the back of the mast . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza and Ionet looked at each other and walked out of the hiding place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bonnie! Leonard! What are you doing? What are the pirates and seamen who can’t move?" As usual, Reza The problem is as fast as a cannon, and others have no gaps in the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Leonard; Kikawi’s head is big, and all four fingers in his left hand are knocked. What happened just now? "Oh, I can only tell you that the pirates were conquered by me, then I was killed by Anne, and I was resurrected by Bonnie..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What is this mess?" Reza yelled, "Bonnie, let me explain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In a nutshell, this is an enemy plot, then I cracked the enemy's plot. The pirates were conquered by Mr. Kakawi, which was an unexpected gain." Bonnie explained in a calm tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And why are you a mage and pastor, Bonnie?" Reza asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown-haired girl thought for a moment and said, "I admit, I did deceive you in my ability... but I hope that you can still trust me as before." I don't have any hostility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes are deep and bottomless, but they are bright and undoubted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, we are already our own. Deceive me, not just you, I am next to this. I believe in you, chase the enemy. Let's go." Reza finally made a decision. Her tone is dull, but she is full of firmness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you trust so much, I will go all out." Bonnie smiled and took a big step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute!" Chief Bishop Ionet finally caught the opportunity to intervene. "How do you use resurrection with inner magic?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I am standing on the shoulders of future generations." The puzzling answer came with the southwestern trade wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette has a chance, but has no chance to continue to ask. He turned and found that Reza had already helped Leonard and was introducing her identity to the half-elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Ionet; Hartmann, the chief bishop of the New World Parish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Ah? The original Nopp, you are... I am worried, Bonnie has forgotten to remove the magic of these brothers! I am relieved that there is a bishop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The chief bishop, a busy turn, began to count the number of people who set the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10,20...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io feels that there is a slight sweat on his forehead Out. How much power does it take to lift so many magical spells...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this chaotic dark world, we are the last barrier of civilization. Believe in yours Faith, adhere to the day of the return of light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first dynasty of Koman collapsed, and the two hundred years of war began. The Orthodox Church and the Magic Arbitration Association were persecuted and killed by mobs and local tyrants. The feudal lords who thought they were superior were killed by a handful of scholars and mages only to ensure their own safety. The Church and Arbitration Association silently endured the greatest evil and chaos of humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are all future generation historians, because we are in the afterlife and remember what has happened. We are not future generation historians because of historians Not a prophet, they will not predict the history of 'the future generations.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third true great historian Crohn; Salami is in him The limitations of historians are stipulated in the "Korman dynasty". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living in the chaotic era of the collapse of the first dynasty of Koman, Crohn; Sarami’s account of the division of feudal aristocrats, people’s ambitions, in troubled times The limit of human ugliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the end of the manuscript, he pointed out from a historical perspective that this confusion will not last forever. Whether it is separatist or reunification, a new era of peace will surely come again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is expected. The second dynasty of Keman swept the stale feudal serf system and established a new central government with lightning speed. After limiting the power of the aristocracy and removing the fixed system of serfs, the air of the empire was new. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth vocabulary is freedom, and freedom is prosperity. Freedom can bring powerful economic power and technical strength. How much freedom is limited, how much prosperity is limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie just found her sister and Maggie, and she heard the words of her sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie wiped the cold sweat on her head: "In fact, I don't mean that. People just want to retort..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, she looks like a student who was caught by the teacher in class. People who are often awkward are using "people" as their own reference, which sounds quite chilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't care about this little thing. However, your sister and you are very happy to talk to the enemy." Bonnie said with a quiet smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... It’s not good to fight and kill. We are all women. We don’t need to fight first to create friendship. You say yes, Bonnie?" The sister panicked and became incoherent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!" Annie turned her head, but saw Maggie still standing in front of her with a smile. She said with amazement: "No, it's still here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie smiled, reached out and touched the body of Maggie —— Her fingers actually penetrated the past from the green hair beauty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magic of the gentleman’s shifting illusion is really skilled, and it’s great to be able to change a big living person into a phantom in front of us. It’s amazing. Presumably you Is the male Machiavelli?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown-haired girl's fingers point to the other end of the corridor. Her words are very polite and the tone is very pleasing, but it shocks men and women who have escaped from a short distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time we are all finished, Nikolay... How can there be such a powerful sister?" Maggie whispered to the man next to him. Exclaimed, the pace at the foot was not slow, and the three steps rushed up the stairs in two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not in the same place, Ionite and the mysterious alchemist blocked it, and almost died." Named Nikola The man’s face is full of bitterness. “Fortunately, I have been in stealth state before I have a chance to rescue you. I didn’t expect it to be discovered...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't say so much, it's important to escape! Is that something coming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The two rushed to the deck of the "Kleon Emperor" and gave a cheer; Anne and Bonnie followed behind them, but was taken aback. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is actually a two-legged flying dragon descending from the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reborn church has mastered the power of the spirit and slowly slipped into the **. The orthodox church has gradually become a land of filth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can such a singer also speak of God's grace? God is in the hearts of each of us."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the banner of the Reformation fluttered in Lennie, and the Southern Revolution broke out; that was after the 1500 years of the unified civilized world of the Elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new church, which has no carvings or gorgeous decorations, has lost its secular shackles, but has won the favor of believers. Under the tide of reform, the orthodox church and the only church finally began the slow pace of improvement. Stubbornness will surely turn **, and the new era of trade winds will soon blow up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth vocabulary is rationality, and rationality is progress. In this world, the spirit can be turned into strength, and that is the iron's natural law. Generations of people have worked hard to explore the mysteries of the material world and the spiritual world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can there be a dragon?" The chief bishop raised his head. "Is it still too conservative?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge Wyvern is docked at the top of the mast, and the claws grab the cross of the top of the sail and make a low hum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggie arm raised his arm and ordered the magic exit; the behemoth I swooped down in obedience and stopped in front of them. Maggie and Nikolay immediately turned agilely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...why is that beauty going there?" Leonard, who had just woke up for a long time, stared at the rider on the dragon in amazement. "It won't be Was it fascinating to Machiavelli?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Charming monster? Was this magic done so early?" Bonnie catching up on the deck surprised himself. Self-speaking, this seems to have some deviation from her knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get off! 正东方! Nikolay, hold me tight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disregard the deck All over the enemy, Maggie gave the two-legged dragon a strict order. She picked up the reins and the dragon immediately vacated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the other priest who wants to escape, with long white hair, raises his hand unhurriedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red-yellow light, like the summer sun, slowly gathered between his hands. The Burning Line is a "humane" long-range killing magic that priests often use to burn evil creatures and undead creatures. It works well in the hands of the chief bishop's priest, and is more than any ordinary attacking magic. contend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"meta extend (super extended shooting)..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gathered in the hands of Io The yellow light is getting brighter and brighter. Focusing on more divine power or magical power, you can use super-magic skills - whether you can use super-magic skills properly is a watershed between high-level wizards and low-level wizards. Super-expansion is one of the basic super-magic techniques used to increase the range of ray-like magic; as long as the basic magic is strong enough, it can be increased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...launch!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yellow light in his hand slammed into a The hot ball is turned into a direct beam to the dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Maggie's legs clamped the dragon saddle, and both hands jerked the reins! The dragon immediately looked up and flashed the yang radiation, only a small scratch on the wing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing this scene, Ionite screams in his heart. After using thirty-five dispels of magic, even if he felt a little bit of strength, he couldn't hit another same burning line at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leisha can only be anxious in the side - in the blink of an eye, the dragon has already surpassed the range of all her effective means of attack. The magician of the alchemist, the middle and the short-range war can be proud of himself; but there is really no reason to be proud of the long-range war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurry up this time, Maggie ya once again urged the speed of the dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you run a kilometer, it's safe!" She knew that it was almost the limit of all attacking magic. "Never stay here!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne; Sefer looked at the back of the dragon and smiled coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know, Miss Maggie? Actually, this action you should have succeeded. Your only mistake is to use me." The girl raised her left thumb and closed one eye, aiming at the two people on the flying dragon one kilometer away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"syang gun"......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, as if the sun is in her hands The incandescent light is obscured, and everything in the heavens and the earth seems to have become dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"meded (self-guided extended range shooting)..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This super demon name pair People in the seventeenth century were extremely strange: they had never heard of such super magic skills. Completely ignoring any range limitation, the ultra-magic skill of the target must be “self-guided”, which was completed in the mid-nineteenth century. If the sister is best at countering other people's magic, my sister is best at enhancing his magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...launch!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dazzling incandescent light begins to condense and become a small ball , I am about to shoot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be a beam of light that symbolizes the proud achievements of modern magical civilizations of the two centuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no 'history without a position' in this world. As long as there is a history of positions, it cannot be said to be absolutely true. 'Historical truth' and ' There is always a gap between the realities. The existence of history has no meaning in itself; history is a collection of historical events and future generations. Please treat all viewpoints fairly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; I don’t know how many true great historians Ionette; Hartman said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a long, long time later, and now he is studying how to lift this magic against the mysterious "elastic enchantment". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette; Hartman still has a lot of darkness in the age of history, but the arrival of light is unstoppable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop, my sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne is about to shoot the powerful sun rays in her hand, Bonnie is in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, what are you doing!" Anne was surprised and hurriedly turned the direction of the Yangyan ray in her hand. The incandescent light shines like a god, flying vertically into the sky and penetrating the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back to see the ray of Maggie, his face became pale. She finally understood today, how far is it from the extremes of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nikolay, after you go back, do you start to learn spiritual control magic?" The green-haired beauty uses a spoiled tone, but the content is very serious. "I want to start retreating to do magic research, and the next task will trouble you to execute independently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, really, noble lady?" Fraud As soon as the mage was excited, he hugged the body of the woman in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you touch your hand again, I will throw you away. Don't forget, I can always find someone who replaces you with 'Machiavelli'... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nikola face a red, hurriedly let go of his hand, almost really fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be blinded by your anger. We have interfered with history and can't continue to expand the scope of interference." Bonnie's tone is exceptionally calm. "Are you really ready to kill? You will regret it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Anne’s anger has not completely dissipated. "I was almost poisoned by the poisonous woman." You have to kill innocents!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you kill them, you are killing another person." Bonnie's tone is full of confidence. She knew that there was a way to persuade her sister in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you erased Machiavelli from history, The man who will be the Prime Minister of the Holy Empire in the future, is resistant to the door; Hugh; Keman, is already dead - no, it should be said that this person will never exist." Bonnie smiled. "You can accept this result." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne seems to have been poured a cold water by her head: "But this is not to say, what history can we not change?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's like this." Bonnie snorted. "So I said, you have to make that weird wish, you will definitely regret it. The result actually went to two." More than a hundred years ago..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't help it! Who knows that wishes will become like this... But, anyway, you and I become young Isn't this wish all realized? Don't lose it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's also true." Bonnie laughed. "However, about the body. Question... Before making a wish, are you also looking at the "glaring" sent by the airship?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Don't you look at the fashion magazine? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister smiled and nodded: "Ah, the cover girl is pretty good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The two are relatively speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, Bonnie! Haven't we changed history?" Suddenly, Annie remembered a key question, "Lord, he didn't, No death! How can this history continue to be written down?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown-haired girl has no choice but to spread her hand: "I have thought of this for a long time, but There is no good way. Can't we both kill him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you kidding!" The blonde girl immediately vetoed the proposal. Now we should... What to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice came from the side coldly: "Now both of you should give me this hostess to explain the current situation. Who are you in the end?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The pure gold alchemist" cold-faced, with his hands on his hips, staring at the two. Beside her, Ionette and Leonard, who had the same expression, surrounded the two sisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
