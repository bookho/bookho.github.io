			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She walked up the dark stairs. The wooden structure of the second floor of the hotel is small and oppressive, all the doors look like a look, no number and no room name. The wooden floor creaked as if it would go down at any time. She stopped at the end of several rooms, made a decision, paused for two moments, paused for a while, and tapped twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is automatically opened silently, and it is very quiet. Quiet to the ticking of even the pocket watch can be heard. There were a total of nine candle lights in it, and in the darkness a man sat by the bed away from her. She walked in and sat down on another bed, and the bed made a slight noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me what happened to Kengal after Govar’s death. Concise, summary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The man turned around. "They huddled together and decided to disarm the Lenny Army to surrender and save their lives. It was Nikola's - no, should you say that you did it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp She couldn’t hear it, stood up violently, and the magic gathered in her right hand. However, somehow, the spells are like a sinking sea. She tried in vain for spiritual temptation, energy attack, or illusion of illusion, but no magic can be used. Not an anti-magic array, but like a powerful interference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been pursuing you for a long time. You always hide in various ways, affecting everything in the back. But this time your position is too high. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no ups and downs in the tone of the man, and every syllable is squeezed out of the teeth." The candles are extinguished one by one, and only the sound of the pocket watch is clearly audible. She suddenly realized that the person in front of me would say two syllables per second, not many, many. She wanted to ask questions, but found that she was not even able to ask questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to ask who I am, and I don't have to ask how I found it here. I won't make a deal because it is no longer necessary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last two candles are left...No, it’s one. Another light source comes from the person's hand: it is a swaying candle that reflects off the metal surface. She finally understood that the pupil was magnified uncontrolled. This kind of emotion... is it called fear and despair? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good night. I wish a good dream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man continues to use his rhythmic The voice said. She only feels a cold on her chest...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie; Saphir gasped and slammed up and found himself awakened by nightmares as usual. I don't know when the quilt covers only her legs, and the upper body is exposed to the cold air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she was too used to it, it took only three seconds for her to regain her calmness and determine her current state and location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is less than eleven o'clock in the evening, she still has at least six hours to fall asleep again, which makes her feel a little joy. There was a slight flash of fire in the fireplace around him, which dispelled the coldness of the room. The fireplace reminded her that she was in the capital of the Syrian Republic of Kegler, the coldest capital in the southern republics. In this city, magic alone cannot guarantee that you will not be frozen at night. As a starting point for her political career, the city is full of crises, but it is also full of opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tonight is a thriller, the change is really much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the nightmare Different late in the evening, covering all movie types from youth movies to action movies, the only thing in common is that there is a terrible ending. No matter what kind of magic or potion is used, or changing your sleep habits, you can't change these dreams. The underlying causes of these nightmares are basically clear to herself. If the content of the dream is analyzed by psychoanalysis, she can get the title of "founder of psychoanalysis." After all, this era has not analyzed psychotherapists who receive £250 each time. Here is the world she was born two centuries ago, and all modern science is still in its infancy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her own time, Bonnie; Sefer is the elite of the Magic Arbitration Association, capable of using both arcane and magic, both rational and emotional Genius. In this era, she is a manipulator behind the scenes, with a variety of identities, from dangerous half-vampires, efficient managers to respected officials, to handle any situation. In the eyes of ordinary people, she should be completely free of any troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the dream tonight seems a bit strange: the symbolicity is not so strong, and the plot is also a little bit reasonable in the abruptness. Perhaps because of her uneasiness about the future? Radz; Govar died too early, which seriously disrupted her plan: she had to work with Nikola; Machiavelli to fight for the peaceful return of Kengal to the Free Army. This dream may be that she would rather see this person alive in her subconscious as a shield against Delan and Lenny. This idea seems to be too escaping...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knock on the door interrupted her thoughts. The voice of the maid came from outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Luther, sorry to disturb your sleep, but the second secretary of state is waiting for you in the living room."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, wait a moment..." Bonnie habitually spoke, only to find that the voice was a female voice. The girl hurriedly added illusion to her, changed her voice, flattened her chest, and got dressed. After realizing the predicament of being a woman, she chose a different approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened the door and walked into the reception room. The one who is waiting for her there is the most powerful person in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good night, Luther Financial Assistant. I am sorry to visit this late night." The black-dressed, serious-looking visitor stood up and greeted her. Road. The clock in the corner shows that it is 11 o'clock in the evening, and it is really midnight for the cold winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good night, Nikolay. Is it a very urgent matter to come in this late night? Is it related to the upcoming Central Army? Said that the already defensive garrison intends to violate the disarming order?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She got up and asked with a male voice. This is her chosen identity, a playboy with a neutral beauty, the new Filipino assistant to the Secretary of the Republic of the Republic of Bruto; Luther. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political system of the Republic of the Union is centered on the parliament, the government-judicial-military department is the executive body system, the parliament generates the government, appoints officers, and approves the judiciary. The parliament with the highest power is composed of the city council, the parliament of the Republic, and the parliament, which can produce a number of executive committees in an emergency. The highest power chiefs of the republics are state secretaries, ranging from one to three in elections. They share all powers and perform daily government affairs - two in the Republic of Turk. The number of professionals who assist them is called the “auxiliary officer”, and the number is equally uncertain. Among them, the financial assistant is the most important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is considerable influence, but it does not cause the identity of those who are really dangerous. After all, in front of her there is the more conspicuous existence of "Nikolay; Machiavelli". Not long ago, she persuaded the man to work with her to solve the difficult problem faced by the Kengal government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no. To be honest, I am coming tonight to discuss with you, if we want to escape now. All my staff are like this. Suggestion, but I still want to hear your opinion. After all, you are the one that even 'her' can trust."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie’s movements froze . The man in front of him has completely lost the inscrutable and politician style of the weekdays, leaving only panic. Even with the addition of the three-tiered aides, he couldn't handle this complicated situation; after all, he was just the real "Machiavelli" used to deceive the world. "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Radetz; Govar returned. He controlled the army before I could react." Nikolay from Inside the coat, an invitation and a report were issued. "And this is his invitation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is this possible?!" Hear this The news, Bonnie's hippie smiles disappeared on weekdays. "His death should be an unquestionable fact! This was investigated by a special investigation team. They used a variety of magic to restore the scene!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You say That's right. Both you and my intelligence network, or the spokesperson of the Lenny government, have vowed to say that he should be a dead man," Nikolay said irritably. "But the problem is that this person is not only coming back." And the situation was also controlled. The first secretary, Chase, must take the opportunity to cancel the disarming order and pursue the responsibility of my previous surrender. The guy with a false name has long been ignoring me and will not miss this opportunity."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way... Chase; Brighton, this little character is also happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;After receiving the 10th Division stationed in Fort Vatican, the commander-in-chief, Commander-in-Chief Govar, and negotiator Chase; Brighton’s unclear news, Kengler was completely in a state of horror. The caretaker government passed the decision to disarm the North Army to the north without much effort and was prepared to accept the fact of failure. But at this juncture, the old marshal, who has been regarded as a dead by all parties, returned with his remnants who died in the dead, and the means of excitement are better than ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie believes that Govar should indeed die. It is not because of the "amateur" on-site rehabilitation of the special investigation team, but because this thing was personally confirmed by her sister. It's hard to imagine anything wrong with what my sister, Anne's Master, has confirmed. There are no more than one hand in the world who can beat Annie in magic, and there is definitely no one who can compare with her in magical diversity. After all, that is the brainchild of all two hundred years of modern magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time Govar’s efficiency is indeed abnormally high, if we don’t act quickly...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "So, if you consider going to the appointment?" Bonnie looked up and re-suspended the casual smile. "Although I don't know if there are any beautiful people, I don't mind going to this late-night banquet." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Going to the appointment? This is too risky. In fact, my apartment has been monitored. I don't think that the popular Zeiss is a popular one. The person who will be merciful. Besides, 'her' is not there, we don't have the last insurance method..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter." Bonnie smiled contemptuously. It seems to imply something: "If there is any danger, as long as the other person has a woman, I can get it. Is there a limited time for the invitation? Or is it as soon as possible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Nikolay looked at the "he" who was overconfident and seemed to understand. He opened the invitation: "They said to discuss as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As soon as possible. Then we better start now, give a surprise to these servants. Bonnie called the maid to ring and let her bring a formal dress for formal occasions only. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now?" Nikola asked. "Would you be too anxious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now. The other side will not sleep tonight, but is busy sorting out the situation." Bonnie put on a windbreaker coat. "It must be very difficult to get here in such a cold day. This is probably the best." The opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, the second Secretary of State Nikola; Machiavelli and the financial assistant Bruto; Luther set off. When sitting in the carriage, Bonnie couldn't help but think of the bloody rain seen in the previous dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is her known history, the city should now face the siege of the emperor. After the Emperor's lightning-fast capture of Steelburg, the entire northern war was supposed to collapse without help... She tried to change, but did not know how much it could change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the heavily guarded country hotel door, passing by the nervous newbie guard; when Bonnie; Sefer finally saw the person who was supposed to die It is midnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She only used one glance to find out that this person is a living person. It is not a zombie that is resurrected with a spell, nor is it a sinister illusionist's self-righteous work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I obviously heard that he is dead. No, he must have died. This must be magic, but..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray-haired supervised government marshal looks very tired, much older than the Govar in her memory. Those wrinkles and white hair are so real, and every hair can't see the problem. If you have to say that it is an illusion, it is also a fascinating illusion. To maintain this level of illusion, not only does it require amazing magic or powerful magical items, but it also requires a sufficient amount of information to simulate the subject himself, as well as a professional mage who has great experience in obtaining information. Even in a future where almost everyone can use magic, this condition is difficult to get together, not to mention the fact that the number of casters is still less than one percent of the total population...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... unless the other party has premeditated. And there is only one family that can have such premeditated forces; at least, the politician who is arguing over there will definitely not succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect you to come over, Nikola. You sell the country faster than anyone else. We built it with great hardships, Free, autonomous Rusher, will you be thrown back to Rennie's locusts in a blink of an eye?! Fortunately, we are back, otherwise the Central Army will enter Kengal three days later!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You! Are you a politician in a democratic country like this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for Chase to finish, coming from the other side of the room A gentle applause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s refreshing. It’s true that Machiavelli is well-deserved. If you are born in our country, you can be a good cabinet minister, no, maybe the prime minister. Born in this country, it is a waste of your talent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonnie turned his attention to the man. It was a young aristocrat who was dressed in a neat but not neat armor, sitting on the sofa and posing with a big sword in his hands. In this person, she saw the temperament that citizens of the free country did not have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it a bit of a headache on the way here?" she asked with a scornful attitude. "For the Sir Alex of the Empire, the wet soil of the South But it's not very good. Is it a woman who doesn't like it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where. Although I am not very interested in women in the South, my other one Companions seem to be hunting a lot here. These civilians also have a longing for the noble title." The knight did not look at her when she spoke. "I will see you, this gentleman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Financial Auxiliary Officer, Pluto; Luther."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, the financial assistant should not be... ..." Hearing Bonnie's self-introduction, Chase stood up in amazement. "...Is it done, Nikola?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just that your former assistant is found to have corrupt behavior. It’s a very common thing. His cell is in the Otis prison, you can take the time to visit. Now, we don’t have to treasure Time wasted in political life has ended humans. "Machiavelli still maintain a high-pressure attitude, nothing like the representatives of the initiative came to the door of the negotiations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first secretary of the State Secretary’s face became iron blue, his fists clenched, his teeth biting and squeaking: “Talking about the future of the country with you, fundamentally It’s playing the symphony against the goblin...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A low voice suddenly broke in and interrupted them. "Enough. If you are not sincere, the talks will end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this vocal statement, Bonnie’s mouth tilted slightly . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This person who plays Marshal Govar seems to have a considerable degree of acting. It seems that it will not be easy to wear tonight-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, she also understands that there is no point in exposing the other side here. The other party has already made a desperate attempt to this point, and will not hesitate to take more risks to kill Luther and Machiavelli. Even if you really want to expose it, you have to stay at a critical moment to reverse the situation. Holding the mentality of "listening to the purpose of the other party first," she hinted that Nikolay had taken up the stance in order to fight for equal negotiating status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once she stopped speaking, the other’s right to speak was concentrated on the nobleman who claimed to be the imperial envoy “Frasol; Rasta”. Together with Chase, he brought all the requirements out one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Three days later, Lenny's 'Central Army' will arrive in the city. To save the government, we can only seek assistance from the Empire to stop the The five national divisions and the second division continue to go north. We must let those who are trying to repress us, know that the Ruhrocks will not be as shackled as in the past week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I promised in the name of the emperor that unless Kengler falls or receives your request, we will never send troops into Ruolock. What the empire does will only guarantee the independence of the Freedom of the Ruhrlock government. And send an informal military adviser to help you defend against the aggressive attack of the Lenny. We will always be your most loyal friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In short, at the seventh Now that the division and the eighth division have surrendered, we must not continue to disarm this way! Lenny does not agree to our reopening of negotiations, we will never retreat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Having heard these impassioned submissions, Ni discerning mind. In the end, it is to think of the opportunity of the gnome Locke to be unstable, with "guarantee independence" and "military protection" as bait, directly put the emperor into the hinterland of the republics. She even more determined that the silent Govar in front of him would be a counterfeit. She changed her sitting position and signaled that Nikolay continued to refute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie added: "Exactly, it is a common embarrassment that can support a month after the eighth division surrendered. We could not support it for a month. If we want to continue to support more than 60,000 North Army, the empire should at least To provide assistance of 800,000 gold marks per month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"800,000 gold marks!" When you hear this number, think of your special work budget, Rasta almost stood up from the couch. If you agree to this number, the imperial budget deficit in 1666 will be doubled. He thought about it while holding his forehead and slowly said, "This number...somewhat difficult. How about half-fold?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then we might have to let another division Surrender to Lenny. What do you think of the surrender of the 'Republic' of Steelburg, Jazz?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for Rasta to return, Ge Marshal Valle first inserted: "The republic of the United States can't do it. The first division to join the Central Army means war. Now we can't have a single division, or the whole front will collapse."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie raised his eyebrows. This fake Govar seems to be helping them negotiate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...500,000." Rasta spit out the largest number he can authorize, "up to a 300,000 guaranteed loan in the name of the emperor." "<Lu /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Luther" held his chin and his left hand tapped the arm of the sofa: "There is a problem with the secured loan, that is, the Kengal regime must remain safe." Otherwise, the banks in the South may not provide anyone with the money, and the banks in the north... I am blunt, that is no different from the emperor’s direct payment. To protect this, the army of the imperial Kegler must be controlled in symbolicity. Within a thousand people, and promised not to provoke a conflict. Steelburg cannot be stationed in the army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. If the emperor is stationed in an army Here, there is no difference between us and the empire that we have surrendered. The people of the Ruhrlock don’t like Lonnie’s arrogance, but they don’t like the oppression of DeLand,” added Nikolay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Five thousand people. 500,000 marks, 300,000 loans." Rasta looked serious, "for a neutral, unhostile Ruhrlock. A little expensive? If..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't have to be. If you think that the gentleman over there can rule this country, let us now It doesn't matter if you kill it. The long-term investment will be much higher than the 800,000 gold mark every month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie crossed her hands on her lap and looked at Cai Si, the people in the whole room sighed at the same time. The first secretary of state clenched his fist angrily, and the detective magic light reflected on his body turned into a deep red color representing "anger" in Bonnie's right eye, but was stopped by Rasta's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gowar used his right index finger and middle finger to move his gray-white curly hair, sinking into the air: "Really, if you let a 25,000-strong army advance to Kengler, the Free Army will probably continue to expand. If one is not careful, it is the detonated gunpowder barrel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, the current situation is not gunpowder Is it a bucket? Can this situation be maintained all the time? The garrison of Steelburg must be reduced, and the number of our troops in Kengal should be adjusted according to the number of positive Lenny."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rasta’s eyes flashed a glimmer of dissatisfaction. This emotional volatility is also reflected in green as reflected in Bonnie's right eye. She used the cipher to signal Nikolay to retreat two steps, and began to speculate on the position of the other mysterious magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, three months. During this time, you protect our independence, wait until the election, how? This time is enough for you. No. The force is no more than half of the front free army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Govar and Rasta looked at each other and nodded. "Complete."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, in the next three months, we will do our best."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Machiavelli left the provocative words and turned away. Bonnie looked at the "Gowar" thoughtfully and then withdrew from the room behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other "Raditz; Govar" seems to be very interesting. Although it is a fake, he does not seem to stand firmly on the side of the imperial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
