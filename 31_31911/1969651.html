			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May+12, Sturburgh, April 13th, 1666<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two ways to capture a fortress. You can choose to storm from the outside or infiltrate from the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals who believe that they are famous will always prefer the latter, rather than hard-fought. There are many ways to infiltrate a fortress from the inside, airborne, authentic, anti-involvement, impersonation, transmission, invisibility... Those commanders who want to be in the annals of history have turned these methods back and forth, dreaming that one day they will be able to turn the strongest fortress on the ground into a strong fortress. Your own stepping stone. However, in the era of designing this fortress, the most important means of siege were precisely street fighting, magical approaching and internal penetration. The generation of fortress designers is not a mathematician, they are conspirators. What they are thinking about is not how to stop the enemy from entering the fortress, but to make the enemy who has entered the fortress unable to live alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guys are more like the guardians of the dungeons who designed the tombs of the ancient kings, Ionite thought quietly. In the history of his defense of Steele's offense and defense, the attack from the outside has only succeeded once, and the attack from the inside out has never been successful. The all-metal bullet-proof bevel exudes glare, like the prison island outside Port DeLand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette recalls the order he received, "It’s a plan of no intention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Io's monk, can we restart the defensive magic and magical devices on our body? We are no longer in the Free Magic Zone." His deputy, Leon, has a man's name but is a woman. In the sable retreat, all the people are called each other by the monks, wearing the same priests, both men and women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Master Leone. Communicate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this sentence, The Freedom Army, who led them to the front of the Fort Sill, frowned. "Wait a minute, you must disarm all the ladies, ladies. Very rude, please understand. We dare not let so many armed priests enter the fortress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We didn't have any armed forces. Treatment, guardianship and love are the best armed forces." Ionette replied with two rings on the right index finger and middle finger. He did not correct the misunderstanding of the officer. He knows that many people regard this retreat as a "woman knight", but the red dresses that have been in charge of this meeting have not corrected this misunderstanding, and he does not have this power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 苜蓿 苜蓿 掌握 master the treatment and life magic, is one of the most important cults of the Orthodox Church, its history can be traced back to the end of the Elven Empire. There are rumors that the saints who founded this rite have served as Arthur; Hugh; the former Prime Minister of the Emperor Koman, but all the early records were lost in the dark ages, leaving only the rumor: "All brothers and sisters are equal. There should be no difference." All the precepts of the sect are from this rumor, and perhaps will end in rumors. If they fail, I am afraid that there will be nothing left in the retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the fierce face looked at the monks behind him suspiciously, and eventually his vigilance against the empire failed to defeat the male stupid instinct. "You are free, Egru's deputy chief will come soon. But you must remember that although we advocate religious freedom, it does not mean that you can force others to believe in your Orthodoxy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, you don't have to worry. We are here only to reflect our goodwill." Leon said with a smile. Io did not tell her the real order. She does believe that this is a goodwill activity to ensure that the Imperial Fourth Army can successfully pass through Fort Steel in the near future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy chief of a light yellow military uniform came very soon. He took the rank of major and was tagged with two medals and clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s nice to meet you, sisters in the north. Your knack for healing magic will benefit us a lot.” Associate Dean gestures on his chest I warmly embraced Io, "Please come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionai features a nod, with his own more than a dozen subordinates to follow him Deep in Fort Steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gestures made by the Associate Dean can be broken down into three separate actions, each representing a Coyman letter. Together they are the "Royal Security Department." All the royalists who survived the guillotine and the gallows in the South were loyal to him through this department, which was the hand of the emperor to rule the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io smiled and he didn't know what would happen. The order was passed from the church, and only told him to act. "To tell the truth, I don't know it yet. I want to confirm the evacuation route."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Retreat? Scorpio, every time, it will be dead. Egru's lips twitched. "Don't want to kill from the main entrance, don't consider sending. The only transfer positioning here is under the commander's tower. I think the safest way is to take you out again, you guys." Are you ready for military uniforms or casual clothes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io nodded: "Yes, but I am not used to preparing only one set of plans. Can take us to the commander tower to see Look?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The place is a bit sensitive. A group of Intel Thunder took the central order and wanted to enter the fortress, negotiating with us, nearby guards A lot." Egru slaps his head. "Oh, yes, maybe we can go behind the tower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They bypass the staggered buildings Drill into the narrow corridor and up and down the steps. Numerous iron gates hang over the entrances and exits of stairs, corridors, overpasses, and tunnels. It may be as long as a password falls, and there are countless deadly magic. Egru told them to circumvent the seemingly correct roads and be more careful with the road signs. Ionite whispered to her deputy, Leon, to let her remember the road here. As for the trap, he is not worried - there are only a handful of magic traps that the cardinal can't break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come, Io, the monk. That is the commander..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io is about to lift At first, the sound of the glass ruptured into his eardrum, and the sound source was just above his head. He subconsciously took a step back, but still some glass slag and falling objects hit the hood and cloak and stuck to it. The cardinal wiped it off and found that the stain on the index finger was red. He bowed his head in a wrong way, and a fleshy body was lying in front of him. The monks screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods. Who is this corpse?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Egru蹲That group of flesh and blood. It is not difficult to identify the person's identity, but it is difficult to accept it - his eyes are wide and his expression is suddenly distorted. "The rank is still on the shoulder, it is the lieutenant of the Lieutenant... No. No! It's not for me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guarded soldiers will soon gather. "We all know that you are not doing it." Ionet was busy. "The murderer is the one inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly realized that he underestimated the Minister of Security. Sid's ability. Some people at the core of the fortress, in the siege of nearly 20,000 soldiers, killed the commander of the entire army in front of the officers who commanded them. No matter who does this kind of thing, they have to challenge the ancients who built the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette touched the two platinum rings on his right hand, turned them, and thought nervously. "That is what he wants us to do?" He has the confidence to cope with these dangers, but he is not confident to take the nuns to cope. They have the names of men and perhaps the power of men, but they are not cardinals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Io's monk?" The magnetic alto of Leon's monk reminded him, "What should we do?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette stared at the broken window overhead, and seemed to see a sharp look at him and his plans, reminding him of the risk of this mission. He always felt that he had felt this way, but I don't know why I can't recall it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the word called? I have known each other..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that broken window In the back room, people have not recovered from the impact of the emergency. The first one to wake up to God is the bishop from Kengal. Nimola stood up and gently pressed his holy emblem on the table, commanding everyone with a thick and majestic voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Innocent Lambs, let go of the weapons! The divine contract tells us that violence can't solve any problems, only new problems can be created."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As infected, people put their guns and sabre on the table, only those who have no weapons like Annie, Bonnie and Nikolay put. There was a glimmer of resistance in the mind of Naimen, but he still put two guns in his hand on the table. Seeing that everyone had put down their weapons, the bishop wiped the sweat from his forehead and gave the control of the situation to Bonnie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just said... the bishop? Is there a master here?" Hearing this legendary honorary faculty, the other's general commander of the army was shocked and almost on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am." Bonnie suppressed the panic in her heart and stood up, like a real religious person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are amazed. They only know Pluto; Luther is a politician and banker, and he does not know that he still has this identity. The new church advertises that all believers are equal and there is no large and complex church organization. In the teaching, there are only three official faculty members, such as priests, priests, and rulings. Only those who make great contributions to the church will be awarded the title of “executive bishop”. In a sense, this title is more respectable in the South than the Federal Parliament Speaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I regret deeply about the accident. Please calm down, we must not kill each other here." She went to the window with her fingers Stroking the broken glass, looking downstairs, finishing the thoughts. She hides the panic in her eyes and does not let anyone see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, she has not officially received this appointment, nor is she responsible for any mission of the Covenant Revision, but she can understand Nimola the goal of. By forcing the command magic, you can control ten people, but you can never control 18,000 people. She must take this burden to appease the eight thousand soldiers. The guards will come up soon, and...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie suddenly saw the team of hooded monks downstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She blinked her eyes, the hooded monks were still there, and the headed man held his head and seemed to see her too. She suddenly felt a chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are those people here? Who are they?" Her lips twitched, considering the worst possible. A lot of messy footsteps and shouts came from under the commander tower, reminding her of the time constraints. She is busy giving her sister a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne nodded and untied the command of Nyman and Nikolay. Nikolay picked up the pistol from the table and immediately took control of several senior officers on the opposite side. Annie picked up her own one and turned around. After swearing, she rushed out the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The other party will kill at any time, I will stop them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, You can't go alone..." Resistance slammed his tongue and got up and followed me and left the room in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first screaming was the outdoor guards, who seemed to be preparing for an assault but were caught off guard. Short firefights and spells rang outside the room under negotiation, slowly along the corridors and stairs. After a few minutes, the explosion also joined the symphony, and then the entire commander tower seemed to tremble slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie clenched his fist and began to do what he was supposed to do. She slowly stood up, mixed her breath, and listened to the outside. After the crossfire, she pressed her hand on the wall, tapping the wall with her finger, and whispering the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Communicate my voice, all the things connected to it... super deer extension, meden resonate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wide range of resonance magic is then spread across the walls of the fortress, and each brick becomes a loudspeaker. Everyone around me was holding her breath and waiting for her to speak, without making any noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough cough... can you hear it? This is a test."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie Coughing twice, all the walls responded with the same cough. She smiled and went to the window, looking at the flustered Fort Stilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First introduce myself, I am the Archbishop of Luther of the Innovation Society. I was in the city by the delegation of the Reformation Committee and the Kengal government. Come and save you, your faith, your country and your free soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire fortress is repeating what she said, soft, round, The magnetic neutral voice echoes in the corridors and underpasses, and people can't help but want to continue listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know it sounds hard to believe, but please listen to me a few questions. Think about how long you have not received a full salary. From what day, can you not get the real gold coins? I don’t know when, the pastors who listened to your confession started to talk unclear? How many times have soldiers who have devout faith or willing to think be treated inexplicably unfairly? In the past six months, what have you been doing with some of your officers? Recall, what are you doing here? Are you really fighting for the country, or being manipulated by the interests and ambitions of some people? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What you don't know is that in the past six months, Steelburg has been under the sinister conspiracy. The apostate who tried to undermine our devout faith took control of the fortress, they still have Hidden among you! They want our country to return to an era where only one religion is taught and people are not allowed to think freely! Fortunately, the plots of these apostates in the South have been defeated. But the enemies here are still I don't know how to converge, they still continue their evil plans!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out he intends to do this..." Listening to the sounds from the walls around him, Ionite Hartman knocked it hard, but the sound continued. He turned and asked: "Lion, you are better at dispersing and countering. Is there any way to interrupt this sound-sounding magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The petite Leon hurriedly approached the wall, and the palms glowed white, tapping the wall twice. "Sorry, Io, this is probably not to be dispelled - unless we find the caster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? He claimed to be the bishop, I thought it was Bragging." Listening to the instigation of the voice, Ionite’s brows wrinkled more and more tightly. "Everyone takes off the monk's robe and coat! Egru, the dean, is the nearest company to the commander's line?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Egru bent down, Look at the road signs written in the corner with a cipher. "The most recent is the 23rd barracks, where two companies are stationed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we will go. The chaos created by us, we don’t use it too. It’s a pity.” The purple knights took off their cloaks and revealed the uniform of the free army officer. "We are the staff officers who escaped from the Commander Tower and organized the rescue. You can testify, Lord Egru. All is for the safety and glory of the Emperor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The sable monks walked in the chaos and gathered all the guards that could be seen along the way. The city bricks vibrate and continue the speech they least want to hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One hundred years ago, in this land, people of different faiths killed each other. Justice was trampled, and only the power was rampant. Our ancestors obtained Victory, but they did not return blood, they forgive all those who do not want to change the tradition. They are soberly aware that only the most fanatical Orthodox, the most profitable hereditary aristocracy is our enemy. Regrettably, these people do not have the same tolerance. They use every means to try to reproduce the days when the blood flows into the river. At this moment, the apostates and traitors still try to control you. They are angering you, Try to keep you away from the right guidelines. No, don't follow them! Forget the loyalty to your superiors, think like a real person, ask your innermost conscience!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie knows that she is using a very dangerous weapon, but she has no choice. First of all, it is to erect a common enemy as a target...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw that the Orthodox Christians have reached the foot of the Commander’s Tower. I saw that the Empire was the fourth. The soldiers of the army have already crossed the Oslo River! They are conspiring to kill the commander of Steelburg and prepare to receive the fortress with the traitor. This is a fortress of freedom! This our predecessors used blood. The fortress you seized! This is a fortress that symbolizes a hundred years of hard work and sacrifice! How can we hand over this fortress that embodies the glory of the Freedom Army to the empire? Can you tolerate all this?!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused here and waved her hand at Nikola. The Shadow Master nodded and nodded, shaking the gun in his hand against the captives in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone immediately shouted with great enthusiasm: "No!" The voice sounded like the whole fortress was shouting together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie immediately picks up: "Yes, no! I believe in you, I believe in your honor, believe in your will! I saw you stand up Fight with enemies hidden inside and outside of us! Whether you are affiliated to the Law Society, Park Jihui, the provincial capital or the convention, whether you are a Protestant, an old or a single, you are asking your heart. Think about it. In the past six months, what have these people who are commanding you do? Think about what they are doing, does it really conform to the rules of the Free Army, or the conscience of a person? They are just Have you treated you? Did they give you what you deserve? Think about it! If the answer is 'no', don't follow them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nikolay A second round of pistol threats was carried out in due course. The "No! No! Never!" shouting is stronger than the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie’s fists are heavily on the table, and the tone is getting more intense: “All those who try to trample on your freedom will be evicted by the church and be The government of the Republic is expelled because they have forsaken their vows. Above the virtue of loyalty and obedience, there is a higher virtue, that is your conscience! You are the defender of the Republic, you are defending your hometown, Faith and freedom come to join the army, right? You are not fighting for your personal ambitions! Reject their orders and pay their weapons! Don't be afraid of them. General Piquet, the leader of these traitors, has been executed. No one will hold you accountable for this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At this moment, all the enemies are united and trying to stifle our resistance. At this moment, all the fears are gathered together, trying to let us fall without war. The enemy is inside us, outside us! In the name of the bishop, I authorize you to punish all apostates and traitors who dare to resist this takeover! All forces loyal to freedom, raise your four-color cross flag, stay in your position, and stick to your duties!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie raised his hand, and a huge four-color cross flag was thrown out of the commander tower and fluttered in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone has the right to punish those people, even if they are your immediate boss! This level of authorization is higher than the military law, higher than civil law, higher than all secular Law! No matter what you do today, you will be forgiven! If anyone tries to order you to resist this takeover, gather you without permission, you must resolutely oppose them! Repeat again, loyal to the troops of the Republic, obey the takeover, raise the flag ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly, the flags of one side and the other rise, accompanied by unstoppable gunshots and shouts. Fire and black smoke began to appear inside and outside Fort Stil, and it looked like a signal. Bonnie noticed that the recent barracks did not raise the flag. Her hand tapped on the wall and whispered the secret of the magic of the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, peaceful takeover is impossible... I hope that time is enough." Bonnie listened to the guns and sent a request to General Eugen’s headquarters for help. book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a good thing. If you can really solve all the problems by speaking and instigating...but it’s not so easy to solve.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to his sister’s speech, Anne looked out and looked at the commander’s hall at the end of the corridor. Several iron gates for defense in the corridor were put down, leaving only a few gaps that were only enough for one person to walk sideways, and they could barely see the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of soldiers just rushed in from outside the commander tower and subdued the Command Guard. These people gathered nervously under the leadership of seven or eight officers and appeared to be in the queue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t listen to his temptations! I saw these people killed our commanders and took control of the Commander Tower! They were premeditated!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An officer screamed that other officers controlled all entrances and exits. This team of men wearing military uniforms of various colors, mostly in yellow, and many other colors, looks like a force that has been put together. Several sergeants carried firearms and guarded the corridor facing them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny whispered: "We have put together more than 20 guns in this tower, and the enemy has easily lifted one company. They are late." If you don’t attack, are you going to block us here?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is correcting: “I’m afraid that there will be more than one company. The rest of the troops will probably be sent. Going to suppress the plan to respond to our army, or worse..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go open the door to meet the emperor? This is forcing us to attack." Anne does not know From where to find a few bullets pressed into the pistol of his pistol, squinted at the hall, shook his head and put down the gun. "No, the distance is too far, there are obstacles in the middle. This place is obviously designed to be melee. Use. Is there any plan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door looked at the length of the curved corridor and hesitated: "Is this the only way?" If you can launch a attack here and attack from the opposite side of the hall, it should be much better. However, we have not The half commander tower opposite the system..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, this idea is good. With my gun, you are responsible for organizing the attack." The blonde girl handed the pistol to him. There was a magical light on his hands. "I came up with a way to arrange the main attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was taken over the silver pistol, fiddled with insurance, and found the gun The structure of the machine is very different from what he knows. "Isn't this really a magic gun? It should be mechanically supported and looks very precise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic can't provide too high speed. 膛 line and gun The mantra on the body is a magical product. The special bullets are used to fight the magic defense. The power is not enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie retreats from him Take a few steps, hold the earlobe with your right index finger and whisper something. Her lips moved fast and anxious, and the door knew that it was a medium-difficult secret contact magic. He can also guess who she is contacting. Soon, the sound of the explosion from the Commander’s Gate and the snoring of the enemy officers confirmed his guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a dozen people ran out of the door, and after a burst of gunfire and explosions, they returned. Nanimen and Annie looked at each other with a tacit understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think there will be a better chance than now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Do you want to do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door quietly squeezed through the first iron gate, aimed at the second iron gate, and triggered the trigger of the "killer." The sudden huge recoil caused him to step back three steps and hit the first iron gate to stop. The power of the "killer" bullet far exceeds his imagination: it continuously penetrates the remaining three iron gates, leaving a huge conical hollow on each door. People's horizons are broadened. Resist the door to the ground and shouted loudly: "The volley!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the soldiers raised their guns and fired through the hollow to the hall. Anne even popped a dozen magical missiles at an unimaginable speed, and the number seemed to be supported by a chain of magicians. The officers who guarded the front of the corridor fell in the blink of an eye, and the remaining soldiers also had more than a dozen people who were defeated by this rainstorm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a firm command from the other end of the corridor. This is not the person who just gave the speech. This voice is much more powerful. It even overwhelmed the gunshots. "The enemy's firepower is strong, and the traps in the start channel are blocked!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic traps in the channel are sounded. The trigger wire was pulled off and a wall of flame suddenly appeared between the iron doors. These fire walls continue to burn, blocking the attack and vision of both sides. The door-to-door rolled out of the corridor and escaped from the corridor. The wreckage of several trigger lines broke his military uniform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The trap is too great, this road may not work, Anne!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, I am still afraid that they have no complicated traps. Are there any tools that are long enough? Wood sticks, iron rods, and spears are all right..." Annie looked around and found what she wanted in the hand of the Guard who had just arrived. I won it, "Oh, this is also a success."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do with it?" Seeing what Anne took in the hand, the door was awkward. "That is very important..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne handed the thing to her left hand and turned a deaf ear to his words. She stood on the side of the corridor, nodding her head at the width of the passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, in order to set up traps, here are the back seals, there is no metal and no anti-magic structure. The stone in front of it, changed back to its original The shape..." After the spell, her right hand, a heavy blow on the wall. "liquefaction" (liquef)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty of this five-stage magic itself is not very high, but few people can liquefy a huge object like a fortress. She is on the wall.
