The restaurant is elegant and suitable for important occasions such as dating, confession, marriage proposal, blind date, etc. If you and yours, or you and you, want to After a romantic evening, it is no better to choose here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above is the magic restaurant "Sunshine" published in the largest newspaper in Lenny, Mattebisi Introduction on the Times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you need perfect romance, please come to 'Sunshine'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1650 At the beginning of the year, similar words will appear in the monthly “Best Restaurant Selection”. Later historians believe that this is one of the earliest successful advertising cases. Every young man and woman wants to be able to date, confess, propose, and get engaged in the eve of the night. That is their wish... The desire is a wish, and the success rate naturally needs to be counted separately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it also includes the inconspicuous black-haired boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warm yellow light candle quietly hits the crystal turntable and the glass wall to create a warm tone that makes the diners feel at ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown when, the huge glass curtain wall quietly became opaque, only vaguely seeing the opposite. This design is to hide the romantic secret feelings of people. It’s really cheaper to use curtains, but the owner of Xizhao feels that it will lower the style of the magic restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy who is an orphan has no surname, only one name: Solitton (sol. This name is obviously just a matter of hand, the word itself has "lonely The meaning of this. Such a person, it should have been impossible to enter a high-end restaurant such as "Xi Zhao". Just because of his childhood girl, Nika; Lopez's father who has been separated for many years magically appeared, he has the opportunity to come here. Kind of place - her father Klad; Lopez is a lieutenant of the Free Army, a person with status and status.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he did not expect that he would For the first time in this elegant restaurant, I had a close encounter with a girl outside of Nika.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a clear green eye Beautiful girl with short blond hair and short shawl. Her height is not too much for him, and she is a tall figure among her peers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A touch of body Fragrant, uploaded from her body, it is slightly gentle and graceful, and carefree Romantic and fragrant. It is a bit like a lily of the valley, and a bit like jasmine; but it should still be the aroma of roses. It is not a artificially cultivated rose, but a wild battlefield rose with a hint of danger and wildness.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, her chest and body are close to him. The tight-fitting leather on her body makes her own perfect body more imaginative. The two were very tight, because the girl’s hand was holding his wrist tightly, which made him a little uneasy. What a romantic first encounter...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't seem to be a little uncomfortable, it is very uncomfortable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager smiled a bit and no longer wanted to deceive himself. He said The lips that are chapped by tension, the gaze is slightly downward: the shiny blade is placed next to his carotid artery. As long as the scimitar in the girl's hand is swept away, he can sweep his life.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did it become like this? Just because of a misunderstanding ... Soledon subconsciously grasped the black pistol that brought trouble, held his breath, and kept his body from shaking as much as possible.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can we talk? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to say this, but finds that he can't say even a single word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear. People call this fear. He knew that his face must be very ugly and stiff on this particular expression called "fear." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton once thought that he should be strong and brave... ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment when the blade was pushed to his carotid artery, his self-righteousness was completely collapsed. Those who have not faced the real battlefield cannot have such things as "strong and brave." Not everyone is the hero of the legendary hero story, the average person does not have the natural courage. This is a fact, but it is cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried it again. He believes that he should make a sound this time... but not. The girl's underdog behind it did not hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? This is impossible...he should have said it...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I repeat it. Take up the weapon, Clade; Lopez." The blonde girl lowered. Intonation, one word and one sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every word hits the heart of a teenager. For the sake of his own life, the teenager looked at the daughter of Seneca with a longing eager eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not shoot. Don't shoot, please! At least now he can't speak! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. As a lieutenant in the status of free army, I will not negotiate with the kidnappers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Even with Sorelton’s longing eyes, the expressionless lieutenant still pulled out the short sword. The short sword flashed a blue death light. It is not the death of the enemy, but the death of the hostage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, don't! Soledon gripped the gun and held it tightly, holding his palms and sweating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has no sense of existence, he is often overlooked wherever he goes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although his magical talent is very poor, he learned all the initial spells after six years of study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has no loved ones, there will be no more people crying for him after he dies - maybe the nuns and 黛妮卡 will drop a few tears? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the tears of a beautiful woman as an epitaph, it sounds cool... In fact, only one name is engraved on the tombstone because there is nothing to write. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he doesn't want to die, he doesn't want to. He still has a lot of conceit, many wishes, many goals that he wants to achieve, and many unrealistic delusions...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No way, then I have to cut off his Life is over." The blonde girl smiled very softly at him. "I feel very sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her wrists flicked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't...!" The screams of the teenager were suddenly interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't...!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton sat up from the bed, no Stop breathing. Is this heaven? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks around. Familiar furnishings, familiar rooms, familiar scenery. Here is the St. Grace's Welfare Home in Lenny, where he grew up, his home. Everything just now is just a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell of the joint parliament building came from a distance and the sound was two. The light in the room was very full, not two in the night; so the teenager got up from the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your face is very bad. To eat something, I will go to the teacher's clothing store to help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;His childhood, genius magic girl, 黛妮卡; Lopez left a note on the table; the words on the screaming magical light, it is particularly eye-catching. Soledon saw the magic and felt a little inferior. He can't even control this simple magic now. The teenager threw the note into the paper basket and scanned it. On his desk, there is also a box with two bursts of pistols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It proves that his dream is not entirely a nightmare, at least 90% is true. When he saw the box, he remembered the dispute last night and made him realize his dispute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To master powerful magic, you must have a firm spirit first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This The words are written in the magic notes of his magic teacher. Soledon had previously believed in his potential, but he now began to doubt his own determination. He has now discovered his own cowardice and timidity...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great discovery. What will I find next time? New world? Eastern route? he does not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncle Lopez is very strong. The teacher is also very strong. The fierce swordsman who exudes murder is naturally strong. The huge demon must be strong, and such a high-level magical technique certainly proves that its mistress is also very strong. What a very gentle half-elves? The boy can't see the strength of this person, but he thinks he is definitely not weak. Oh, of course, the beautiful sisters who have left a deep memory for him... They are naturally stronger than the weak ones. Being able to hold him hostage at a critical moment proves their courage and determination. Among all, he is the least capable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed the box and walked out the door. Today is cloudy outside, not too hot. The old buildings of the St. Grace's Welfare Institute have a special charm on a cloudy day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take the gun and give it to Renee... I don't deserve it."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinica is just his childhood...other than that, nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager reminds herself that she is Clade; Lopez’s only daughter, Clade; Lopez is Lieutenant General. One night, she became a noble lady. She is not an orphan, she is the only child of the lieutenant. She is a genius of spells, a genius of all spells, a true "blood genius." Even in Solerton's dream, Clade; Lopez is also emphasizing his bloodlines and identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he, what is he? There is a name, no last name. However, since he began to learn magic, many friends like to call him "Sorryton without spirit", as if "no spirit" is his name. He is looking forward to having a great life, but he also knows that this is almost impossible. He also has no talent, no future dawn of the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she is his childhood friend, she is perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he is her childhood, he has nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soledon decided not to think about these troublesome things and walked out of the welfare home. He felt that he should be optimistic and gratified because he did not develop according to his dream last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, in the reality of last night, Soledon did not say anything completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We... can we... talk?" Even though the teeth fought because of tension, he tried to make his own suggestion. "I think...this...maybe a...misunderstanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After saying this, he felt that the breathing rhythm of the girl behind her had changed slightly. She is thinking, a good start, Sorelton thinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I repeat it again, put away the weapon! Clad; Lopez, I will give you a minute to consider." The beautiful girl who is holding his hand hesitated, He did not pay attention to him; instead, he lowered his tone and repeated the threatening words to the generals there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager turned his gaze to Clade; Lopez; he was obviously struggling, but his hand did not leave the scabbard of the short sword. Teacher Yanmen was hesitant and seemed to want to persuade Clade, but he still didn't speak. The master of the recurve magic sword, full of murderous men, is casting a grateful eye to the girl here. The beautiful woman with the bright blond hair on her waist is busy getting her golden golem into combat preparation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst thing is. Klad; Lopez is obviously a long-awaited man... Soledon’s instincts tell him that this middle-aged man will not mind the sacrifice of his daughter’s childhood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... just set a time limit for time." The teenager calmed down his judgment and whispered to the girl behind him, "In fact, we both They are the Allies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her breath paused. Then, as Lan's breath rushed forward to his ear. "In a sense, maybe it is. Our purpose is to lift this misunderstanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, we have to stop Uncle Lopez from taking the shot together." He probably won't surrender to you... I bet on the possibility of 70%, he will still shoot." Sorelton's brain is running fast, thinking about the way out of trouble. The girl behind is also a smart and capable person... then persuasion may be effective. "I know him better than you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s breathing is a little bit rushed: "Do you mean...?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathing slowed down and she took a deep breath. "Can I believe in you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trust me. I will stop him from taking the shot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The answer came from the ear: "Let's try it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get promised, Soledon’s voice suddenly increased, "Sorry... Can I make a request before I die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak!" A firm, powerful, and rushing answer. Good acting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I... I have something to ask you, Uncle Lopez, not to let you compromise with them." Soledon tried to suppress the fear in his heart. Say a high-pitched line. "I will never give in to them...but if I am dead, I hope that you can transfer this gun to 黛妮卡."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen To the name of her daughter, Clade’s body jerked and the hand released the hilt of the short sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I originally wanted to use one with her..." The teenager noticed that the blade had slightly left his neck and raised the gun in his hand. Some, stroking and playing with this handle pistol. The gun body slowly turns to attract all the attention. "...but, I am afraid I can't do it. The rest of the matter will come to you, Uncle Lopez."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Without such pessimism, I will definitely rescue Yours..." Clade's hand left the scabbard, and the blue light slowly subsided. He slowly placed the short sword in the ground with the scabbard. "Well, I have put down my weapon, you can let him go, miss?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade loosened, and the girl’s breathing relaxed. The teenager knows that the opportunity is now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton adjusted the angle and slammed the pistol's turbine with his left hand! At the last moment before the launch, he hesitated and turned the barrel slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! Accurate gunshots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;铛! The sound of a short curved knife falling to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man seized the opportunity to break free from the girl's hand behind him and rushed forward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister!" Another woman’s exclamation, like the voice of a blonde girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job!" Clade; Lopez said, "Breaking dreams!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Blu-ray immediately re-emerges from the scabbard on the ground! For a time, everyone in this "sunshine" stared at the short sword scabbard on the ground that shimmered in blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oops!" Anne; Seifer squinted at her wrist. "Ultimately, can't stop this weapon from flying..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please stop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, the unremarkable boy named Soledon slammed into the blue Above the ray of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啧!" The body will sway, and the flying sword will be released. "What are you doing?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry... I promised to others...to stop you from using this weapon." The teenager took courage and knotted Baba said, "I think... this is just a misunderstanding. No need to do this. We... we can all sit down and talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" He is right." A clear male high voice, with a few applause. "This is really a misunderstanding, Lieutenant General.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All People are turning their eyes to the master of the sound.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf face is no longer pale, but instead is a sober gaze. The hangover magic finally has an effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are lucky, I would like to express my sincere apologies to my friends." His wording is a typical elf-like courtesy: polite and unruly. "I think, my friend may have some urge, after all, he is still used to his former career." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt a little proud: he might not drink as much as most elves. Maybe you can drink a little more in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, there is finally someone who looks easier to talk." Klad’s expression relaxed. "So, today is purely a Misunderstanding. I am very glad to meet you, Mr. Half Elf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lenard; Kakawi, former Elf fourth fleet, is now this Ms. Guard Captain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crad; Lopez, Temporary Lieutenant of the Free Army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The two hands are firmly held together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Are you two neglecting me?" Reza looked a little angry, "Kikawi! You turned out to be...!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, this is a genius 'the pure gold alchemist', respectable Reza; Ms. Hermont, my employer..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two people should meet now...? Maybe it will still have an impact..." Looking at it all in the distance, and directing all of Bonnie; Sephi Still worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, they will be allies sooner or later... well, should it be." Annie grabbed her hair and used a less steady tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it... Anyway, we have tried our best, even though we used a lot of magic, we finally managed to solve the problem..." Bonnie sighed long. Take a breath. Thinking that the two of them have changed so much detail, this extra detail is not expected to make things worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, sister, is your hand okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, even if he is true I couldn’t hurt me if I hit it.” Annie smiled. “Even if it’s really hit...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hesitated. The trace of the bullet hit is obviously deliberately adjusted in the position of the hand guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's a bit like Ke Wen; Sachman's style..." The sister said to herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well? Why did you suddenly bring up the president of the Arbitration Association?" Bonnie said. In the era from which they came from, Ke Wen; Sakuman was the most powerful magician organization on the ground, the president of the Magic Arbitration Association. This man is a door to the door; Hugh; Koman's disciple - although he died after he officially earned income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing. I just suddenly remembered that if the man was really resistant to the door; Hugh; Keman, then I just held it, it should be his pro-disciple. One of them." Annie smiled. "I feel that this man is really the one who is right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you serious? Sister?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You seem to have mentioned this question many times!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, A small storm ended like this. Most of them should soon forget this episode...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most people, should. Remove the culprits that caused the storm, the humble 18-year-old boy named Soledon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is afraid that he will not be able to get rid of this nightmare for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awakening from the memory, Soleton found that he had approached his destination unconsciously. He stopped at the high-end clothing store of the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is supposed to be a cheap restaurant, he wanted to solve lunch here, but now...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The wooden signboard of the restaurant is gone, replaced by a pure gold shiny signboard: "Pure gold women's interior store." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Opening a new store...?" He said to himself, walking to the clothing store in Naimen and decided not to have lunch at noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pleasant voice screamed at him. He didn't hear the sound, but it made him feel... very...very...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha?" The boy's scalp was numb and turned his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not the one last night...that...what is your name?" The speaker is coming out of the new store. It is a tall, tall, energetic girl with blonde hair with a shawl and a scimitar at the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This face, Soleton will never forget. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old gods, the Orthodox, the Protestant gods...or, oh my God, it’s really good... are you all pranks?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to scream a little, and immediately subconsciously looks around. Fortunately, there is no shadow of the fierce swordsman nearby... However, only this one holding a woman is enough for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call me Sorlayton." He replied cautiously, looking into the other's eyes. "And... see each other again."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl's green eyes are still so beautiful, lined with her blond hair, perfection is somewhat different from the real existence. Among her gaze, there are three points of appreciation, three points of sympathy, and four points... four points of confusion? I can only describe it like this, the boy thinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, meet again..." The blonde girl asked hesitantly, and the attitude and the one who held him last night was a world of difference. If it wasn't for Solerton who knew that their sisters had different hair color, they would have thought that this was the other of the twins. "Can you ask, your teacher is resistant... Isn't the door open here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The boy pointed at the top of his finger. Brand, "Here is written here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, thank you. I am Anne, Anne; Seifer. Since then we are neighbors, please take care of them in the future. The other side smiled slyly and gave him a slight 30-degree angle. "And... thank you for avoiding my hand when I shot yesterday. Well, thank you for obeying my agreement." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no thanks, this is what I should do." The teenager is red, think of yesterday's things, hurriedly bid farewell to her, fleeing Enter his teacher's clothing store. After all, out of fear and self-protection, he still betrayed her trust... He didn't dare to face her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne; Seifer smiled and watched his figure disappear into the next-door shop and turned into his new store. Today is the preparation for opening, there are many things to be busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorlayton, you are coming too late!" His childhood sweetheart, 黛尼卡; Lopez's anger rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the description of the MIB report, she is "a bad girl who seems to join the ranks of thieves or adventurers." Her height is derived from both parents, belonging to the petite and cute type, which is much shorter than the two men who are not burly. Her appearance can not be said to be extraordinary, but there is an unspeakable arrogant rebellious temperament. It’s like... it’s like a nobleman who runs away from home, or a princess with a arrogant character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton grabbed his head in a listless manner: "Oh, sorry, I overslept."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, are you going to use the name 'Sorryon without spirits'?! Get up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Teenagers and girls, men and women, from July 21, 1665, continue to live happily together...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is cloudy, so no There is no sunset after the sunset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is completely impossible to know that she is in front of a great era two hundred years later, mastering the magic beyond the times, enough to be A strong savior called the Savior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t know now, the woman in front of her, in the space and time she came from, is called the “Glory of the Golden Cross” and “The Soul of the Holy Empire” "The first place in the mainland" and "the strongest necromancer". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, he would inherit a great name, the meaning of which is "a person who does not exist." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, thirty years later, he will be honored by the Holy Emperor - become a member of the honorary royal family. His surname naturally became the name of "Hugh" plus the name of the Holy Coman Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
