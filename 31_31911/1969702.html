But if you want to destroy confidential documents that you haven't used yet, it's safe to use this natural flame. Although the magic of the flame is powerful, but often the enemy's clothes can not be burned, used to destroy the secret is always not so reassuring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Related to the destruction of all my operations. All logistical destruction. The tactical aspect can be left to the history department to repair the history... This tactic is destined to be destroyed, and it almost disappeared. Hey, there are still three boxes left, almost it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left-behind conductor of Jena Base Camp The officer’s last document was thrown into the fire, stretched out, stood up, and turned to call the guard who stood outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cap to take away the remaining confidential documents on the table. Arrange in the strongest defense."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander was dressed in a dark green cloak, and a pair of shoulders that were slightly slanted and slanted with a star-studded Major General. The female general is already unique in the Free Army, but her dress is even more memorable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the green dress of the French army, nor the special military dress that the old generals customized according to their origins and service experience. The young, over-elected female general dressed in a white silk female priest's suit, a pair of bare feet wearing translucent cold crystal boots, even the monotonous cloak of the color can reflect her cool and slender figure. Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two female sergeants are awkwardly packing up the table The files, stuffed them into a set of military folders, and laboriously stuffed these folders into a suitcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not used to this new job because they just got a new uniform that was not fit a few days ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "People's Pastor" badge on the chest of the two was just created, and it also flashed the kind of spectacle that was unique to the new magic items. Last month they were the parish priests of Protestantism, but I heard that the first bishop who reached the summit of miracles in the history of Protestantism, resigned from his parish faculty and rushed to Blenheim, and chased after coming to Jena to join. The army that was originally disdainful. The original title of the lieutenant was the famous female teacher, which was equivalent to the bishop of the Orthodox Church; the other was only the female priest, and she received the Shaolin epaulette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Major, the strongest defense power means..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The younger Oprah, who took out a marching plan from the documents he was about to keep, opened it to find the position on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is where I can see, stupid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary The folder in the hand gently hit the other's head, confidently said. Where she is, this is the most powerful location for this army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she is a nine-segment arcane and magical spellcaster Bonnie Sefer, one of the newest and most powerful top magical users in the civilized world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She does not have a bishop-level identification: no one in the Protestant can stratify a clergyman who can use "miracle" magic . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today's routine briefing should be here, bring it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two The female adjutant glanced at him and shook his head. The lower-ranking man hurriedly turned and ran out, and the female lieutenant bowed his head and apologized to Bonnie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's why we still have enough staff to use it." Bonnie interrupted her. "The loss of the Blenheim Army's military officers is very heavy. Lord Lopez needs to rebuild the headquarters of the Free Army. I’m anxious. Besides, you have been here for a few days. Do you think I dare to use the young officers who are not married to be the deputy chief of staff?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The nervous look on the face of Lieutenant Tailei disappeared: "You are right, those 'I am? The saints? The destined companion' majors are really difficult to deal with. The light from the French army these days Two lieutenant colonels, sixteen majors, seven captains, and more than forty lieutenants and ensigns. By the way, the vast majority are unmarried."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This number is somewhat out of Bonnie's expectation: "The sixteen majors. According to this ratio, the third freelancer stationed in the capital of Famos has no unmarried officers. How much do they like the 'virgin'? What is the name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not only the camp officer, the division staff I ran away. I checked the preparation form yesterday. I am afraid that the 30-year-old and the unmarried are all in our camp." Lieutenant Tailei thought and added, "And not only the third division." Yesterday, four officers came to report in the middle of the night. They came from the ninth and eleventh divisions and rushed for a whole week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Nine 'Gunshan' division and the eleventh 'Wildness' division? Are these two divisions still deployed on the Fas-Fergota ceasefire line?" Bonnie said, "From the front of the Figota tower to here." It is only a week away from Dongshan Mountain Avenue. It is definitely a day and night. It is a Frenchman who worshipped the goddess since ancient times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "They ran out on the day of the ceasefire, and they also took a formal order approved by their commander... The French people are not good at fighting or doing theology, but the action on the pursuit of women is really scary. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the time is up, then the military government has not approved Let's go to the thirteenth division. Let them go. Anyway, they have no chance in me. I will let them understand this through staff deployment.” Bonnie smiled. “It is estimated that after a period of time. I started to attack you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sigh sighed and forced the documents into a neat bundle: "If there is a suitable man, I am also I don't exclude the other half who are pious for the development of the church. After all, I am almost thirty years old, and I am only an acting teacher. I am afraid that even my own church will not be able to get married. Of course, they want to chase the Lord Bishop, you really have some self-sufficiency..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, the female adjutant secretly took a look at Bonnie, ok The archbishop’s sentiment was good and he continued to ask: “That, you said that they have no hope, is it that there is already a certain 'hope' Mr.? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie's lower lip twitched, but she immediately recovered her calmness. She asked: "Oh? Everyone can't help it, ask you to confirm the rumors? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I just want to let some of you privately disclose some information, so that some people can retreat. So I only asked the question when Oprah was absent. At least throughout the church, everyone is talking about your various legends, and I hope you can understand... After all, we are just gathering to build a greater new church around you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie smiled: "Everyone is wondering why I didn't go to the special military and political meeting in Fort Worth." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, and we all guessed that it was because of the new hero of Fort. He refuses to say anything like you, but there are too many people who have heard the legend of 'Lonnie's Heroes'. Coincidentally, the miraculous girl is also surnamed Safir, which is hard to say is a coincidence. No matter how you listen, it’s like you, the Archbishop.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the old unmarried young woman, I’m looking forward to it. Eyes, Bonnie felt a little headache with her hand, and I didn’t know what to say.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister, sister, you really left me A lot of trouble. Ok, I know, I will quickly sneak into Lenny to collect your memories and send them to Interre to do the memory transfer... Who left the trouble, who will clean up. "Britney is also a little embarrassed. After all, the war has been over for more than half a month, and she did not dare to go to Lenny to collect her sister's memory.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When can I rush to Lenny?... But should there be no big problem with a delay of one or two months?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie is with herself and her sister. The secret shelter set up by Interre is still very confident. It is not so much a shelter for the body of a magician, but rather a maze of security. In order to preserve the experimental results of the future magic technology, and some devices reconstructed according to future technologies, they are hidden in the manor, and the fighting power of many magic and magic creatures is not lost to the golden golem of Reza Hermont. And there is a considerable amount of artificial intelligence. To break the manor, at least two or three regiments of troops and the same combat magician are needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her silence made the adjutant more misunderstood, and Lieutenant Tailei began to guess Bonnie’s thought: "Do you want to expose this identity? Just like when you used 'Pluto? Luther'... Or are you not satisfied with the pursuer? It is already the youngest major and high-ranking magic officer of the entire Freedom Army. Take these people too much, it is difficult to find a more promising man who matches you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie suddenly spoke and interrupted Her wild guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you match? Does it look like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like you It’s really rare to reach such a person so young. I can only think of the double-excellent chapter that I can deserve it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" If I said that the new hero loved my twin sister?" In the half, Bonnie shook her head. "Forget it, when I didn't say it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Bonnie has seen the look of the female adjutant. That is the general look of the tabloid reporter who caught the star scandal. There are always things that transcend the times, she thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was at this moment that a knock was heard. The second lieutenant finally got back to today's briefing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, this is the letter of appointment from the Fortune in the morning and the special meeting of the military and political affairs. Also, the special envoy of the emperor has arrived, what should we do? Dealing?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie sighed and patted the shoulders of Lieutenant, ending the conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can collect so much information and rumors, you are not doing this adjutant work well, Tailei Lieutenant. Keep going, everyone It is from the frequent mistakes. The work is also, the faith is also."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took the file in the hands of the Oprah, and untied the seal magic, began reading . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell me the situation of the imperial envoy. Who is the person who presided over the handover work and the exchange of prisoners of war?" The general said, while turning over the routine notice in his hand, he asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The other party claimed to be the Duke of Fegota. The negotiator of the negotiator that we sent back last time is her adjutant, it should be right."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Duke of Fegota? Who? The old duke should have no more blood relatives." Bonnie scratched her head. "Oh, I remember I took over Jena defense." At the time, I saw a von Fegota Brigadier in the combat record. Is she, which family has passed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, let me see ..." The younger Oprah looked at the palm of his hand. "They said that the full name of the new female duke is the Duke of Veronica? Von? Fingota. The intelligence officer said that she is the adopted daughter of the old duke, and cannot completely exclude the illegitimate Female's possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie's fingers froze on routine notifications. In this name, a part of the thoughts sounded the alarm in her memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a memory of this era, but part of what she knows as "future history." Bonnie Sefer and her sister come from a different future than this era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Repeat it. Are you talking about 黛卡卡维伦? If I didn't guess wrong, the lady should be less than twenty years old? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the female Duke of Veronica? Von? Fingota. The spelling is, d..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quickly flipped through two pages and rubbed her fingers on the report, just like the ink was smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jonica Vernon. Duke of Fegota. This is really, really...very interesting."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young and beautiful Archbishop suddenly laughed aloud, with a hint of madness in his laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right, Anne. There will be a reaction. I am a daughter of Dinica? Ironic?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two adjutants looked at each other and quietly and patiently waited for Bonnie to return to normal. They just quietly remembered the words of the Archbishop who were unclear, but did not express surprise. For a pastor who stands at the top of theology, any doubt is unnecessary. It is those who have abandoned the secular and rules to think about the source to reach the end of the faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is why Bonnie chose her adjutant from the priests. Good priests have good patience and are the most trustworthy people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, she finished all the briefings and picked out three of them, and all of them were thrown into the fire and burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This appointment was handed over to the magician responsible for the delivery of the pigeon, and she was passed back to the headquarters of the New Liberty Army in Fort Vatican. I accept this appointment. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She signed a name on one of them, and the other two broke into her arms." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, let's go see the messenger who exchanged prisoners."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* ********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of white flags are flying over the entire Jena camp, embroidered with a brand new golden emblem. Together with countless green Republic of the Republic of Muse, they look down on these camps and huts that are about to be abandoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the flag of the thirteenth freelancer, the "miracle" division. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the ceasefire agreement came into effect, the commander-in-chief of the Freedom Commander, Commander-in-Chief Krad Lopez, left most of the supply and instructed Blenheim’s The women formed a new unit capable of deterring the emperors of Rennie and the elves of Blenheim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the signature of the Virgin, Bonnie used the broken soldiers and the priests and officers who took the initiative to form a new army. This is the thirteenth. The teacher "miracle." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new freelancer has already scheduled to take over the position of the third "French" division to take over the Eastern Front Reserve. It is because of the existence of this army that Marshal Lopez dared to go to Fort Vatican to participate in a special military and political meeting that decided on the future of the free nations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a force that is completely owned by Major General Bonnie Sefer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young female major is not in a hurry, just let the commander arrange the Duke of Fegota and her entourage to meet the prisoners who are ready to exchange, and Send people to meet the prisoners of war who returned from the elves and the Fegota prison camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie took the guards from the camps of one after another camp, and all the passing guards took guns to pay attention to her. She deliberately slowed down and let the crowd have time to gather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the team progressed, more and more soldiers and civilians gathered along the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are facing her figure, shouting slogans such as "Long live the thirteenth division" and "Long live the miracle", the sound is getting louder and louder. It’s like picking up the entire camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Miracle" is a new church that is self-contained by Bonnie's clergy, and its members are rapidly increasing like snowballs. Every Protestant pastor dreams of establishing his own church and retreat, and the appearance of Bonnie gives them the best shot. The Blenim Army was originally built on the basis of the caster, and the "Miracle" gave them a formal organization. Although they have just been combined, they have shown great potential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wave passed to the empire and Sansen representatives who had just arrived at the location of the captive exchange ceremony, and more than one person changed his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that the young lady of Blenheim's virginity had previously established a church in the army as a man. This is just that she took the power under the table."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I have the ability to use miracles, I can also build a retreat. Isn't that great?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Just bragging, a priest who can use miracles! Such a person is not a direct agent chosen by God, is his own mind and belief completely different from ordinary people, depends on you?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two rows of elf messengers behind me and the whispers of the imperial messenger were also introduced into the ears of 黛卡卡维伦, making her mouth slightly distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this to show off their strength to us? Bonnie Seifer is this person..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 leaned on the bench and tried to remember the previous memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The signing ceremony of the exchange ceremony was deliberately set up in a Protestant church. The representatives of the South and the representatives of the North sit opposite each other. The representatives of the Elf sit in the Imperial Diplomat. The next one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the execution column outside the church, the body of the person who committed the felony of the abuse of magic since the establishment of the magic net, no doubt is to give the empire Everyone has a "deep impression." Although the young woman who is in charge of this place is young, she does not lack the iron fists she deserves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of this new force is equally impressive: Protestant pastors control every corner of the church, and the collars on each collar prove that they can Use divine magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best organist in the South, Meti Crosso, arrived here early and played beautiful organes for the delegates - as long as the conditions are right Music can become a powerful magic enough to shoot down a dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no evidence, Renee believes that Bonnie Sefer is the same person she knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 is not impressed with the girl who works every day in the next door shop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She only remembers that her sister, Anne, is a pretty girl who is sometimes stupid and sometimes amazingly sharp, attracting attention and an active atmosphere no matter where she is; The younger sister is always hidden under the shadow of her sister, and rarely shows her likes and dislikes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In retrospect, I think that I’m afraid that she deliberately wants to impress others: a pastor who can use miracles can never be a sweet Keep a low-key person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-ranking pastor is very strange, only two characteristics are the same: First, they and their personality must be very different from ordinary people. Second, although they are different from their ordinary people, they all have unusual personality charm. A top mage may be a person who has nothing to do but IQ, but a top priest is never possible. The best preachers can make public opinion like God Kai, and all the listeners below will not be surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...is really a man who can’t see through. The woman is disguised as a man, she killed all the Fegota nobles and deliberately Her own troops were transferred to Faures. Did she want the entire Pyganta Principality?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isis Megnan beside her I almost nodded with the same sympathy: "This person is really difficult to see through. But to say that her woman dressed as a men's Bruto Luther, the security department has a lot of analytical information."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ninja has turned his head and relentlessly satirized: "Is she found to be a woman dressed as a man?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No...no." The former ace agent had a reddish face. "But even if all the characters about the character are lost, the rest is quite useful. From the beginning, the Ministry of Security did not believe it." This young senator will be in his position. It turns out that he did use the victory and defeat again and again to a major general. In the end, I finally stood in the position of one of the commanders of the main force of the Free Army. We originally estimated that after we took Lenny, the ambitious Bruto Luther might even choose our side, after all, before him. The position is <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Kingle represents the Member', and now the area he represents is under our control."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis nodded. "That makes sense. Bonnie Seyphile wants to be a local power, only to choose the Principality of Fegota as her goal of expansion. The Pyganta Principal is indeed the entire border. The biggest weakness on the line, the emperor will not really support the strongest duchy, and the Duke of Sotalan, who is in charge of the command of the East Road, is not interested in building a strong Principality of Figota."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So there will be these horses today, right." Renee smiled coldly. "This new neighbor is really ambitious..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden sound suddenly inserted into the conversation between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think so. In fact, Miss Sefer is also a good girl. Maybe she just wants to make friends?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinica jerked his head and slammed into the conversation with the rushing speaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man clasped her neck with her arms, and the Duke could barely breathe. Reneka recognized the coming person almost immediately from this movement, struggling to shake off the pure flame that the right hand was ready to. The elves behind them nervously whispered and introduced the uninvited guest to the envoys who did not know the coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is?" "The sister of the human emperor, the first princess Olia Hugh Coleman, the prisoner of war exchange table ranked first "I want to wear the blue uniform of the Free Army?" "Maybe a prisoner of war?" "Other prisoners of war have not worn the uniform of the Free Army, just prisoner..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Princess Olia ignores these arguments, just clinging to the shoulders of Yanika. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Senior! You are finally back! I know you will pick me up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; As a Conan of the orthodox blood, the strength of her arms is so great that even if she struggles, she can only squat in the arms of the Princess. Feeling the itchiness of the long black hair on the cheeks, smelling the smell of some of the first princess's head oil, the female duke finally could not help but ask for mercy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, you, your hair... How many days have you not washed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence really produced a miraculous effect. Olivia Hugh Coleman let go of her hand and subconsciously touched the bangs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not too long, from the time we broke up last time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the tone was understated, the princess of the empire still looked away. After all the time, Itis was shocked. "It’s been more than half a month! Is it a malicious torture by the Free Army?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They have provided bath water according to their officer standards, but I It’s useless.” Olia looked down at the Free Army uniform and honestly said the truth. “They asked me to return this dress to them, but I wanted to bring this military uniform back to the empire and refused. The bathroom they provided. In addition to this non-requirement, Major General Bonnie was a good person. I did not find any violation of the POW."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis Opened his mouth, but did not say anything. The female agent who once served as the officer of the Free Army wrote on the face the phrase "requiring you to return the uniform of the Free Army." However, when I was reluctant, I remembered the origin of this military uniform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This piece won't be...the military uniform that day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes Then the imperial princess solemnly and loudly added, "This is what my favorite man gave me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All heard this sentence The words of the person couldn't help but lean back, and the organist of the organ lost his hand and pulled out a full chord on the keyboard. The elf envoy took out his notebook and wrote something on it with the fastest speed, but the expression on his face had long been twisted into a ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I had to break this embarrassing silence by Renee: "Are you serious, Olivia? The person you like is not suitable." Say it here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olivia shrugged: "Yes, the person I like is the double master of Lenny's, the door to the door? Major Major. There are hundreds of girls in the South who want to marry him, not one more?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How does this story sound like a romantic comedy?” “If you let the human emperor hear it, it’s not a comedy.” “I think Gustav heard it more comedy, his sister chasing to marry. Give a Southerner." "But to say, maybe the ceasefire agreement can be maintained for some time?" "There is also a shining star of the Free Army. Who can look even more ugly?"<br /><br />&nbsp People talked passionately, exchanged information and rumors that they knew, and talked about this romance of the First Princess of the Empire and the Hero of the Free Army, even the "Commander of the 13th Division!" The announcement did not interrupt their talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonnie’s Guardian Lieutenant Tailei is a bit annoyed. She cleared her throat, and the index finger and middle finger of her left hand quickly formed a prayer gesture on her chest, ready to repeat it again with the amplified version. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her sergeant gently cocked her index finger and stopped her, and walked silently along the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold crystal boots stepped on the old wooden floor of the church, causing a cool chill, and the heat of the summer heat dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major General Bonnie Sefer walked through rows of benches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people on the bench consciously stopped the noisy conversation, while unconsciously staring at her back, a few came from the northern line to meet the new woman The Fergutta officer, the Grand Duke of the Duke, subconsciously pressed his hand on the weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the woman in front of her has put on a full set of official dresses, she is a hero, but everyone still remembers the afternoon of the final day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the bloody woman who killed all the heirs of the Pegota Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Bonnie’s own eyes have been firmly locked behind Jenny’s. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new female duke is shaking her head and talking to Princess Olia. From the perspective of Bonnie’s observation, I can also see that the adjutant of Renee’s card is constantly pulling the clothes of the Duke’s clothes. Even so, Reneka did not go back, but continued to whisper and the princess argued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie paused and looked at the side of Yanika. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she was also called Janica Lopez, Bonnie had seen her many times. Although it is not a good friend, it cannot be said to be a complete stranger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, Bonnie didn’t really know who she would be. After she became Jenny Viclen, Bonnie was the first to see "her". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...should not be the first time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie from a distant In the memory, the embossed side image with metallic color is compared with the girl in front of me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Renee, looks more like a sideways figure in her memory than a friend that Bonnie knew in Lenny. On the sideline, the nickname is about thirty years old, and she is a little more temperament and charm than the current girl version; but the sharp edge is like a sharp edge, the micro-volume brown hair, the slender eyelashes, the indifference The bright eyes seem to be no different from the current female duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""" is the grand duke of the empire, or the grand duke of Figueta, the head of the five major dukes... Gustav picked up She? Is he also crossing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonyka? Weilun’s half-body looks like the best sculptor from Bonnie’s era, It will be engraved on the back of every piece of Xinzhou Jinyuan and Silver Dollar. In the era when she lived, it was the best currency in the world. In the years when the old empire was shaped like waste paper and the currencies of several new countries had not yet appeared, Bonnie saw these coins from the New World every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fire that she ignited almost burned the entire old world. Her strength and ambition almost burned out the new world that was just born." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the history known to Bonnie, Seneca Weilun will lead the War of Independence in New Koman, Free Islands and East China Sea, and will eventually These scattered colonies are unified into one. Bonnie can even recite the conclusion of Ionite Hartmann in the seventeenth century volume of Modern History. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie never let anyone know that this paragraph is actually her favorite part of the whole "Modern History". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not bother the princess and the Duke’s conversation, but silently recited Hartman’s evaluation of the woman in front of her, until the two finally found the entire church. The atmosphere is not quite right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How suddenly is it quiet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alia also touched the back of the head and asked , 黛nica immediately understood what happened. The female duke bounced from her seat and took the adjutant, who was pulling her horn, and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bonnie..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how to call each other. Calling the Archbishop is unacceptable to the Orthodox Church. Calling the Major General or the Master will dissatisfy her own Figotas. After all, this woman is the enemy of the entire Pyganta Principality. I can call the other person's new assignment, and she doesn't know what this new position is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I have no choice but to say a word of help: "...has been gone for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I should say... long time. This should be the first time I saw Yanika? 'Wei Lun'?" Bonnie slightly tilted her mouth and pretended not to hear the other party's words. Ironically, reaching out to the imperial envoy, "Welcome back to Jena, the Duke of the Duke. Congratulations on the promotion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is really what you give. The entire Pyganta Principality will not forget your kindness, Bonnie...” Yanika frowned and asked straight out. “I guess I should also congratulate you on your promotion. Your new position. What is it, Bonnie, or Lord Bonnie?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie also heard the irony in these words. Her eyes turned and she signaled that the guardian who had been for a long time had answered the question for her. Under the influence of the sound-amplifying magic, this reading can be heard throughout the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the thirteenth freelancer 'miracle' Major General, the commander of the Northern French Muse Theater and the French sergeant, each of which is jointly owned by the Faith Church Acknowledgement of the Archbishop, Lord Bonnie Sefer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard this long list of titles, Itis, who served in the Free Army Take a sip of cool air. Both Nineika and Olia were not very clear about the system of the free country. The former staff had to be close to the two and whispered to the meaning of the appointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the previous few free wars, the position of the Free Army to fight against the Parliamentary Appropriations Committee was to supervise the military. The Warlord was the equivalent of the Regional Finance and Military Director. Responsible for the formulation of the collection plan, the issuance of public debts, the provision of temporary taxes, and the provision of military expenses to the troops. This position will be authorized only in very urgent circumstances. The South has not established this position for almost 40 years."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Warlord is responsible for the collection, transfer and transshipment of military expenses, and the commander of the theater is responsible for the preparation and command of the troops. If both positions are assigned to the same person, then it is not big. Is the Duke almost the same?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliya said everyone’s voice, and Nika was more acutely aware of the potential contradiction in the appointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why has this appointment been passed? Is your military and political conference not still open? Do you want to be a warlord? There is a strong world in Fort Worth. The power of the seven Red Army fleets, and the remaining nine freelancers are there. But you are not there. Why is this? Or... why you haven’t arrived in Fort. This appointment was sent out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ninja did not hesitate to spit out the poison tongue, she would not let go of every opportunity to suppress the reputation and morale of the other side. After all, the Northern French Muse military area is close to her Pyganta Principality, and she does not want to have such a dangerous neighbor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, then why is the Duke of the Duke here? As far as I know, in order to divide our enemy-occupied areas, the great aristocrats of the empire are not Are you working overtime to get to Lenny?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny has a look that doesn't matter: "Your provocation is useless. We are Fegota Everyone agreed that we should complete our military obligations to our Majesty as soon as possible and rush back to our territory to bury several deceased dukes and marquis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a coincidence that I have the latest information here, from the north, maybe the Duke of the Duke will be interested." She shook the information in front of several imperial people. "It’s about the vassals of your country." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis screamed "ah" and his eyes moved to one side. Renee felt a little uncomfortable and glanced at her before she focused her attention on the information that Bonnie had. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just glanced at her face, and her face changed like Isis. Olia also curiously got together, and her expression became very embarrassing. Bonnie coughed and read the text above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The three Marquis of the Pegota Principality, eleven counts, and sixty-two viscounts, barons and quasi-barmen declare that they do not support this succession, Nor does it accept the sovereignty of the Duke of Monica Vernon von Fegota, who believes that this inheritance was a conspiracy of the emperor to try and swallow the Principality of Fegota, and they asked the emperor to declare that it was absolutely not for any reason, including marriage. And any form of succession to seize the sovereignty of the Pygatuit Principality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 took a deep breath, clenched his fist and released it. She told herself hard that she had estimated the possibility of this situation, but did not expect to be revealed in this case. But she must not panic. If she can't even support it here, how can she do the Duke of Fegota? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lineup is really gorgeous, this is almost all the vassals responsible for the Eastern Front battle, Magna Nanqing."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis retired half of the body and said: "There are still some people who did not participate in this conspiracy, my Duke of the Duke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Princess Olia added: "If I remember correctly, the commander of the East Road Corps is the Duke of von Sotalan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Good. Sotalan is really waiting to ask for his war bonus... then let us bring it back to him. I would like to see if anyone wants to obstruct our Figota! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛尼卡? Wei Lun looked provocatively at the opposite of Bonnie, posing a posture that would now destroy the prisoner-swapping exchange ceremony. If she didn't guess wrong, the other party should not want to destroy the ceremony, and she will definitely cooperate with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie squinted and thought, in a low tone: "I feel sorry for the crisis in your Principality. We are neighbors in the future." If there is any need for help, please be welcome, despite the opening. After all, your country has lost several heirs in succession, there should be a lot of difficulties."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the Free Army, a burst of laughter broke out, and more than one Figotas began to pull the sword. Bonnie Sefer personally killed the three heirs of the Principality of Figueta, and would actually say this here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ninja’s face flashed a touch of cyan, his right hand stroked in the air, and yelled: "With 黛妮卡维伦?Feng Fegota In the name of the name, I command you all to sit down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Ding Dangdang came, the nobles who pulled out the sword sat on the ground, even Yi Tess also sat down in front of this group of commanding magic power, and Bonnie's several Guardian women officers were no exception. In the entire church, there were only three people standing in Olia, Yanika and Bonnie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My vassals are a little excited, let the governor make the ladies look at the jokes. They are not intentional, please forgive me."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is said, the expression of 黛尼卡 can be completely without a single request for understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also, thank the Governor for the military to inform me of this important information, I will remember."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Although the other party’s attitude is very bad, and the technique is very provocative, but Nika knows that, in essence, Bonnie Seifer told them that the information is helping them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More on the deeper level, why did the empire’s intelligence system not send this news? There are too many places to think about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said the last sentence, just to inform the other party, she, 黛妮卡薇伦, already understood Bonnie’s goodwill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie did not go on, but her words clearly left behind the introduction of improved relations in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 looked at her figure, thoughtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She patted Olivia’s shoulder and asked, “Princess, do you think she really intends to be friends with us?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." Olia replied, "But how do I say, I think she is like you. If it weren't for the past, maybe you can be good. Friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your intuition is terrible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real Prisoners Exchange Agreement The signing ceremony was not shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the entire ritual, I have been assessing the possibilities of the future. Bonnie is a very rational and flexible person like her – in other words, can communicate. The Duke did not know how Bonnie knew her thoughts, but it was indeed her idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks at the last agreement that symbolizes the formal entry into force of the ceasefire agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace is coming, although it is a chaotic peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic net has been established. Peace may be longer than everyone imagines and long enough to change the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡? Wei Lun suddenly felt that in the coming era of peace, having such a neighbor is not necessarily a bad thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least, it’s not necessarily worse than the empire of von Sotalan, Gustav or the Great Wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking like this, she signed the name "Jenica? Weilun" on the handover treaty, and then covered Feng Fegota Family crest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The heroic soldiers and noble officers of the army will arrive soon." She stood up and took the initiative to reach out to the opposite side. "Then we I have to say goodbye."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wish a good trip." Bonnie also extended her right hand. "Right, I still have an intelligence from the South, maybe. The two will also be interested. It is the last little bribe that comes with it, it is the news that has just been sent. Yes, Princess Olympia is also best to come over, this information is estimated to be of interest. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial princess squeezed from the back: "Bonnie, I don't care about government and military affairs, and I have no interest in them. Don't expect me to help." What are you taking advantage of from my brother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, you will be interested. The Fort Top meeting proposed the names of my new colleagues, they I am asking for my opinion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie? Seifer plucked another piece of paper from her arms in the empire The two female nobles with the highest status swayed in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Temporary Military and Political Conference is about to nominate the Special Envoy of the Extraordinary Power in the Republic of Intresas..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Renee read the first half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Nike Gate? Major Soledon, so ask for your opinion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Oria read the second half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they reacted, they found that their hands were not tightly grasped on the same piece of paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie hesitated and loosened his hand slightly reluctantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the pulling power is too large, the good parchment "stinging" was torn out a big hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Olia and Janika looked at each other and saw a blush on the other’s face. Reneka loosened her hand as the electric shocked, and Olia did not hesitate to rob the entire appointment book and stuff it into the inside of the jacket like an adventurer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
