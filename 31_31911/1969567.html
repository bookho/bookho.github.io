			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xvii<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have a dream?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard; Kakawi had a dream when he was 19 years old. That year, his human mother, who had fallen into the dust, stayed in the port of Elowi because of the disease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was only forty pounds when she died. Just like in a fairy tale, she believes that the elf who once loved each other will come back to pick her up. A beautiful love story always sings love, and no author has ever mentioned the disease that spreads around the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard does not believe in fairy tales, but he believes in dreams. His dream is to become a true elf aristocrat. He is determined to one day be above the blood of his father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, he joined the Nassen Navy, became a sailor, and then became a sea sergeant and became a sea otter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But dreams are still just dreams. He is now farther and farther away from his dreams... he can't touch it far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you ever imagined the way you died?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard; Kakawi I have thought about it occasionally. The most ideal way is to die as an elf aristocrat, and then leave a strong stroke in the history books of the world. Because half-elves have a long life, old and dead is also a great thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t have the chance to die, it’s not bad if you can die when you are mentally prepared. When a person dares to face death and has what he wants, death is a magnificent tragedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he never thought that he would die with a pirate at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have a dream?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kezmi; Stewart wants to do it now The number one pirate king. Of course, this is not his childhood dream, because there is no strange uncle to give him a straw hat and other things to agree on his future life, and also lack of a boss who is a pirate group at sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, Kazmi’s dream is two words: making a fortune. He has worked in the Juzhou Islands for many years and has done business for many years - but he has been betrayed many times, be robbed by others, even being pirated, sitting in the Governor's Office of Elven Intercontinental The big prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the prison, he met a warrior who was convicted of death and taught him how to use a samurai sword. From the prison, Kazmi, who had nothing left, decided to really be a pirate. He went to do this and found himself talented in this area, so he did it. At least it can be expected to betray others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, pirates are free and unrestrained. He always thought that one day, he would open up a small town of his own in the tropical jungle on the coast of Nanxinzhou. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you ever imagined the way you died?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kezmi; Stewart Si often thinks, especially when he has just started the pirate line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirates not only kill, but also kill each other. On the same ship, between the same fleet and between different fleets. There is an oriental proverb that says, "People sitting on the same boat will help each other." From the standpoint of pirates, this proverb is completely nonsense. The nation that compiled this proverb must be a nation without sea life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best ending is to finally have the opportunity to get out the treasures that you have buried yourself, and then live a safe life, instead of making those treasures cheaper. Treasure hunter. The next time, it can be caught by the government and then beheaded as the greatest pirate king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he did not even think about going with the captain of a small anti-private ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Butterfly and butterfly meet and want each other to change each other's destiny forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the pirate captain and the captain of the sea corps are handed over to the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was a faint white light flashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge reaction force hits Kazmi’s hand as if there is a strong and determined force blocking his attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirate captain’s arm is subconsciously energized, the small arm is violent, and the blade is not able to stab into the opponent’s heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His blade is slippery, and the body of the half-elf is flashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learnard only felt that the left front chest was pushed by people. From the heart, there was no pain in the expected. There is no feeling at all, only a huge driving force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a thorn that the other side went all out, and Leonard’s slashing his sword slid away from the enemy’s throat. The red stiletto tip trembled twice, quietly stopping next to the pirate's throat, but did not scratch it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't get in?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't die?!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They realize the result, that is, after a short time. This ending is completely beyond the estimates of these two experienced warriors - that can never happen naturally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are magicians? It is a magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kezmi is puzzled, but Leonard has understood the identity of the shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why will she save me? Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is arranged by Saint Sen or the Holy Empire The possibility of reinforcements was immediately removed by him - it is impossible for such a strong Master to accept such an outrageous task. If there are hidden reinforcements, the possibility of escorts in those Principalities is still relatively high. Only the enemy will arrange such a midway inserter at any risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is it for to keep him a life? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lingguang flashed Leonard’s mind: “Break the mouth...?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s obvious This protective magic is to ensure that the pirate captain is killed with his hand. Then, he can be killed at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt a chill on his back. The other party is carrying out a strict conspiracy that never allows any variables, and everything must be planned as planned... If his level is lower, it is really impossible to find out the existence of protective magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one kind of countermeasure - the enemy wants, absolutely can not give the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shakes his sword and stays on Kazmi’s throat: "Don't lose your knife, you can't win."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The samurai sword landed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you kill me?" Katzmi asked desperately to drop the knife. There is no chance of winning with an enemy with powerful protective magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I admire your strength." Leonard bowed his sword and took it to his waist, then withdrew his sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, fake and false." Katzmi spit a slobber. "Isn't you want to use me to change the bounty?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard took back the fine sword and pointed to the body of a sea soldier on the ground. He whispered: "You want to follow this with you. But I can allow you to wear my soldier's uniform." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kazmi was a little surprised and asked in disbelief: "You are serious...?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course it is serious." Leonard replied faintly. "People like you should not die here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen To his words, Katzmi; the expression on the face of Stehaus is uncertain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thriller, doubt, confusion, incomprehension, curiosity, want to believe but can't believe...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;When she heard this, Leonard was in a hurry - after all, he didn't know when the female mage would tear the camouflage again and destroy the man's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it and removed the samurai sword from his waist. "So, take this weapon back and use it for self-defense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kezmi stared at his weapon, his complex look, stepping back: "You Is this despising me, half-elf? I have admitted to losing to you, and I am prepared to be your prisoner. What do you mean by this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;莱Nader smiled bitterly: "This is because you are not willing to put on our military uniform, I have to return the knife to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the words, Kazmi Finally completely stunned. He closed his eyes and thought for a long time before he came back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You may be a great hero who is too good, maybe a traitor, I don't know. But I know, you are the first." People who believe in me so much. Please allow me to express my respect for you in my own way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirate captain quietly took his weapon and slammed it Knife out of the sheath! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard was shocked, but Kazmi did not. The pirate captain turned and shouted: "All rabbit scorpions, put down their arms! Surrender to the people in front!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all pirates and seamen stopped the battle in error . The pirate, the eighth in the open sea, held up his own samurai sword and swept them with sharp eyes. The pirates who were swept away were throwing their weapons, which declared the end of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the battles are over, Stewart will be slashed into the sheath and sent to Leonard in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From today, the Stewart private fleet does not exist. As long as the order of Lord Leonard, Kazmi; Stewarhaus I will go all out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the "quasi-angel" quietly sank into the sea. With the burning flame as the background, the eyes of the sea man and the sea man once again intersect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Leonard's response was extremely simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More words have no meaning. He did not accept the extravagant hopes of these people, but he misunderstood and achieved the respect of their leaders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have let us go, will there be no problem?" Kazmi asked. "If there is a problem, I will kill all those guys as your merits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to...it is too cruel." Leonard A glimpse - the man in front of him, when he wants to kill the men who have followed him for many years, he has no hesitation and scruples! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't want to be wrong. I don't have any bloody hands on these guys. If they don't die, you may be suspected by your superiors." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still no more." Leonard smiled. Although it will lead to the suspicion and suspicion of the first baron... but now he must use their power to defeat the enemy's plot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has almost no feelings for Sansen, but he wants to live. He doesn't want to die here, don't want to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Accurate...accurate..." He meditated and walked to Anne; Seifer was in the same position with a smile on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are the battle over, sir?" When he saw him coming, the blonde girl smiled and said. "The end is quite beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s almost over." The half-elf clenched the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I always feel that there is not a good premonition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leesa;Helmont Stop in front of the stairs leading to the captain's room and look in the direction of the "Dano". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She carefully looked around and determined that there was no ambush before she walked down the stairs. There were corpses all over the stairs. She was a little disgusted and speeded up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of Reza, the sturdy door of the captain’s room was slammed open. The black robe man flew out with the hatch and slammed heavily on the bulkhead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's you...!" The alchemist looked at the guy who was bombarded like garbage and was taken aback. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, meet again..." Machiavelli smiled hard and a trace of blood flowed out of his mouth. The shield that was surrounded by a shadow in front of him was now slowly disappearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Too ugly?" Resa clenched her golden scepter and evoked its stronger defensive ability. "Chain form!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not necessary at all...I am not your opponent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; With Machiavelli's self-deprecation, the loud noise of "Boom" echoed again in the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the golden chain guarded the front of the alchemist, a silver flash swept across the air, and the captain's cabin's bulkhead collapsed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white and shiny silver giant sword exudes dazzling brilliance, and makes the entire captain's cabin and the people inside clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man’s body was lined with silver-white long hair, and the man’s face was filled with a firm and full of positive expression, the trainee’s robe of the person’s body It looks extraordinarily dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man’s body is covered with a cloak of floating blades. The blade barrier, the powerful magic of both offensive and defensive, is much stronger than Machiavelli's Shadow Shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person behind him is shrouded in the light of the holy blessing. Divine power, which gives it strong combat and anti-magic protection, is one of the must-have magic of high-level combat priests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand of the man, easily clinging to the hilt of the great sword of both hands. The giant sword looked so heavy, but he easily manipulated it with just one hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left hand of the man, holding a thin "sacred covenant". On the cover of the "Sacred Covenant", the sacred emblem of the twelve Orthodox gods is drawn. The one pinched in his hand is Lesotho, the god of justice and judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...Nop?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lesa took a long while and only then I saw his identity on the priest's robe. This image is too much contrast with the cautious and crooked trainee pastor. She can't believe her eyes at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be said...the new bishop of the New World parish, Ionet; Hartman." Machiavelli gasped and corrected her call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you still insist on saying the same party?" Ionite pointed to Machiavelli with the tip of his sword, with contempt and pressure in his tone. . "I heard that you have a breakthrough discovery in mental control magic, why not come out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I tell you...the same party is already on the lower deck She is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Machiavelli’s voice is getting lower and lower, not to be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette slightly withdraws the tip of the sword and walks out of the hatch: "Speak clearly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "She is...obscurst!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Machiavelli smiled slyly, his right hand spread, and the entire corridor was shrouded in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well!" Ionite reacted immediately, inciting the giant sword in his hand and smashing to the place where the black robe was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;铿! The swordsman smashed the fog and swept to the chain where Reza was in a defensive state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female alchemist felt a strong blow through the chain, she could barely hold her own weapon, and took three steps to re-stable. The power of this sword is so amazing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionite retracted the weapon and replaced the magic command: "Transformation, war gun!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two-handed swords flashed silver, dispelling the fog; silver-white The slender gun appeared in his right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think that you can escape? true seeing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the shelters in a moment, whether magical or non-magical, are invisible in his eyes. When the black figure is there, the chief bishop does not hesitate to throw the right hand gun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gun accurately nailed the black figure to the wall at the end of the distant corridor, completely penetrating the shadow and penetrated the thick The wall of the ship is straight to the handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io came out of the fog, and looked closer recently, it turned out to be just a black robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief bishop shook his head in grief: "Still let him run away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also came out of the fog: "Nopp, you are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief bishop smiled warmly and restored Nopp’s expression: "Sorry, I have been holding you, I am the escort of this action. Ionite; Hartman, I can do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shah was shocked: "Ionite... Are you the archbishop of the New Orient Orthodox Church? Hartman, who is known as the genius theologian who has never seen a hundred years?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io nodded and pulled the gun easily out of the ship's wall and turned back to the dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the deformed silver weapon, Reza was taken aback again - she remembered a famous magic item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allies...Covenant Arbitrators? Orthodox Churches? Can you borrow me to study?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The chief bishop hurriedly refused: "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respectable Mr. Hartman... You see, I am also studying metamorphic weapons, but I have only studied two forms, let me study it..." Reza will only come up with this kind of "sweet" when she is especially interested in people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette hurriedly took the dagger into his arms and said: "There is no time now. We have to hurry down to the lower deck! He must still have Colleagues, otherwise it will never be delayed for so long!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lesa stunned: "Lower deck? Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the real Lord is there." "Nop" faintly walked toward the stairs. "I don't know who he said to be ‘her’...woman?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liesha, the ominous feeling once again came to mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows who the allure of the black robe man is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Kaikawi’s volume is really big!" When Leonard came over, Annie praised, "There are so many violent pirates "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where, I like it." Leonard answered absently. He held the hilt tightly and all his attention was on Annie's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In that case, you can actually do both sides without hurting... it’s amazing!" said the blonde girl with a smile. "The only man like this." In order to be worthy of Ms. Reesa."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she heard the name of Reza, Leonard’s heart was shocked. Can you really get started first? What should I do if I am wrong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is all over? Wait until you get ashore, let Bonnie do something good, how about we eat together? Let us create opportunities for you... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the sunny smile, he couldn't stab. He must confirm it, definitely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
