They first lost the rabbit, then the raccoon, then the wild boar, and finally an imperial prisoner. After these transmission tests were passed, the transfer mages of the Free Army headquarters personally transmitted it and announced to the person in charge that there would be a risk that the special envoy of Lenny would risk the transmission of magic to become ** amber within an hour. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement is a sign of the importance and determination of this special envoy. The senior responsible person of the newly established "Western General Army" is busy immediately. Lieutenant General Lopez put on his own general dress, and Colonel Luther, who did not have a big dress, wore his own political war costumes - the plain uniform of parliament. Of course, everyone knows that the deputy commander of the Western Army and the commander of the Lenny Army will soon have their own big dresses, maybe a major general, or even a lieutenant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not been so inspiring for a long time. In the few months since the outbreak of the war, the Freedom Army, which lost a large number of living forces in the Governor’s Incident, suffered the biggest failure in more than 80 years, losing one-fourth of the population and the speed of the first three free wars. Nearly one-third of the country, the imperial striker went straight to the city of Lenny. The Central Army and the Eastern Army, which had been highly anticipated, were repeatedly repelled by enemy forces that had double advantages in quantity and quality, and one important city and electoral area broke into rivals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the past week, the whole situation has undergone a radical change. On the battle line of more than three hundred kilometers, one of the empire's combat troops was swept away, and the two combat troops were repulsed, and the resulting gap was large enough to accommodate a country. In this miraculous battle, the South Fortress of the Fort Stilt is the most dazzling star. Compared with the defeat of the Central and Eastern Armed Forces, this army’s combat operations in the last three months can only be described as “outstanding”: to win Fort Still, to go south, to reverse the battle...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire parliament of the provinces is amazed at the combat effectiveness and mobility of this unit, not to mention that the officer of this unit is a politician who has just been converted to military service. - Although he does not seem to be a politician for a long time, it sounds like a person. In response, politicians and bureaucrats made some of the most insignificant changes at the fastest speed, the ones that best met the bureaucracy, such as changing the "Western Army" to the "Western Army." Adapted the "Stilburg Army Southern Detachment" into "Lenni Army". As long as you annihilate or defeat the empire's southern cluster, the glorious prospects are in sight. Many people have begun to secretly discuss the issue of the next presidential election after the victory of the war. More than one party is secretly sending the wave to the war hero. The Protestant churches also launched a large-scale religious activity, thanking the gods for blessing the grace of the free nations and the noble sentiments of the lord's courage. The desk of Colonel Luther’s desk has been inundated with praise from all sides. Almost every letter is headed by “Honorary General” or “Respectable Archbishop” to “Your loyal supporters and friends”. Or "Your devout believers and church members" to pay. History seems to have completely changed, moving in a better direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all of these reasons, Bonnie; Sefer and her friends are very happy now. She don't have her own badge on the chest and the three-level medal of freedom that was given to the liberation of Steelburg, decorated with a lace band with purple and red magical light, with her happy partners. The entire Western Army waited for the special envoy before the transmitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne, standing behind her, looked out at the pocket watch: "It’s been a ten-minute, a bit slow. How many people have to be sent for so long?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After all, it’s a transmission dignitary. If there is a lord here, they probably won’t choose this dangerous way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie replied that the line of sight did not move away from the gate where the anchor point was transmitted. In order to prevent interference, the 50 meters around the transport locator are empty, and no one is allowed to stay. All special envoys who travel by magic transfer are usually very streamlined, because too many people need a senior pastor to resurrect the unfortunate dignitaries who are mistakenly pushed into the wall, floor or ceiling. The shift rate of transmission magic in the mid-17th century is not a negligible value as in later generations. Most people are brave enough to lose their lives before using the transfer magic and locator to travel. The professional transfer wizard is also a high-risk occupation. Fortunately, this time everyone knows that there is a bishop at the scene, as long as it is not too unlucky and can be rescued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie was still complaining that the door was suddenly pushed open. The special envoy who came out seemed familiar, and Bonnie recognized him at a glance and greeted her face with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Chief Staff of the Central Army, Executive Secretary of the Staff Council, Hull; Colonel Tedwood, I am so happy to see you again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special envoy was indeed transferred to the Central Army’s Hull. Hearing this strange voice, he looked up and carefully looked at the greet in front of him, but he couldn't remember where he had seen the honorable member. "Sorry, may I ask if you are...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't remember? It's no wonder that we last met at a group reception. When I was just a banker, the chief staff officer probably couldn't remember me.” Bonnie lowered her voice. “Bai Sisi; Miss only often talks to me about you. She is very optimistic about your future in the Free Army. It’s true.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hur’s eyebrows rose, he would not forget the reception and the half-vampire agent. "You are the political spokesperson of that group?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it’s a military spokesperson now." Bonnie made a snap and gave a military ceremony, "I It is Pluto; Colonel Luther. Welcome to the Western Generals, special envoys."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her's astounding eyes flashed. He cleared his throat and solemnly said: "No, I am not a special envoy. Your envoy is behind me-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You young people may feel that I am old-fashioned, but I just can't believe these transmissions. But for this, I can endure this risk. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majestic gown and military rank flashed everyone's eyes, they immediately started the spirit, the sound of the heel collision sounded into a piece, only Hull The sound continues to sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"-This is the Joint Commission authorized Special Envoy, Chairman of the Freedom Army Staff Conference, Conti; Marshal Fox."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old marshal with a gray hair looks ready. He returned to the ceremony and shouted out the name of Luther. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, the hero of the Republic, Major General Luther."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing "The Major General" Bonnie blinked and suppressed her mood and hurried forward. Marshal Fox took out a pair of epaulets and a second-level freedom medal, and solemnly put it in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The staff meeting has agreed, this is what you deserve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie After the medal, once again honored a military ceremony. "Sorry, let the Marshal come at the risk of transmitting, it is our dereliction of duty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, the most responsible should be the self-management of the Central Army, After all, the road to Lenni was completely blocked by the enemy. Fortunately, due to the efforts of all of you, this situation will not last long." The marshal waved his hand. "Don’t waste time here, solve the war opportunity in one fell swoop." It is now! Take me to General Lopez, I want to listen directly to his report."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Clade; Lopez has long been in his staff The ministry is ready for the special envoy. On the map board behind him are two huge military maps, one is South Ruhrock and the other is South France. As soon as the door of the staff opened, both sides were a little surprised: Clad was surprised to see the boss in front of him, and Conti was surprised to see the map of Farius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to the Western Generals, Lord Marshal." Klad respected the military ceremony. "Your body looks healthier."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conti returned to the ceremony at random and walked quickly to the two maps. "You don't have to be a guest. Look at these two maps, you have already analyzed and planned, General Lopez. This time in Kegler's battle, what are the unexpected factors to report?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, let the parties report it." Lopez nodded and pointed to Nanimen and Annie. "You report to the Marshal, what happened in the air battle." ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie; Lieutenant Sefer, Intermediate Magic Certification, Lenny Army Logistics Staff."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fox turned and sat down at the table with a tone of appreciation The meaning: "These two are the heroes of the Emperor. Although the emperor has not been killed, it takes a lot of courage to dare to perform this task."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen and Annie looked at each other and finally Anne opened the mouth: "The problem is that, unlike what we expected, the emperor did not come to Kengal..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne described the matter once, but did not mention anything about Renee. In her description, it was only an emperor's substitute who came to Kengal. After saving the first princess who was being held by them, the man flew away and did not make further efforts in the battle in Kengal. After listening to the process, the Marshal Fox fingered the table and silenced for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean that the person is not an emperor at all? From the beginning to the end, the emperor did not step on the battlefield of Kengal?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kradd nodded. "Yes, that's why it can't be explained. In this battle, we all agree that Kengler is the key to the whole occupation, but the opponent does not seem to So think. They even brought 'power' and silver dragon, which proves that their plan from the beginning is 'let us think that the emperor came to Kengal'. If not our people fight hard, we may not even be able to do this. Found."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we can't win Kengler, the Stilburg Army and the Western Army can't be one, and the battle will be completely different now." Ningmen pointed to the map and said, "With the accumulation of materials from the emperors near Lenny, they are impossible to fight back. And by the number of troops in the northern line, they are unlikely to call. The importance of this place. We all know, but why did the emperor not know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nb Sp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is only one real problem. Where is the emperor, for what? There must be something more important than the victory of Kengal." The wrinkles of wisdom on the forehead of Fox’s forehead are huddled together. It trembles slightly, just as it is being calculated and thought. "Oriental front? Prepare to fight back? Desperate Lenny for a desperate attack? Yes, there are only two core issues, strength and logistics."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lopes stood up and walked Go to the map. "The possibility of the Eastern Front is relatively large, and the South France Muse can provide sufficient supplies. If he wins the entire South Fabians and the Figota public meeting, things will be very promising. But no matter where it is, it must be his use. To the scepter or the dragon. Do you want to inform General Betsy first?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Notify, he is now under great pressure. Don't forget Informed the Red Red Fleet Command of Intre. "The fox of Kengal has a smile in his smile. "When the emperor was in the south, the situation was better than we are now, but can they think of today? The bigger the pressure It may provoke a bigger reaction. The total collapse is always harder than we think, and negotiations are always simpler than we think."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1666 June 9, June mday+69 Orthodox Grand Duke Church, the first holy city of Taranto<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve acropolises are guarding the walls of the zodiac. Twelve cathedrals surround twelve spires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twelve-pointed star road turns around twelve statues pointing to the twelve-winged gate, and one hundred and forty-four twelve-sided pillars supporting the twelve-story Central shrine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a twelve-sided negotiating table at the top of the central shrine. The eyes of twenty-four gods are watching it at the same time. There are six sides on each side of the negotiation. The attendees, sitting opposite each other at the negotiating table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taranto is the first holy city of the orthodox church, and the great saints and the voters of the gods negotiated here through the first four public meetings. The final version of the Holy Covenant. It is not so much a sacred covenant as it is a massive negotiation - the negotiation established the principle of peaceful coexistence of human religions, preventing the eruption of an imminent religious war and laying the foundation for the rule of the only sacred empire. basis. In order to commemorate this sacred covenant, in the next thousand years, the kings, princes and generals of mankind always have to sign important treaties here, and even several armistice agreements for free wars are finally Signed by Taranto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this twelve-sided hall is the first time to negotiate between humans and elves. Jurisprudentially, the battle between the Elven Empire and its human slaves has never ended. But now, the two sides of the negotiations are the most powerful human beings in the world, and the most powerful elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign Secretary Ke Wei; Hugh; Earl of the Eagle Wing expressed welcoming to the other side on behalf of the Empire. Strictly speaking, this is the first time that the Earl of the Eagles performed the work corresponding to his title. The negotiations between the Kirman Empire and the southern rebellion are not diplomatic activities, but can only be counted as the internal affairs of the state; the negotiations with the colonies and the principalities are the same. In the eyes of the sacred empire, only the old elf empire, which is barely able to be considered equal, is now the Sassoon League. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To each other. I really didn't expect that I would have a day of negotiating with the Emperor Emperor in the first holy city of Tarantos. When I was less than 50 years old, I was fighting with your Rangers on the Eastern Front. I participated in three sieges of Sanitti Fegna in my youth. The retreat of the Twin Island was just like yesterday for me. Of course, These things may be history for you, not for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First citizen Teslo; Larry Mein (teslourlare hands Crossing in front of him, responding with a slightly arrogant voice. The other two families, Mandiel and Feria Deere, are sitting on his left and right hands, and then the periphery is the chairman of the three committees. Sassen has reason to be proud, although they have already fallen, but the empire that has maintained the millennium has its own pride. In the future history, Sansen seems to have been there forever.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop Ingrid sitting on the main side frowned and grabbed the first The people interrupted him before he spoke a more ugly history.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For us, those are not history, but the orthodox church and the gods believe that it is bigger." There is also a day when hatred can be resolved, and there is a solution that can be accepted by both sides in the cruel history. There are already enough blood in 1300 years, and we don’t have to let this blood continue.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy See is now overwhelmed, the prophecy of the previous victory seems to be defeated, and the entire orthodox church is forced to carry out crisis management work. The result of prophecy is indeed very encouraging, but The final result was unexpected. In order to restore the situation, the Cardinal Church and the Cabinet hit it off and organized the meeting in an emergency when the war was on the verge of collapse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "But we need to restore the glory of the past. Frankly speaking, I came here to risk opposition within the Senate. I believe that the obstacles encountered by the noble human emperor are only temporary, our strength is very limited, I am afraid Do not We can invest in unnecessary places. If the empire needs it, we are willing to contribute to the safety of the elves and half-elf expatriates in the southwestern empire, and we are willing to make due efforts for their autonomy. Of course, We also hope to discuss the issue of the autonomy of the elves and half-elves in the Soma Principality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of the first citizen is very clear. He knows that the empire is for What, he also knows what he doesn't want to sell. The elf's army will not go into hard work and can only play a role. Moreover, these lands will be loyal to Hongrinas after the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this condition, Ekko Sagan; Feng; Prime Minister Chalinburg finally could not sit still: "First citizen, I want the Soma Principality The autonomy with Sansen is their internal affairs, and the Emperor’s Majesty has no right to interfere.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teslow has no retreat: “For many years, The Dragon Knights of the Magongs have had many misunderstandings with us. We will not solve this problem, our glory..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough. Take away your glory." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gustav’s scepter, heavy on the edge of the twelve-sided table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first citizen, tell me what you want. The respectable Duke of Soma gave me full authority, what you want, and I can Accepting things, I think I can give you. I can't accept things, you will not have any results after talking. The situation is very urgent, we can give back a lot, but must be fast."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a great sense of pressure in his words, and the other eleven people stopped breathing for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spokesperson of the Mandiel family trembled and stood up: "No one has ever negotiated diplomatically. His performance is not like a big empire." The emperor..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teslow reached out and held him. "Forget it, this is fine. The Foreign Affairs Committee, handing over our draft to the Emperor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of agreement is actually faster than the process of mutual temptation. When the sun sets, the two sides of the negotiations have reached an agreement, and this consistency has been translated into a sounding and sounding text. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- It is no longer the time for our two sides to continue fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the name of His Majesty the Holy Emperor and the first citizen of Sancen, in order to create a solid foundation for the future of the civilized world, the government of DeLand and the government of Honglynast Willing to deepen the unity of their people while respecting each other’s history, culture and traditions.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-This is an alliance treaty based on immediate interests and Common enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The emperor gave up the jurisdictional requirements for the Dagonian territory and the Pioneer City (Flornasti) on the Soma River, and the Senate gave up on Sani The autonomy requirements of Tiegner and Northern Twin Island."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--The two sides each acknowledged the area occupied by the other side, and the empire ceded part of the aggression income for two hundred years. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The emperor gave up the sovereignty over the seven trading ports of New Coman, the New Zealand Intercontinental Island, and Muleiman, giving them the freedom to choose their own Representing and dispatching power to Hongrinasti. The Senate Senate allows imperial vessels to use all the elder overseas territorial ports equally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Colonial sovereignty, in exchange for overseas access rights and Shengsen each supported by the port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Imperial Fleet is free to exercise in the endless ocean, the Sanctuary fleet can travel freely on the land of the sea, neither side can interfere with each other's navigation. If there is a third party Interfering with the voyage of one side, the other ship will provide assistance unconditionally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--The two fleets have to join hands to have the opportunity to fight the great sea power of the republics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Coman Empire and the Sansen people will work together to weaken the military operations of the insurgents of the southern Koman, and Sassen will provide appropriate Replenishment, transportation, and military support. Any overseas territory or elf or semi-elf territory loyal to the southern rebel forces, if they are willing to give up their position, may recognize the sovereignty of the imperial emperor or send representatives to Hongrinasti to obtain autonomy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Who is not on the mainland, who is who to fight down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Senson provided eight million platinum platinum Denali (120 million gold marks) war loan to the Holy Empire, with empty crystal and white gold coins Provided, the actual receipt is not less than 86% of the nominal amount, 11% per annum, and the military expenses of the Sansen Navy are deducted from it. The Empire will be the autonomy of Saniti Fagna and North Twin Island. And the fiscal revenue of the next two decades as a collateral for this war loan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Sangsen provides a loan to buy imperial land, the empire with more The land is used as a mortgage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From now on, with the human sacred emperor Gustav; Hugh; Koman I and the first citizen of Sansen Tesla; Larimien In the name of Mr., the Taranto Peace Treaty came into effect.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first citizen and the emperor stood up at the same time and signed the name on the treaty in front of them. Cover your own coat of arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, the deal. I hope that our hatred that spans 1,300 years can be bridged. I hope the cooperation will be enjoyable."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor stood up and reached out. The opposite elf aristocrat hesitated and extended his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May our handshake be able to cross the next 1300 years." The first citizen, Teslow; Lerimien promised sincerely, "I didn't expect our glory to be returned in this way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have such a high hope, as long as this handshake can sustain your life. The end of it can be. If this is not enough, it will last until the end of my life." Gustav; Hugh; Coman's tone with a bit of sarcasm, "I don't want to say those hypocritical lines" ―I wish you a prosperous business, the first citizen.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teslo laughed and took a copy of his copy in Elvish. "I wish our business is booming, the Emperor's Majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gustav suppresses the feeling of his own heart and responds: "Yes."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
