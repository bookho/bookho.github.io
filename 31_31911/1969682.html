Central District 1<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***-***-***-***-***< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is over the central square of Lenny. Next to the sculpture on the side of the square, the soldiers in charge of the warnings opened the pots and bowls, used the meals, and sat on the tarpaulin in twos and threes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cocompany, will we continue to work on duty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander of this company Miss Spari tilted the soldier and said impatiently: "Of course, kid. You have not ordered the release of the police, we must ensure the safety of this area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seprior Spari is 42 years old this year, because he is bald, he looks like he is in his fifties. Everyone said that he doesn't look like a mercenary, but like a god or a scholastic thing; but in fact, he only writes the letters of his own name, and no one can write. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 20 years, Spari has been in the arms of the United States, the mercenary leader, can not rise, can not lose the army. It was not until two months ago that a new war broke out. He seized the opportunity to take a contract for training new recruits from the National Army at the price of 30 gold pounds, only to touch the side of the officers. Last week, the company's company commander was killed by a stray bullet in the battle for the city. He was officially promoted to take over the company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier turned and left, whispering a complaint: "But the captain did not appear in the afternoon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The second letter of Spari heard this and did not reprimand him, just waved his hand to let him rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second sorrow also had the same doubts, but as an old mercenary, he knew that he could not express his doubts about the sergeant in front of the soldiers. He looked around and quickly found an object to complain about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lieutenant Ganier, are you patrolling back? What is the situation outside, is there any new progress?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;His colleague, the young Frenchman Garnier, young and handsome, looks like the kind of youth that girls will pursue. As the third place in the federal sergeant school (scheduled), the second lieutenant of Garnier is only sixteen years old. He hasn't got a diploma yet, but at this time, he and his classmates are being recruited - the instructors who have assessed them are also on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ganelle looked at his peers and revealed a smile that was as perfect as a painting, bringing the situation together: "Returned, added The ordnance will be distributed immediately. The east side of the three walls faces a large offensive. The enemy forces may have hundreds of guns and tens of thousands of troops. General McKash has already transferred half of the reserve team to the second district. , ready to support."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a top student in the NCO school, Garnier is less than three magical strengths, and is one of the six intermediate magic officers of the division. Also serves as a company commander. The four companies have a total of three junior magic officers, and twenty-four magic warriors who can only use magical items. This number is less than one-third of the standard Freedom Army's establishment, and is now under his command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are we going to support? The troops stayed here for an afternoon and they are getting moldy." Sparly sneaked and said, "I said, God. It’s all black, and the kid with the chapter of excellence will not escape? He is a Lenny, and he may have escaped from the city.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will escape, maybe I fell asleep. I have heard some rumors about the captain. He is a very lucky person, no matter what the crisis can escape his life. So, in order to boost morale, he took him. It has become a hero of the Free Army. After all, it is a very embarrassing thing to kill a hero.” Lieutenant Garnier looked around and lowered his voice. “And he is the army of the Western Generals, the new Marshal’s army. The Marshal just took office. The headquarters is also taking time to make a flattering. Let's follow him, maybe there is still credit for it, or whisper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garnier shrugged: "At least we are still safe. As I see it, the East Three Walls will soon become a flesh mill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two The officers were bored and found a piece of tarpaulin and sat down. Another company set off to take over the patrol work of Garnier Lian; the company belonging to the third division has not yet returned. As you can see from the square, the crystal lamps in the big library were annihilated, and the librarians began to clear the scene. Groups of people are holding small books in small bags and rushing out of the door in groups - the one who is at the forefront of them is the "boy with a great chapter", Captain Soleton . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing this scene, Spari and Garnier stood up in surprise, loudly ordering, and let their company start the whole team. The door rushed down the high step step by step, and the two hurriedly greeted them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, Gagnell (Sparly) is on call!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistance The door counted the number of soldiers on the square: "Two companies? It should be enough to stop them. Lieutenant Garnier, you are a magic officer, right? Can you find General McCash?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gagnell respected the military ceremony and solemnly replied: "I just came back from the general. Outside the East Three Walls, the enemy is preparing for a big offensive. I don't think this is a reinforcement. Good time, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I have to go. The enemy chose the underground route, they want to break us directly from inside. Listen, I It’s hard to believe that it’s hard to believe.” Naimen paused. “I met the Gustav emperor who came to attack in the ground.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embarrassing Silence. The smile on the face of Garnier's face was not moving, and Spari whistled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Gustav emperor, hanging out like a groundhog, just happened to be touched by you, right." Spari asked again. "Then, have you ever come across the elves of the elves, the sergeant? It is said that their last emperor, Kleon II, became the undead emperor and has been swaying in the middle of the civilized world."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is biting, slightly raising the tone: "Pay attention to your attitude, less envious, I am not joking. I have ordered the entire library to begin to evacuate. The emperor has a whole knight. Mission, I need six company, no, maybe eight to ten company."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gagnel coughed: "Sir, your argument is difficult Convincing. Your performance today is like you have predicted the sneak attack of the Imperial Emperor. This is really suspicious, as if you are an insider of the Imperial Offensive Plan, your resume is not so strong. Of course, I personally believe in your innocence - if this is really a royalist The conspiracy of our forces, the loopholes will not be so obvious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door read the subtext behind the smile of the classmates: "You don't believe in the emperor Here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think this requires further investigation." Garnier looked at the sweat on the forehead of the door and said, "You escaped. If you are in such a hurry, it is very likely that you have made a mistake. If you don't object, I and Spani will want to lead the elite troops to resist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spari Attached to the road: "We took the soldiers to investigate and first vacated the library. The reinforcements, I am afraid you have to go to the generals. Oh, yes, there are two companies on the patrol."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End of the door? Soledon smiled a bit. Obviously, the two officers did not believe his words; the enthusiasm before running was also ruined. Indeed, this whole thing is quite unreasonable, and he can't say that what he is chasing is not the truth of the emperor. However, there are still some things he still has to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it. Garnier, Spari, you take the soldiers into the rare library in the depths of the big library, there is a just got rid of The secret road opened. The Imperial Emperor and his troops must invade from here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gagner asked: "We have three hundred people in the ground, underground The deployment can't be opened. When the sewers were cleaned half a month ago, the generals divided the trains into combat classes, which worked well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door shook his head: "No, don't distract, only elite soldiers with self-protection ability can monitor the tunnel. Once they start attacking, you will retreat. Don't force it! Don't! This enemy is the elite of the Northern Army. The elite in the middle, don't say a company, we can't beat them even if they are tied together. If you exchange fire with the enemy, you will save your strength and withdraw, and withdraw from the library."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I went to the general."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain Soledon said goodbye to the two temporary subordinates, took the horse to the square and left along the main road. . After Spari and Garnier watched him leave, he organized the troops to the library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole library is in a mess. Two young monks led the team to the underground library, and the busy librarians and trainee librarians were lifting magic and transferring books. The most striking nature is the black tunnel at the end of the corridor; it is obvious that Naimen relied on this tunnel to persuade the librarian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spari lit a torch and stooped into the tunnel: "There is really a tunnel, it’s just dug. Ah, this is 'excellence.' Zhang's footprint, going in, coming out. Is this the legendary tunnel that has a lot of noble gold?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gagnel holds the lighting stick with Behind him, I feel that something is wrong: "Is it true that he really saw Gustav? The rumor is that the emperor is a blind man, and he can really recognize it at a glance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't believe it anyway. Even we don't have a path to abandon the tunnel. Is there so many people in the emperor can fill it underground?" Spari turned sideways and knocked on the wall with his hand. . "However, this soil is not hard, it can be dug with a shovel. If it is really necessary to use the magical violence of construction work, we should do it. We should set up some traps here, and the ensign of Garnier."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gagnell nodded. "You are right. Let me come, your company will help the librarians to carry the rare books. There are also very good mages in the librarians. The clergyman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give it to me, the girl at the door said that there is a deputy curator on duty. How many mages they have, I have to spit it out. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spari confidently assured that he did. Soon, the various magicians and pastors in the librarians got a temporary National Army magic officer's armband, which was concentrated in the underground treasure house. The two lieutenants used these people to transfer the precious books one by one, and both of them secretly smashed two labor costs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the last treasure house was left, both Garnier and Spari felt the vibration of the work magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it really coming?" Garnier complained that the probe entered the tunnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a shimmer in the depths of the tunnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gleam gradually expands, becomes a light spot, and becomes a light spot. Unusual footsteps came from the soil, and the soil under the feet was shaking, just like a huge army was advancing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, someone blasted the first magic trap buried in the soil, and gravel and nails exploded in the narrow tunnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unexpected explosion caused a raging roar with a Figotta accent. There has always been a legend in the emperor: there were once deserters who were killed by the roar of the old military minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which bastard is moving forward without detection! Medical Knight support, fortification magic team to support the tunnel! Forward detachment, assault! Assault! Assault! Earl of the Eagle Wing, Call your judgment knight to stop your majesty, don't let him rush forward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign minister’s manly stopped the emperor, Gustav had to stop Come. He had a heavy stick on his hand with his scepter in his hand, hesitated for a moment, or did not order anything. He turned his head and complained to Jenny Car behind him: "The old man is still so arbitrarily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the "Mrs. Von Fegota" did not Respond to him. Reneka is not thinking now, just walking silently, surpassing the emperor. Her sluggish gaze ignored the judges who were blocking the judges, and listened to the killing sounds coming from there, stepping up the slopes step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will enter the very dangerous theater as you move forward, Ms. Feng Figota. Ms. Feng Figota?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cry of the Gustav emperor has no effect. The foreign minister, Ke Wei? Hugh? The Earl of the Eagle Wings, who was four steps behind him, could not stand any more. He had to whisper and reminded him: "Call the name, kneel down, call her name!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the girl stopped. Her eyes are still very sluggish, she seems to be thinking about something, and she seems to be thinking nothing. It seems that any mixed soldier can hurt her now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor frowned and turned to the Earl of the Eagle, and the scepter in his hand pointed to the top of his head: "Give your trial to the Knights for ten minutes. I know you." Brought a few high-ranking knights, and 'benevolent'. No need to pursue killing, priority to expel the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Understood, Your Majesty." Foreign Minister The command rushed up the slope and “will be resolved within five minutes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards stopped their steps and left a private space for the emperor. Gustav walked to the side of 黛nica and apologized: "I am sorry to call you anonymity, Miss Von Fegota."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛Nika did not answer. The emperor asked: "If you don't object, can I call you Ninica?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. I don't need that name." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I still call you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl faintly corrected: "Wei Lun "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Villen. Weilun." Gustav repeated the pronunciation of the name twice. "Good to listen. I remember, this is yours." Father name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mother name. I don't have a parent name, there will never be. No."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great emperor was taken back by her, and she had to turn her head and look down the slope. There was a slight chaos under the slope, and someone was busy throwing away a dispelling magic. He turned his head and looked at the top of the slope, and the Earl of Eagle had not returned yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gustav has to say something: "Let you attack the city of your hometown, it is still a very excessive thing. If you regret it, you can I don't do it. I promise not to hurt the city, and the general residents inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my own suggestion, Your Majesty. You don't have to worry. My thoughts.” Renee replied faintly. “Yes, this is my own advice, the path I chose. I have no complaints.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Gustav corrected: "But I can see the hidden sorrow in your eyes. You regret it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably, wait until everything is over After that, I will find out how much regret I have." Yanika listened to the shouting sound above, and the voice gradually went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You won't regret it. Lenny will be safe, there will be no massacre, no unnecessary killing. We have both played with the South Army." After more than a hundred years of shackles, I will not make the mistake of killing the city. Fortunately, Gresham is not there, or he will teach you." The emperor looked around in a reflexive manner and hurriedly said in a rare high language. "He will spend an hour analyzing why the massacre will seriously affect the logistics supply of the army and the financial situation of the empire. Almost every general has heard his long lectures, which will burn the castles of the Dukes from the south. The beginning of a huge financial crisis, ending with the stupid massacre of the distant Eastern Empire, proved that all the acts of the massacre were economically uneconomical, and it was the right thing for his tax officials to search. We all think he should The reason is simplified into one sentence: it is much easier to bury the gold than to dig the gold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 went up a few steps and deliberately turned his back Emperor: "I thank you for your promise. I only ... can't accept what I did. I am a very annoying person, sire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not. I am not going to open a solution." Gustav explained awkwardly, "Our Coman family has not been good at learning since ancient times, but your Figota family is very knowledgeable. I have an ancestor who said that if you want to be a real hero, then I must first learn to be a villain. He used this sentence as his excuse. Later he died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 went up the slope and looked at the front The scene, the expression stiffened, just replied reluctantly: "This joke is not very funny, sire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I did listen to the ministers privately, The joke I said is not very funny.” Gustav leaned on the slope and walked through the rare library that was empty and empty. “If you really have to regret it, try to think differently.吧..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really not easy to understand with your mouth... Keman’s family is really not very good at making sense.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 looks at the emperor complexly Back view: The scorpion is not very tall, but I don’t know why, but there is a feeling of inaccessibility. She bit her teeth and hurriedly chased the back and climbed up the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of dead librarians and Freedom Army soldiers are lying in the middle of the corridor, scattered among the gaps in the bookshelf, rushing to the trial knight We didn't clean up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor stopped before this piece of loneliness. A trial knight and a magical officer of the Guards were there, guarding the road ahead of the emperor. When the emperor appeared, the two raised their hands at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gustav raised his arm and gestured slightly. The trial knight again paid a courtesy and asked: "Your Majesty has already repelled the enemy in the museum. What should we do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The emperor ordered: "Let the eagle wing prepare the fire in every ordinary bookstore, and once we leave safely, it will burn the library."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this order, Jonica Verin took a deep breath and the bloody smell in the air reached her nostrils. She coughed fiercely, just like coughing up the lungs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This library also carries too many memories of her. She doesn't know how to stop it. She can only ask the first question that comes to mind: “Do you hate the library, squat?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I built three in DeLand, and also built in Golden Harbor, Dillamon and Palenha. Two. I like the library, the empire needs a library, but I can't allow an educational institution that is not controlled by the empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor’s statement is calm and confident Just like he has occupied the city. This answer is too official, and I don't even know how to continue to persuade. She silently followed the emperor and continued to look forward to the flash of the front, listening to the screams and screams from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, everything goes to silence. She went to the first floor and watched the emperor's order be executed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper level of the library has not been emptied, and ordinary books that are not rare are still stored there. Religious books, historical books, arcane books, and 黛nica smell the pungent smell of oil in the air, passing through one familiar shelf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book seems to have been borrowed, and her graffiti is on the shelf next to her. These topics can't be mentioned because she doesn't know how to mention it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the orders of the emperor, the remaining teams will burn the entire library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even these detachments responsible for burning the library are also composed of the military’s lords and honorary soldiers, each playing at least at the border. After five years of tug-of-war. This squadron beside the emperor is all the elite soldiers in the elite. The four great knights made their debut, and the veterans of the Guards, the Emperor, and the Noble Army formed the backbone. The Eighth Branch of the Masters Association and the Twelve Columns of the Orthodox Church also sent people as the pillars of magical power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gustav walked quickly through the hallway of the library, suddenly stopped at the end of the hall, looked up, and Renika almost hit his back. on. She looked at the emperor's gaze and found that he was looking at the elf-style painting on the ceiling. The emperor stared at the mural, indulged in, kept nodding, and the scepter in his hand gently patted the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This painting is probably a work of the Elven Empire... No, it should be re-drawn on the basis of famous artists of the fifteenth century. It’s beautiful, Wei Lun.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, Your Majesty.” Yanika looked up. She has also seen this painting, countless times. Every time she comes to the library with Solton, the teenager will watch the murals in this hall. Probably, he also watched it today? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor turned his head and shouted, "The court magi Riley Qing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Replace The middle-aged magician of Victor von Curick’s position did not know where to come out, stepped forward and approached the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged magician and painter looked at a mural and replied: "I think this is a very rare painting. The bottom painting is a fairy work, but it was not completed at that time. A famous artist completed it during the renaissance, which may be completed. Before and after the big rebellion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a way to save it? This building must be burned."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court magi Riley shook his head: "I can't, but Lord Hobbes should be able to. He has some experience in studying parallel planes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The court magi Hobssie!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time from the corridor is a man who seems to be more than seventy years old. He stood by the emperor and stretched out the mage's stick in his hand and stroked the ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the emperor and his royal magician discussed the issue of preserving murals, the Grand Duke of von Figeta had already rushed out of the main entrance with his striker knights. . Jenny looked at them in the direction, and looked at the emperor who was immersed in the art discussion. Suddenly, she felt that she was regretful and troubled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These nobles seem to be living in another world... obviously he ordered the burning of the library."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the way of thinking, Miss Weilun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gustav’s voice suddenly sounded in her ear, scared I have a big jump. I do not know when the emperor has stood behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You... can you get a glimpse of my thoughts?!" Renee asked reflexively. Immediately, she realized that the problem was rude and impolite, and hurriedly convinced her attitude. She took a small step back and gave a curtsy, "Sorry, Your Majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Sorry, I have no intention of concealing. This is part of the blood of the magical power of the Koman royal family." Gustav said that he could not hear any ups and downs. "It is me who ordered the burning of the library, but I want to save it." It is me who is rare and mural. I want to gradually weaken the past 100 years and let the new generation loyal to us grow up to bring peace to this land; I will also retain the past 100 years to enable the new generation to Know the beauty of the past. Everything that can be used must be used, and everything that is abandoned should be abandoned. If you want to make a decision, you have to make a decision, even if it is offensive. Love and affection will not affect my decision." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛nica suddenly understood what the emperor was doing. The emperor was trying to tell her how to get rid of her regrets and guilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I am an empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gustav Emperor stared at her eyes: "Abandoning and regretting this kind of feeling is the way the emperor thinks. It is another... it can also be your way of thinking, Wei Lun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but She is not an emperor. She thought about it and thought, but still felt that she could not do it: "Thank you very much, Your Majesty... But I think it is not so easy to cross the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will try my best to make you regret it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the emperor took a step outside the library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonyka chased it up. This time, she stepped over from the pool of blood on the ground. The tiny red footprints and the footprints of the large units are mixed and difficult to distinguish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showing in front of the imperial people is a wide central square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite is the Federal Museum, with the left hand being the Joint Parliament Building and the right hand leading to the Central Avenue. There are not many broad-leaved trees planted in the square. There are numerous sculptures dotted between them. There are also a number of stone chairs scattered under the sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one of the emperors has ever seen the scenery here. Gustav's ancestors almost visited the beautiful Duke of Lonnie, but none of them saw this square symbolizing freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the current emperor is not watching the square, he is looking at something that is more attractive to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the far distance of the central square, there is a firefly-like fire. There is one torch every three or four meters, and the blue and green rays of the illuminated crystal are interspersed between the torches, dispelling the night. The soldiers turned their backs to the museum and arranged them in neat formations. At the center of the entire line, the magical light shines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fastest judges in charge of the charge are reporting to their commander, Foreign Secretary Kewei Hugh? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The opposing commander is between the first and second companies on the left wing." The detective magician identifies the color of the protective magic and serves as the source of the magical light. Grand Medal. His tone changed: "The light... confirm that the enemy commander holds the 'Superior Medal!' This is a trap, sir!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eagle The Earl of the Wing pointed to the position of the shining magic light with the scabbard: "Does this person threaten a lot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loren von? Wrinkled and inserted: "Eagle Wing, you have not heard the name of the 'excellence chapter' in the rebel army? Is your territory not in the province of Dyram, never participated in the Battle of Steelburg? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My troops basically perform diplomatic missions throughout the empire, I am sorry, Duke Fegota."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Loren stunned him with a disdain and continued: "The 'Master of Excellence' is all one of the best fighters in the rebels. I saw more when I was young. There are a total of twelve regular divisions in the South Army. On average, each division can only be spread one or two. They appear on the battlefield with medals, and they can match a company. At the forefront, they drink a potent potion that is hardly controlled by any spiritual magic. If it is a leader of excellence, they prove that they have far more combat power than the general rebel forces, and have sufficient supply and tenacity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understood. So, the sneak attack failed, the enemy is ready, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The foreign minister is not asking the old duke. He pulled out the sword and pointed to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, we are not coming to attack. Judge knights and medical knights, armor! Sword!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical array and plaque on the armor are pressed one by one and shine. Dozens of swords are also sheathed at the same time, and the sound is as neat as a person pulling out a sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice also alarmed the commander of the opposing unit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tendoor? Soledon took a breath. He has already predicted that the enemy will be very powerful; but he has not expected the enemy to be so sophisticated and disciplined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his troops again, and the company of Garnier and Spari was still in front of the left wing. The struggle of the library was very large and lost more than he expected, but it was not yet acceptable. Have the opportunity, he thought, have a chance, after all, I also counted Sid? Naser, maybe still continue to count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gagnell! Spari! Go back and reorganize and be a reserve team! Hurry up from the gap!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gagnell’s company has been halved, and the calm smile on his face has long since disappeared. As he glared at the soldiers, he squeezed through the gaps in the array: "I apologize for suspicion of you before, sir. I feel glorified for being able to fight with you, sir. That luck is also part of strength, sir. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Spani’s company was on the side of Garnier, his company had two-thirds of the soldiers, but it was still orderly. "Shangyu, I really didn't think it was really an emperor! This is exactly what a great chapter should do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Working hard, you have already won Time. I think, the Ancestral Congress thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, time seems not enough. Naimen Soledon looked in the right hand and looked at the joint parliament building of the free nations. The building has no soldiers to defend, and the company that guarded it is wiping their new guns behind the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the parliament building, but within the entire first district, the Freedom Army has no soldiers, and all the troops are by his side. He only pulled six company companies, and the rest of the troops went to the East Third District to prepare for the night attack of the emperor - no, from the scale point of view, it should be called the night general attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lips of the door trembled slightly, carrying the width data of the central square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly noticed that the entire square was so quiet. There have been no civilians in the square, only the two armies facing each other. The door was suddenly striding out, and the right hand was shot, and a gem containing the commanding sound reinforcement was turned into a powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the winner of the 'Certificate of Excellence', Naimen Soledon, the class is the captain, served under the command of Clade Lopez, the position is The Chief of Staff of the Lenni Army Staff of the Western Army. I was ordered to stop your army from moving forward at all costs. I hope that I will be fortunate enough to know the name of the respectable knight opposite me to demonstrate the glory of this battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be said so. Nanimen looked at the opposite camp and saw a young knight and an old general in the array of emperors whispering. After a while, the young knight spoke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am the Minister responsible for Imperial Foreign Affairs, the Earl of the Eagle Wings of Dillamon Province, directly loyal to Gustav Hugh Coleman, In the great trial of the Knights as a law enforcement knight, received a sword named 'passion'. Can fight with a 'class of excellence', I foresee that this will be a glorious battle. May our courage I can be blessed by the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door nodded and turned and walked to his array. He secretly said in his heart, "These aristocrats who have never eaten"... Even in this era of muskets and magic, they still follow the aristocratic etiquette of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it doesn't matter. The time he needed has already been won. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was turned back and looked at the top of the tall stairs. He decisively reached the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are all right-wingers, aiming at the enemy's frontier! Four, three, two, one, set fire, volley!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first round of the free-agent test began, and only the soldiers on the right wing equipped with the new enchanted rifle pulled the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trigger linkage gear, the gear hits the meteorite, the meteorite ignites the gunpowder, the gunpowder pushes the air, the air flows through the rune in the raft, pushing the bullet to rotate forward, flying over The whole square! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bullet hit the shoulder of the eagle wing. The gold-forged nails on the nails swayed the spiral aperture, but they could not stop the bullet. He felt a sharp pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights in front of several positions around him have a heavy armor, but they have been collocated by this round of volley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than a hundred years, finally blood has fallen on the square symbolizing freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Military Affairs collapsed with a degree of agility that was incompatible with his age, shouting, "In addition to the commando team, the full array of defense!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain caused the count to be angry, and the other party did not give them time to prepare for the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Judgement Knight, Packed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl's roar and hoarseness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dense gunfire, you can hear the sound of the imperial knights calling the horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From nothingness, there have been black horses from different worlds, these horses docilely squatting at the feet of the trial knights. This is their magical ability and the reason why the emperor chose them as key members of the assault force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor needed a cavalry capable of passing through an underground tunnel - of course, the cavalry did not exist; but he could have a cavalry capable of summoning warhorses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire cavalry leaped down from the high steps and rushed forward. The medical knights embarked on healing magic, holding a big sword in their hands and following them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the library was ignited. The flame illuminates the back of the emperor, and it also reflects the eyes of the Freedom Army soldiers. They stared blankly at the fire and watched the treasures of knowledge that were available to all citizens to burn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The left-wing volleys!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
