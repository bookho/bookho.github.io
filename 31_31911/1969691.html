She realized that even she herself had inadvertently underestimated the inconspicuous young man in front of her - she knew the history of the future! She knows what kind of person he will be! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achievement is usually the sum of ability and luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, if you are lucky, becoming a ruler of a country is not difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gods who are favored by the current ruler, a successful mid-level officer, a young and glamorous alien reformer, a royal family Heirs...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are too many ways to become a ruler of a country, most of which have no requirements for personal abilities, only requirements for luck. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, becoming a long-term ruler recognized by a big country is another very different thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the history that Anne knows, Nami Soleton will receive the royal surname and, in the late period of this century, become the magnificent era. Prime Minister of the Holy Coman Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will use nearly a hundred years to establish "peace under Koman" and use another hundred years to prove that this peace is valuable . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All other people in this position will be referred to as "current prime minister", "previous prime minister", or by adding "the prime minister" after their name The suffix; but to call Nami? Hugh Coleman, people only need to call him "Imperial Prime Minister" or even "Prime Minister" is enough. Twenty years after he died, people used the prime minister to call him, including young people born in the post-war peace years. Every imperial person, and even many foreigners, believe that the undead prime minister will eventually return from somewhere and regain control of the world's hegemony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can anyone say the endurance? Hugh? Coleman’s two hundred years of governance is a dictatorship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the root of this position shows, the goal is to be the emperor’s hand, only for the peace and interests of the empire and even the world. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t seem to be in love with the stack, he has been resigning more than 20 times in the empire’s political arena; he looks very approachable, anyone can Going to the door to refute him, even if it is just an ordinary imperial subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the history of the future will be recorded as such: no one can make other choices whenever the Empire really needs to summon its prime minister. Even his political opponents must marvel at his gorgeous and bright strategy - this is not even a conspiracy, because everyone can clearly see the reasons, choices and decisions of the Prime Minister and admire the politics that are not afraid of all pressure. art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the two points of adapting to the situation and adapting to the situation, if the Prime Minister says that he is not good at it, no one in the world dares to say that he is better at it. He is so good at transforming the situation that all his enemies agree in the same way that the Holy Coman Empire cannot be beaten as long as he is there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under his rule, the empire can expropriate and absorb everything it can find, men, women, the elderly, children, dead, living, to maintain the empire s future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister never played tricks, he just observed, analyzed, and then made a response, pulling the sword to break all the chaos. It is a famous sword hidden deep in the sacred scabbard. The appearance is blunt and simple, and the blade is sharp like a blast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I should know. I should know that he will find this. For the average person, it is an incredible conjecture; but for him, this is the deepest after leaving all other possibilities. Suspicion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a long silence, Anne finally decided the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she replied cheerfully: "You found out. I don't have to ask the reason, and then hide it, it doesn't make any sense."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know why, after making this decision, she felt a little relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am indeed the magician of the future, using magic that has not been completed in this era."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Her answer is so refreshing and clear, so that the door that was still pondering how to further question does not know how to get down. All the lines he prepared seemed to be useless, and only "hmm" said two words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie raised her right hand and calculated: "As for time, one hundred, two hundred... if it is not a fraction, two hundred and thirty years."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a sense, that’s a really amazing number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two hundred and thirty years. What kind of future is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soledon got up straight, took a step to the side, and sat down on the edge of the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hundred and thirty years. What is this concept? His current life can be repeated for thirteen times and there are fractions. The average person can pass on his family business to the hands of Zeng Zeng once had great-grandchildren. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling two hundred and thirty years, that is, the fifteenth century, Lenny is also the territory of the Coman Empire, and there is not even any republic in the world. There is no even a musket. The noble knights riding their high horses and their magician advisors shuttled between the towering castles to discuss the greatness of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that he was asking the question, Anne replied: "My time is hard to describe in a language you can understand, because many words have not been in this age. Appear, just like if you go back to the 15th century, it is difficult to explain to people what is 'stock company', 'military staff' and 'artillery'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two hundred and thirty years." The door was repeated again, and the voice was still very low. "Then you didn't actually complete the magic of crossing the time, Anne?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Anny nodded. "Yes. Even after two hundred and thirty years, we have not completed the magic that can stabilize the passage of time and space. How did you judge it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is a bitter smile: "It’s too long for two hundred and thirty years. If it were me, I would probably choose a more recent age than a distant 1400. Two centuries I didn’t know anyone before. It’s an accident in a magic experiment, right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was an accident, but it was not an accident. At least, this time was still my choice." Annie smiled. "I am not alone in this era."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door with a slightly ridiculous tone, corrected the mistake in his previous sentence: "If it is a generalized 'cognition', I also know '1400' Some big people.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne shook her head: “It’s not this 'knowing’. The person I know has lived to my age.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After living for two centuries? God, how much material and magic do you need!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistance The door counted the theoretical values ​​and came up with an unbearable astronomical number. Replacing the body and continuing youth are the magic that gradually accumulates. Only the top-level spells of the most determined will be able to complete these magics, not to mention that each body accumulates a variety of diseases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That must be a great big man. The average nine-segment mage can live to the age of ten and already feels guilty... or that your age already has Great progress?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residents listened to Anne's remarks and looked at her calm and calm expression, almost fascinated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He searches for his own memories and determines that he has never seen Anne’s expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onday, Anne always wears a variety of smiles and works hard on various occasions to stir up the atmosphere. The smirk that was accidentally made in order to get rid of the mistakes, the laughter caused by the snoring in the serious dialogue, the use of magic in the center of the battlefield, the corner of the mouth slightly raised with a mad smile, frowning when angry Laughter... Even when she is expressionless, it looks like she is waiting for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door suddenly understood what this expression is attracting him-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This expression is Anne Safir's "sadness." She is a person who will deliberately avoid grief in front of others, so he can't recognize this expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this sadness is really obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did so much for the army of the door and the free country, and even paid the life of being the strongest magician of the world, but failed to fulfill her wish. . This war has hindered her pursuit, and she may no longer be able to fulfill her wish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just one moment, Nintendo came up with a lot of words of comfort, but felt that no matter what sentence is not suitable for speaking. No sentence can be seen in this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Namimen sighed and moved in the direction of Annie, holding her right hand quietly. Annie glanced at the right hand in a conditioned reflex, but immediately calmed down, defaulting to his movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If appropriate, tell me who you want to find and what you want him to do. No matter what you want to change history, I will always Standing on your side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny gently shook her head and laughed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need. It is no longer necessary. I have found my goal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp I don't know why, Nana thinks this smile is still a "sad smile." He felt that this was just a lie she had said to comfort him, but he did not have the courage to expose her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can understand. If there is no such war, then he will think." He thought about it and said, "If you are looking for someone, I will be fine." ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing this sentence, the expression on Annie’s face gradually changed from “sad smile” to “unstable low laugh”. Annie seemed to be trying to hold back her laughter and use his right hand to point his hand in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the sentence." Annie held back and said, "Yes, that person is you."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the door was silenced for a while, he laughed twice: "This should not be a joke for an active atmosphere, Anne?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Of course not.” Anne turned back to the serious expression and said in a word, “You are the big man, the door to the door? Soledon.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sentence doesn't sound very practical, but Anne's additions make it sound a lot more realistic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can tell you the history I know, but I don't know what happens after you know your future. I have made a choice, but you You should also have your own choice. Do you really want to know your future, and you are resistant to the door?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence doesn't sound like a joke anyway. At least, it doesn't sound like the three-legged cats who play the crystal ball on the roadside predict the magician's tricks. There is a lot of resistance to the door - knowing the future, even if you only know a part, it is definitely a powerful force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The future. I only have one question. Is the future a sure fate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You really thought about this problem." Anne's answer is very clear, "Of course not!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie shook her head and corrected: "This is not necessarily true. The fate does not exist, but 'destiny' exists. I personally call it 'history elasticity.' The historical preconditions and inertia do not change. It will tenaciously bounce the power you impose on it in unexpected places. Until now, I am not sure if history will be tenaciously returning to the future track I know. I can only determine one point: fate It doesn't exist. The human will can change the world to a certain extent. Knowing your future is not necessarily a good thing, it will affect your choice, and may even put you under control. Even so, you want Do you know the future?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door immediately understood what the risks Anne said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, as Anne said, he had the opportunity to be a big man, all his future actions would be tempted by this goal. However, because fate does not exist, he is likely to eventually fail - the pain he experienced at that time will be much stronger than if he did not know the future. Many people will regret the choices made in life - if someone comes back from the future, tell him "you could have made a better choice because it is like this in the history I know", this pain It will definitely be ten times and a hundred times larger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is the end of the day before, it may refuse to bear this pain. He did not seriously consider that he would become a great magician. This idea is just as unrealistic as an ordinary person in the industrial age seriously considering himself to be a tycoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the door will not reject this opportunity. He needs strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also needs strength no matter what the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, I want to know. I want to know what kind of person I will be in the future in your history."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne's mouth is picking up, revealing a relaxed smile - just as she knows he will choose. It’s like she has been waiting for this moment for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I bet you can't guess what kind of big person you will be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resist the door and shook his head in disbelief: "The great magician of two hundred years old, even if it becomes the hegemon of the world, there is nothing strange about it. What more exotic future do you have?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"History is always more bizarre than the story."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie confidently said the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will get the emperor's surname and become the prime minister of the empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lived, stuttered and confirmed: "Imperial? Are you talking about the 'Holy Coman Empire', Anne? Or other empire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anne's eyes became ethereal, and she turned to the infinite distance and cast her future in her memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the 'empire', and you will be called Naomi? Hugh Coleman. That is probably about twenty years later... ... less than forty-year-old Naomi? Hugh Coleman became the Prime Minister of the Empire in 1688. That year he directed the royal and Far East coalition forces, regained DeLand from the aristocratic army, and reunified the split empire... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please wait, is the Queen a Queen?" Nanimen couldn’t help but wonder, and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. Gustav has no daughter - even if there is, his daughter will not be able to crown him twenty years later." Annie strangely married him. At a glance, "What is the problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...No. Please continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Resist the door and thought about it, decided not to associate this piece of memory with his own Hughmanman surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne returned to her own memories, using the sounds of the whispers of the ear, telling the old memories recorded in the history books. Her statements skipped the dazzling military and political actions in the middle, directly showing the cause and all the results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The new empire you are about to build is destined to be the greatest achievement of this era, and it will create glory for at least two hundred years. There is no universal education in this era, no Social security is what the empire created. No one has ever promised that the country that claims to be the Republic will be better than the country that claims to be an empire. The elected bureaucracy will be better than the emperor's servants. The tycoons and politicians will be better than the officials and loyal ministers... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She talked about the empire's stalemate in this war, the failure, the debt and the ensuing crisis of governance, the rebellion of the nobility, the death of Gustav and his heiress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said that the Queen appointed a man who led some Eastern mercenaries to be her prime minister, speaking about the war, domination and fear he brought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She talked about the signing of the Empire Charter and the re-credit of the Queen’s blood in DeLand, about the colonial war and the opening of the global business road, and talked about the Eastern route. The company's splendor and bubble talked about the establishment of the Extreme East Crisis and the Great Wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She talked about the signing of the "Fergota-New Comania Peace Treaty", talked about the long industrialization and the peace of Koman, and talked about the republics and colonies. Revolution and independence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She talked about the proliferation of education and the number of magic users, and talked about the economic depression and the reversal of diplomacy until the end of the gilded era of the mainland war... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, time has passed for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, she and he were lying on the same bed, looking at the ceiling together, his left hand and her right hand tightly held together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of this story, the Liberty Bell rang three times before and after, and Lenny’s ground shook two times. It’s estimated that some Masters are like him. Study how to use spells in a magic net environment. The roof of his broken bungalow was also cracked by some cracks, and two or three small holes penetrated through the cracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat next to her, holding her right hand, listening to the future story while waiting to cope with various accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this will not affect the progress of this long story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Three years after the death of the Prime Minister, the DeLand military government surrendered. Koman re-divided into an independent country without threats, and its capital became the world. The only neutral free city, that is my hometown. This is the end of the 'Time of the Prime Minister'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny is silent, licking her lips, and resisting the door Busy handing the cup to her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After drinking the water, the blonde girl sighed long, closed her eyes, and stopped talking for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was put back on the table, and a water refill was used to refill the cup: "Is this over? I thought you would talk about it." How do you know me and you in the future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this question, Annie suddenly pulled his hand out of his palm and supported the bed. Deliberately put the face to the inside of the bed, avoiding the eyes of the door. She held her breath and did not want to let the door see the shyness on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No... Actually this is not the end. My history is over here, and your future is not yet."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said with her eyes closed, the tone sounded very low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then, I returned to this era and revamped your destiny. You should have gone to the empire. The Queen will not appoint a stranger to do it. His prime minister, the nobility will not surrender in front of the stranger's flag, and the empire will not accept the charter drafted by an outside adventurer..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie I endured my emotions and said the apology. When she said these words, she kept her eyes closed and did not dare to look at his expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I changed all of this. Sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This apology is already in Anne’s heart It has been around for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She already knows that he is the same person as him. She already knows that fate can be changed. She also doesn't care how much power she puts in to fight against her fate - but she still feels that she may have erased the future of "Nenmen? Hugh Coleman." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about that?" Nanimen grabbed her hand again. "I don't see anything worth apology for."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reason why I fight for my country is because the past experience made me decide. If I will become the prime minister in the future, it will be because the future situation will make me make that decision. This is not because Anne changed your destiny. But because this is my choice. The fate does not exist, it is not Anne's responsibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She struggled twice, but this time The strength of the door is much higher, and her wrist is tightly held. This level of grip is not enough to hurt her, but it is enough to ensure that she can't struggle with her own arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can't find the way, you can go to the empire. There, you have the chance to become the prime minister of the empire, and the actual rule of the entire civilized world." Annie.” Annie had to emphasize it again. “Perhaps you don’t understand it now, but I have to tell you this way! This is my responsibility. I don’t want to destroy your future.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, I will remember. Just, I care more about another question..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smiled and raised a completely unrelated question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, you just said that Deland is your hometown. That is to say, you are an imperial person in the future. Why do you choose to come to our south? Country, and against your future motherland? Why do you want to change this fate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie stunned. This question was the first time she heard it, and she thought of it for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did she return to this era to change the fate of "Tendoor? Hugh Coleman"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has had many reasons. She wants to find the man who disappeared. She wants to know his young age. She wants to test his abilities and courage. She wants to protect him in this crisis-ridden battlefield. She wants to work with him to create memories that belong to both. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Anne was the first to hear this question, she suddenly realized that all the answers were already lying in the softest part of her heart. ―<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have been waiting there for a long time, just waiting for the opportunity to be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You may think that I am coming back to fight against Coman and its rulers... No. I love my country, I also Also love its prime minister. The Holy Coman Empire brings progress, security, peace, knowledge and technology to the world. Even his enemies cannot deny his contribution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne quietly avoided the slight difference in the meaning of the two loves in a side-by-side relationship, but the door listened to subtle differences in tone. He smiled in a complicated mood and swallowed his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the Holy Coman Empire finally failed. While creating glory and brilliance, the huge organization machine gradually rusted and aging. It is powerful It was so powerful that it continued its war for three years after its control and designer died; but it failed, along with all its citizens. I later discovered that this is inevitable."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inevitable? Why?" Nymen asked curiously, "because it is an evil dictatorship?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "No. The Holy Coman Empire has a charter, an election, a bureaucratic system, an imperial lawmaker, an executive judge, and a guardian knight who preside over justice. The design of this organization is also very good, and it is 'reward and punishment'. Promote outstanding members and punish poorly performing members. It used to be a progressive machine full of efficiency."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who was?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any organization faces a paradox. Every organization needs For members, those who excel will be promoted – until they are promoted to positions where they can no longer perform well. As long as the organization is running long enough, this will result in an inevitable tragedy.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of thinking, I thought of the conclusion: "As long as the time is long enough, all positions will be occupied by mediocre and even incompetent people."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This huge machine can hardly change. It can only find ways to change the organizational structure and selection criteria to suit different situations. Unfortunately, regardless of the selection criteria. Still loyal, whether it is ** or cruel, the result is the same. If you use ** as the standard, the organization will eventually be filled with people who are not greedy and greedy; if you use cruel as the standard, it will eventually be full of People who can't do it with brutal repression."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No matter how much resources and ingenuity you use to fill in, you can't save an organization that has begun to devour everything. The new mechanisms built to solve problems will soon become new problems. One day, everyone I feel that I am full of mistakes, but I can't correct it, I don't even know how to correct it. That is my motherland, the sacred Coman Empire in the late 19th century. That is you, the country that Naimen Soledon will build. Even though The best caster in the world, the world's best scientist, the world's most powerful war machine, can't change its destiny. In our time, that fate is called the mainland war. Everything is corrected and even overcorrected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie, in turn, held the hand of the door. Even if it was just a memory, these memories were enough to make her tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the fate I want to change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde girl’s voice is dull, but Full of suppressed passion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What I want to change is that it uses all the price to burn human wisdom, courage and life to maintain a glamorous appearance and hypocritical peace." It engulfs the nation's nationals, the brightest brain and the most heroic soul. It engulfs everything in the future, and the people who love you and the people you love."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact... even our republics began to feel rust and decay." Naomi whispered, "But, is there really a way? We can really change Is this inevitable fate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The historians of later generations will always say that it is the wheel of destiny, that is, a page that has been turned over in history books. These things can't be changed. However, the mathematicians of our time have shown that in a chaotic system, as long as the starting conditions are gently changed, it will cause a huge final difference. In other words... Science has proved that The fate does not exist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Close your eyes and Ni, most insipid voice to tell their own answers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only know that I am the most powerful magician in the world. I only know that I am going back to the past, not to re-establish a time in this era. The Holy Coman Empire. I only know that I can meet you here, it is already a miracle that is almost impossible to achieve. If you can build a monster of the Holy Coman Empire alone...wewee two Can do better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When listening to this passage, Naimen Soledon felt very small. Although the words of this paragraph are only one arm and torso, the girl lying on his bed like a broken doll, he feels that he is not worthy of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods. This is the real top magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, what do you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The specific method, I don't know But I believe there is a way, there must be. If you admit that something can't be solved in your own heart, then it really can't be solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Anne slowly turned and looked straight into the eyes of the door. Her aquamarine-like eyes are burning at the moment, making a breathtaking and unspeakable charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power we have is not unintentional. The spiritual weapons that scholars have been developing for thousands of years will not be meaningless." It is the tool we use to change the certain destiny! It is the weapon we use to crush the desperate chain! If the node is festering, then replace the node! If the organization is decaying, destroy the organization! If the system is invalid, then change the system. Because, because -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These sentences are too long, and Anne said that she was a little breathless. The door can feel that her virtual internal organs seem to be screaming. He gently stroked the cold waist of her tentacle and listened to the calm voice to tell her will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because our belief is power! If reality and ideals don't match, then we will change the reality!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The will is so firm, so unshakable, not at all like a word that knows who will go to death. Not at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because we are magic users, because we can change the reality, these are, and can only be our responsibility. We will create a better than you Everything that knows, even better than anything I know--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie repeated this tense, I don’t know where the blood came from into every capillaries on her face, cheeks Dramatically became red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She panicked her only arm and tried to turn her back, but she resisted her and prevented her from getting out of her sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie was more anxious, she used a broken arm on the bed board in front of her, and turned her back to the door. She didn't want him to see his expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hold, sorry, just this paragraph is... yes... yes, it is an excerpt from the novel I want to create. It’s good after the previous novel. Now, I think there is always something to plug in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny awkwardly argues, just like not realizing that this action means she sent herself The same in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelvin is aware of it. His left hand is still clutching her right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His left arm was forced by her previous action, pressed underneath, and even touched Anne’s perfect double peak. He can feel her body temperature and can feel her heartbeat, not just the cold glass and magic flow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door does not know that he will be named "the commander who will capture the fighters" in the future, but he can still feel his right hand is eager to move. Is trying to capture valuable fighters. Another instinct tells him that this is a trap. This is a dangerous trap. There are some presuppositions in Anne's words that he didn't know. This is a dispute between the left and right brains - or the upper and lower body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young officer repeatedly meditated in his heart, "This is the danger of swearing, it is not right," but another voice repeated in his ear. Maybe there will be no better chance than this. Now attacking all the defenses can fall apart." His right hand rises and falls next to the trousers of the military pants, and the two thoughts are in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the end of the door just squeezed out: "Annie, I understand. I know this is your real thought."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two are silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the right hand of the door finally lifted from the trousers, but still hanging in the air, never before going forward. That short distance is full of thousands of weights, and it is as heavy as history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't dislike her. He is not a gentleman who does not want to take advantage of it. Of course, he is not the one who puts "the fight is a man's thing" or "I don't want to fight with a woman" and sees a woman who is stronger than herself but finds reasons to avoid it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, that heavy feeling is lingering. Until now, he did not fully believe Anne's story, but he could not find a reason to doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen knows that she can get her as long as she reaches out, but he also knows that it means that he will pick up all the gifts and curses of Annie. What is even more frightening is that he knows that if he promises, he will definitely do it. Even that responsibility would devour his poor little ability, even his entire life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He likes her, no doubt. However, does he really love her to the point where she can assume this responsibility? he does not know. The distance between the two is too subtle, he can't distinguish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, he can lie and comfort her, after all, this may be her last day...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp But that is a door to resistance? Sorelton will never do anything. Naomi is good at work, but he also knows clearly that as a magician, there are some beliefs that he will definitely stick to the end. Probably, the "Ten? Hugh Coleman" in her story will make the same choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence continues. Lennie's magic net is still shaking, and the exploratory magic of one after another hits the magic net, causing another echo. The free bell rang and the ground shook, but the air in the room still seemed dead, and he and she could only feel the breathing and pulse of each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, still Anne broke the silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door can hear the nasal sound in her voice. The nasal sound was well hidden, but he could still hear it. He noticed that she once again quietly changed the name of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And by then, they will be able to master the rules of the Lenny Magic. There are already many people doing this. So, before that You must go to the parliament to master the Lenny Army, at least the best part of the Lenny Army. If you need, I can give you some names."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Anne Sefer is doing his part in fulfilling his role as a future person. The door-to-door vision moved from her broken thigh to the back and waist, from the waist to the neck, and stayed on the pearly skin, watching the repressed trembling. He can feel that the repressed feelings are being conveyed through the magic net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand of the door was unconsciously moved forward again, and then stopped again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like the nerves of the upper arm are no longer listening to him. This short few minutes feels longer than the entire Battle of Fort Sill and the Battle of Jena. If there is an enemy attacking, the confidence of the door can make a quick and decisive response; but now there is no enemy attacking...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just when he is about to start praying "Give me a pressure to make choices," the floor of the room really started to vibrate again. This time the vibration is bigger than before, it must be fierce, and the door can even see those magic nets that originally existed in the light blue etheric line melt into the background color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie pulled her nose hard and said in an incredible tone: "How could it be so fast? Has anyone mastered the use of the magic net? Even if the basic principle is In the same way, the principle was tested without any reference material, which is too exaggerated... Newton is not in Lenny, is Iona mixed? It will not be Huygens or Locke..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as she talked to herself, the house shook even more, just as the epicenter was near them. The dust on the beams fell, and even the cups on the table began to slide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, Nana suddenly realized what Anne said as "the elasticity of history." It always happens in unexpected places - like now. This invisible "elasticity" is forcing him to make a choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps everything she said is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or hug her, or let go, there is no third way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Think carefully, this is not a choice at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside all his concerns and worries, he did not hesitate to reach out his right hand and crossed Annie's thin, light torso and hugged her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unprepared girl struggled in panic before this unexpected violent hug, slamming the arm of the door with the only hand: "Wait, wait. How come suddenly..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessing the door does not mean anything to let go. He has made a choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hope you have is my hope. The future you want is my future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up her, lifted her body off the bed, squatted in her arms, and continued to whisper in her ears about her commitment and responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We will go to the parliament building together and go to see Marshal Fox. We will find a capable pastor and we will find a way to treat your body. As you said, we can't admit that one thing can't be solved - otherwise it can't really be solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait, wait..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing these words, Annie shook her face and shook her head, seemingly deny something. Her hair was slightly licking on the cheeks and chin of the door, and itchy. But he decided to ignore these signals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will accompany you to the end of the story, no, even if it is the end of everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The door was tightly held by Annie and stood up from the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
