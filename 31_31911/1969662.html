The neat retreat of the other party made the Central Army hesitant, while the Western General Army was dragged by the enemy remnants of the Kengal region. In the next few days, the two Freedom Forces in the North and the South filled the gap left by the Emperor. All the avenues were unimpeded, and the troops marched at the speed of the Freedom Army, but they still could not catch up with even the other guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be honest, I am surprised that the first unit you encountered is actually a friendly army. Which unit of the Central Army?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pluto; Major General Luther left the queue that was moving forward and caught up with the team of combat staff. The queue of the Lenni army continued to move forward, and no one stopped because of this. They just looked at their commander-in-chief with a reliant look. Bonnie; this fake identity of Sefer is already the brightest star in the Free Army. All politicians are counting on the politician's general to master the entire Free Army in the foreseeable future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past week, Pluto urgently transferred the commando and gendarmerie from the most elite first division to manage the new transfer to the Lenny Army. Various units. Clad is a generous sergeant, and Conti is also the pressure from the joint parliament to make them have to be generous - with the addition of a large number of new forces, the current Lenni army has more than 40,000 combat troops. This force will join the French and the Central Army in fighting the 150,000 emperors and local servants gathered in Fort Vatican and annihilating those who have fallen into the supply crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was bent down and a briefing was taken from the pocket of the saddle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Responsible for the 7th Division of the Southwestern Armenian Forest Combat and Coastal Defense 'Southwestern'. They tried the old military officers who followed the governor's government and only transferred from the station two weeks ago. To Lenny, chasing from Lennie a week ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Southwest? That was the last regular division. Plus the second Intre before. Teacher, we don't have a rear reserve team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is a bitter smile: "It is said that more troops are being recruited. The seventh division is like us, no When I encounter any resistance, there is no enemy, not even the public."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any resistance? I can understand why they slow down." Ruto slammed the whip. "I haven’t played much, but when I passed the villages and towns on the road, I was equally frightened. The village was broken into white, and all the supplies were transported away. It was ashes. The village and the burnt body are still terrifying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like the town ahead The same. I can't imagine how Lenny is crowded with refugees..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne; Seifer riding her body around "animals The horse that controlled the "green grass halo" rushed over. Since she fell into the King's River from a pontoon a few days ago, she tied this magic to her most recognized horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, it may be a little late for dinner, because there are some things to wait for the logistics column to be shipped."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "According to the report of the Central Army, they accepted more than 300,000 refugees and evacuated to Imam and Intres by inland shipping and shipping." Nami first answered Anne's question. "Is there a problem with lunch today? Yesterday And the day before yesterday is not a good solution?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie’s expression is a little embarrassed: “The coal stove has no priority. They both flattened all yesterday and the day before yesterday. The house, but today they didn't... I only arranged the picnic equipment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you wait a moment? Did you say no?" Several reports, "This is a bit strange, general. According to the report, from this afternoon, all the towns within the scope of the investigation have not been destroyed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This is very important, let us go to the scene to see. The change of each order means a certain state."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pluto's horse is getting up, and Anne beautifully adjusts the horse's head to keep up with him. The doorman was busy with the report and chased it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will not be allowed to transfer a new staff from the headquarters. The Lenny Army should have a major combat staff, but no one has forbidden me to use a lieutenant to take up this position. The meaning of the rank is only used to mark the superiors and subordinates. If someone has a personal experience enough to serve the public, he doesn't need it. I will let all the people in question try to fight the emperor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Bonnie rushed to the town after throwing out a long story. She blinked at her sister, and Annie squinted and squinted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town is not far away. When they arrived, Anne’s logisticians were digging stoves on farmland that had been forcibly harvested outside the town. The pedestrians crossed them and the outposts that were conducting an armed search, and they smashed in front of the town square in the middle of the town. The younger blonde looked at the streets around and made a chill in the summer evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I would rather see the burnt town. This kind of town always makes me think that there will be ghosts of monsters coming out from the dark, I am afraid of those "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blooto glanced at her sister and couldn’t help but smile: "Tell this in your identity and character... Annie, Not for you, really. War will generate a lot of ghosts, this is true, but the modern army organized can effectively deal with them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The topic pulled back: "Only the houses in this area have not been burned. It is very strange. They should know that we will quickly restore this to the front line base."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "...unless they still intend to continue to use it." Bruto; Luther snapped a finger, "Call the investigative forces to let them search the nearby villages with a dispersing rod. Especially pay attention to the forest that looks particularly dense. Or a big rock wall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand." The two answered in unison He turned to mobilize troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After issuing the call, the door opened a portable map while chatting with Annie. "Your cousin is more and more like a real general."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe. This man is commanding a huge, real army, Advance on the road leading to the supreme power throne. That position is very attractive..." Anne's answer sounded absent-minded. "Right, are you asking to transfer from here, Soledon?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pencil in the door of the door quickly divides the search area on a battle map. "No, I asked the generals to transfer more experienced and capable people to take up my position. Forty thousand people are too heavy for a person who won't even have two magics. I have no confidence. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne's voice is a bit low, no longer her bright soprano on weekdays. "I don't want to have a high level of magic in the combat staff. Most of Lenny's intermediate and senior mages have not participated in the last war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lieutenant stopped the work in his hand. "I really want to stay here... but I can't afford such a heavy responsibility. There should be more suitable people to take charge of the fate of these 40,000 people, like General Luther, not me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know him. You don't know who he is." Annie took a deep breath, "but you don't know yourself." You don't know what kind of possibilities you have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Possibility? I really hope to see my ability to be a competent staff member. It looks like People are coming together." Nanimen looked at a small team of lieutenants, lieutenants and captains and more senior non-commissioned officers, and threw the completed maps and pencils to the women around him. "Can you copy it, Anne?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, Lieutenant Soleilton." Annie smiled and grabbed a stack of military maps. The door handed her the underside of the section that divided the area. She picked up the pencil as a magical catalyst, read a spell, and copied all the pencil lines above to other military maps. "I think, you know that most of the magic work logic will be qualified for this position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Annie." To the captains of each team. "...search for the following areas, with the premise that the other party has magic camouflage, search for the entire area to have dinner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every squad leader sees this army The map was immediately called out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First of all, I am afraid that dinner will not appear on time." Annie shrugged and pointed to the carriage behind her. "Secondly, we have military dry food, this has priority for replenishment. Each receives it and returns to the headquarters immediately if there is any problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;******** *<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sky is all black, all the senior officers of the Lenny Army are brought together, they are all equipped with a full set of street fighting magic equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The second team shot an emergency signal flare here. We guessed it." The door fell on one knee and found the wreckage of the signal flare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A detective pastor took the message: "The third team's enchantment tracked up and found the camouflage point. It is a rock wall covered with natural vegetation. I also detected their position, but all the identified objects are in the same position..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Luther put on it seriously to make the cast action more Faster and more accurate gloves that activate defensive magic on leather, belt and leather. "The enemy buried them. The whole army is not a good sign. Start attacking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second wave of attacks is no longer an encounter, but cruel The frontal battle. The main road that can accommodate the passing of the carriage has been blocked by the emperor, and they have to send the detachment to advance from the alternate passage. The Emperor of course expected this situation, can only accommodate two people in parallel, the twists and turns of the road, but also all over the magic trap, the emperors wearing silver military uniforms picked up the spears and swords of the old times in each Defend the road. In this case, the discipline and training of the modern army is useless, and only the adventurer's original instinct is useful. The eight members of the second squad disappeared silently into this man-made martyrdom, and they also had to pay at least the same price...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this time There is Bruto in the camp of the Lenny Army; Luther, the power of such a senior pastor is enough to offset the efforts of the majority. He is full of power-enhancing magic, defensive magic, and triggered-style recovery magic, sparkling with dangerous light, like a chariot-filled chariot that smashes the other's defensive line. Swords, flames, thunder, explosions, and any attack that is enough to kill a small team is ineffective in front of Luther. He can use his arm to pick up the other side's exhausted glimpse, or he can laugh and grab the gunpoint that is being stabbed in his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is behind him, watching this extremely violent advancement, half a mouth has never been closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think it’s too lucky to be able to accidentally hit a cardinal last time. Why don’t the empire directly adjust a team of advanced casters to level? "Oh?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not everyone is willing to fight like this. Even if you accumulate the magic of the day, this attack may not last for ten minutes."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne explained with a yawn. She shared more than half of her sister's magical consumption, and certainly not very spiritual. Then a large amount of defensive magic, the magic power consumed per minute is very amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we have been going on for twenty minutes..." Resist the door and turned to look at the huge team behind him. Since entering the cave, they have captured six or seventy people. This is a small and half-continental force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fourth squad will take the prisoners out first and let the follow-up troops follow up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He just finished the order, but his eyes suddenly opened up. At the end of the martyrdom, the starry night sky is shining in front of the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a miraculous sight: the entire mountain was hollowed out by the Emperor’s engineering mages, forming a huge patio. The houses on the patio are densely covered, and the fire, the watch tower and the magic lighting are scattered. It seems that this secret base can station at least five or six hundred people. Hundreds of carts filled with fodder were parked in the square at the exit, and the soldiers were shooting at them relying on the houses and obstacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Become a battle formation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troops rushed out of the narrow area of ​​crisis, Look for bunkers in the squares that are full of cars, each preparing magic and activating your own magical equipment. From time to time, some people were hit by the enemy's attack, but the gap between the two sides' combat power gradually came out, and the imperial side's counterattack force became weaker and weaker. Although the number of troops of the Free Army is small, they are all elite assault troops with magical combat capabilities, and the emperors are ordinary soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are they protecting something inside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than one staff member saw the oddity of this battle. General Luther also noticed this. He immediately decided to force the troops to deliberately attack the building, allowing the other party's living forces to be maximally consumed on the open ground outside the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle has no suspense. Soon, the emperor's spell users were exhausted in a war of consumption, leaving only one seriously injured commander and two or three soldiers. It seems that after a great struggle, the commander finally decided to ignore the enemy troops that were preparing to break into the front and turned into the building. Seeing this scene, Bruto immediately waved to stop the scheduled attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop. Anne, the door, we are on a few, if there are really important people inside, the more the number of assault troops, the better. First, third The squad waited for us to signal, and the rest of the teams remained vigilant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He read a few short spells and restored the dangerous ray that was entangled in the previous assault . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door whistleed softly: "Is there a person like you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "very likely." Annie replied to her sister, "So we need a real senior assault person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go." Carrying a bow, he rushed to the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a ash left on the floor of each room after the burning of the documents, but nothing is left. No traps, no interceptions. Luther's fingers tapped on his eyes, and the color of the eyes turned into a pink that "detected humans." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This side!" His short command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the target room, only one person is waiting for them. That commander. He doesn't seem to want to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about your men?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think you have won? Don't be stupid The South, the empire is far from collapse! No matter what the price, we will not collapse!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander slowly lifted up Right hand, slowly singing. His expression is not like a person who has been forced into a desperate situation, but rather a hero who is welcoming victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your mind will unite the subjects forever! Under your prestige, all human beings become brothers! The only empire of mankind, Long live! Long live! Ten thousand years old!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, he pulled out a magic item at a speed that was difficult to capture with the naked eye and started it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire room - not the magic item - exploded. The hurricane of the explosion almost flattened the entire headquarters, leaving only those large stone pillars of the Coman-style standing there. There were all kinds of frightened sounds from the surrounding warehouses. They were used to fighting, but they were not used to such a large-scale explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of people climbed up from the ashes and dust, looking at each other's gray face, and laughed. Anne and Bruto quickly shook their arms and eliminated the surrounding defensive magic before the dust settled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie coughed a few times and looked around. "The house is a trap. It's very creative, not too expensive. If we don't compress the team size, Pluto has prepared defensive magic, we can have a big loss to report."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, thank you for your defensive magic, Annie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear the door, the blonde girl’s face The smile on it suddenly solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you said, knowing the logic of most magical work can guide magical combat. You just happened to the action and the magic you used, I happened to recognize : That magic can be tested by the intermediate combat mage and get a major rank. General, isn’t it a coincidence that you brought your sister here? You really believe she has the ability to protect herself.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, why would a person with at least the strength of a major deliberately start from the second lieutenant? I think this is very obvious..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That plain helplessness When did the smile appear so old-fashioned? How much did he know? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this is for a reason, definitely not to share a unit with you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Annie said this sentence, the scene suddenly cooled down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door grabbed the back of the head and hesitated to finish his second half of the sentence: "...you are trying to get General Luther to seize the military power... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three face each other, I don’t know what to say for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... I never thought about it... How come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;布Rutto responded the fastest, raising his hand to interrupt the interpretation of the door, and bluntly changed the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a feed for the dragon, a lighthouse to guide the landing site, and a magician. It is not a secret base at all, it is an air force relay station." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door response was also very fast, and immediately caught up with a new topic: "A secret air route across the occupied area of ​​our army. It can't be for military use." The harassment attack with the precious air force is only a luxury elf. So... political use, or economic use?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Political use. Political use. Political use.” Anne Mumu repeated it three times, suddenly licking her hair and suddenly realized that “Yes, psychological blindness! We will not disperse the second place for the place that has been dispelled.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get time. I guess what he is covering."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is in unison Say the answer: "The first detachment of the Air Force. It is the emperor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second dispersal..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pluto’s voice has not fallen, a team of dragons looks like another in the warehouse area One side vacated. The dragon headed in the night glows in the dazzling silver, which illuminates the horror of the free army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The interception!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than one person subconsciously shouted. However, the ones they brought were not empty-handed equipment, and they were almost exhausted in the previous attack, and they were unable to fight against a team of dragons. At the Battle of Kengal, a silver dragon without a dragon had already played the entire Western General's magician in the palm of his hand. It was impossible for such a few people to stop the silver dragon... almost everyone immediately realized When it came to the cruel facts, I couldn’t help but bow my head and watched the silver dragon go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides one person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pluto; Luther tapped his right foot on his left toe and started his own jumping boots and jumped into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of his curse is small, but powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Lightning..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of this magic is not as good as the sunburner. But it is also one of the best tactical assault weapons in advanced magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Self-guided extended range shooting..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a must-have super magic skill. Before the masters mastered this technique in the mid-nineteenth century, the air combat could only use the clumsy method of the former free army to meet the emperor's human tactics. This technique eliminated the magician riding the dragon and let the plane and the airship rule the sky. No one can see this skill in the air, Bonnie does not have to bother to cover up her strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Emission!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge silver thunder gathered in her hand, aiming at the The silver dragon that flies away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dodge. Quick swing. Defensive enchantment. Silver Dragon's shouting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie; Safir turned over in the air and landed gently, visually measuring the effects of his magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hit. Crush, crush, and pulverize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver thunder, adding a new star to the other side of the sky-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new star falls ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven’t waited for Bonnie to cheer on the victory, and Yinlong immediately pulled it up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This magic is very strong, but it is not enough to kill the silver dragon. It is a pity that the general, we failed to kill the emperor."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is for the door. His eyes are full of envy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is what Annie said. This scene is very familiar to her. She knows the reason for the last time, but she doesn't know this one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me...no, you count it. One week. Not enough to Lenny, is Soma or Taranto? Reserve mobilization? At us In the era of the Emperor, there were 4.4 million reserve troops ready to be mobilized, which may be less in this era. There is only one possibility, only one. That guy would rather die than delay."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie slowly stated that she looked a little... panic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A spring is pressed to the end, there are two possibilities. This spring may collapse completely or bounce back with maximum strength. The empire is a spring. We are stepping on it with all our strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne seems to have caught the conversation. "That is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They didn't give up here because it can be used as a position to enter Rennie again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The alliance between DeLand and Hongrinas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Lieutenant Soledon. At a fast speed, I reported to General Lopez and Marshal Fox, asking all the troops from the Western and Eastern Lines to the Red Fleet to enter the highest alert situation. We have won the war and we can't let it lose it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The change has already taken place. Before that, bury the victim first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie Quiet Add a word to the end of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May+78 Fortune in the early morning of June 18, 1668<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accompanied by the Imperial Air Force's military song "The Flying Coman", Gustav slowly walked down the dragon until someone moved to the stairs. The emperor's eyebrows are still locked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is more than a headache. The night's flight consumed too much energy from the Emperor's Majesty and his dragon, and his eyes were covered with bloodshot eyes. But the biggest problem is the sacred lightning that is forced to pick up at the penultimate relay station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Royal Armor can block most of this magic, but the rest of the power still makes him half-length. Fortunately, the emperor always has the best magic potion around him, but even a complete healing potion can't completely compensate for the mental damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Report status to my cabinet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emperor in the past few months The built relay landing site was almost occupied. On the last day, he had to forcefully cross the occupied area of ​​the Free Army, and there was another unwilling encounter. His silver dragon is also very dissatisfied with the live cattle who have to eat the bloody forest. Hailana Katana (halanak is Mara's sister, she has served more than 20 emperors) - for many centuries, she only eats three-quarter cooked bone-eating steak. It is hard to say that it is royal three-point cooked. Eviscerate Steak is also an agreement between her and the Coleman ancestors to keep this silver dragon service for the royal family.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guardian Knight was a little embarrassed: "Sorry, Your Majesty, but... But this thing is characterized as an empire. I am not You know, you have to go to the reporter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor stopped. "Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your sister, Your Majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, ancient The head of Stavs is getting more and more painful. He saw two younger sisters in his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two are named Olia; Hugh; Coleman's first princess. Two of his first successors. It looks exactly the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Scared?" The two men spoke at the same time, and the exact same sound had a wonderful sense of resonance. "This secret is amazing."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the secret of the father is amazing." Gustav threw the crutches aside and picked up his "power" from the table. "Jokes." Here, what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me introduce this brave woman who has been with you in the past few months. She stands bravely On the front line, I watched most of the battles that began with the Battle of Lenny. As a princess, her task of appeasing the people was better than me; as a younger sister, she always supported you at the most critical moment. She Risking his life in the fight against the same thousand enemy mages in Kengal, rescued me from the tiger's den. Remove the disguise, Wei Wei?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ok." Renee Karmer read the whisper of magic, and reappeared the original features that he had not used for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gustav blinked. The woman in front of her is no longer her own sister who is perfectly inaccessible, but a civilian girl with a gentle smile. She is also beautiful, but not the kind of inaccessible beauty, but a gentle and strong beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered the creek on the outskirts of Kengal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to say that your illusion is almost flawless." Gustav shook his head. "I didn't see the flaw even if I was standing by the real person." Very good... What do you call it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olivia replied replied: “This is Jenica; Miss Weilun.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Juniica; Wei Lun. Yanika; Wei Lun. I seem to have heard of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Gustav’s right hand trembled slightly. That sacred lightning may have destroyed some of his nerves, and now his expression does not look so serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised the volume and shouted outside the door: "Sid; Nasser? I know you are outside the door."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid slammed into the door and gave each of the two ladies a ritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor pointed to Nika: "This brave lady is yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Security Minister unequivocally defended: "There is no such thing. If I can develop Clade; Lopez's daughter into my agent, I have already persuaded the South Government to surrender. In addition, I am absolutely I don’t want to have such a charming agent around my own person, and the natural loss is a bit big.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh.” Hearing the name of the biggest enemy, the emperor’s expression Nothing changed, only the eyebrows were raised. "I guess the family life of the general is a mess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 inserted in disappointment: "It’s just blood. It’s a little abrupt, but I never thought that blood can determine anything, whether it’s ability, opinion or position.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh? "The emperor's scepter tapped the ground gently. "You may have misunderstood the purpose of our country, Miss. The Imperial aristocracy is not dead." A stupid class with a blood and self-righteousness. We are an excellent group, just because we are constantly accepting new and excellent blood. All good, trustworthy new blood will get the position of the imperial aristocracy and cannot fulfill their duties. People will be deprived of their status, and magical ability is the purpose of assessing all of this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
