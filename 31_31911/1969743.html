			<div id="content"><br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Author: Shen pure thanks of what, in fact, this novel I've seen a lot of recommendation in a different place, but out of fear for the epic work of (tj The fear?), has not had the courage to look at it. In fact, whether it is set rigor or history, it is very close to my appetite; many of the spoofs inside add fun - can see a lot of spoofs, does this represent the fall of one's nature? So it is a very enjoyable reading process, thank you very much, laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Text "Of course, God rolls the dice. But it is only a winner." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(-"Evolution of the Universe"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;butterflyinstorm, the first time I saw this topic, Even before I read the preface of the author, I vaguely guessed the original intention of the author to take this topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butterfly effect in meteorology, or turbulence in fluid mechanics, or chaos theory in physics, or: initial conditional sensitivity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The depth of my understanding of this aspect is far less than the extent to which I can explain it in a simple way. I can only make a predecessor's analogy: it is like you. Hold a pencil and stand on the table with a sharpened nib, then let go of the hand - which side will it fall to the next moment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows. Depending on the flatness of the table, it may depend on a sudden breeze. It may also depend on the adhesion of the finger to the pencil and even the wear of the pencil tip. It is more likely to be the density distribution of the pencil itself...if not Let the pencil fall down countless times, from a statistical analysis, it is difficult to determine which is the cause of its overturning. This is the initial conditional sensitivity. In a non-equilibrium environment that does not have a strict order, any change in related factors will cause the pencil to fall back and become a ready-made fact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amplify to a large system, as well. The tiny disturbances pull up an attractor, and then gradually expand like a wave of water. If the system itself is in a state of extreme chaos, even if the butterfly flaps its wings, it will also stir up a storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Butterfly in the Storm" theme of the world is based on such a theory, whether for love or something more intrinsic, in order to re-enter In pursuit of the life of the person, Reese became the butterfly that disturbed history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it comes to settings, then the setting itself is very, very interesting - at least for me - because of some and other back to the past novels Different, the "historians of later generations" are not going to change and create history, but to let the history of their two attractors not be disturbed, continue to go to the established, and at the same time want to achieve themselves. The ultimate goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It feels like a kind of difficult acrobatics that dangerously balances itself and the known history. However, butterflies can't see the coast thousands of miles away. Just as history is not a pencil, it can't be reproduced thousands of times. Then analyze the most basic factors from statistics, or pick the most suitable direction to make it fall. They did something, but they couldn’t judge the exact result of these things, and the impact was big or small. The arrow of time has already been shot from this point. Regardless of the will, the reader of the book of history becomes a participant and loses the "possibility" forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reese said the wish, the fate let go of the hand, and the pencil fell, marking the only direction. The future where you are headed, this is the place where people can't see it at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s suspense, then this is the biggest suspense I’ve experienced after reading the first volume – how do you balance and evolve this history, can their goals be So get? Even if he would endure the door (the horrible waiting for the leading actor, the first volume did not show up and explode), how should Rees face him. The memories that they share have never happened, can love still be expected? What kind of track will the distorted history drive to? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(For the bad taste, I personally hope that the author says: Everything is not important, the important thing is love! It is love~~~; pp) <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what exactly is this suspense caused? From my personal reading-< =""="">-, aside from the appreciation of settings and historical views, there are still many places to improve ^^ First talk about what is suspense. The interpretation of Cihai is: 1. Missing. 2. When listening to drama, film or other literary and artistic works, be concerned about the development of the story and the tense mood of the characters. In order to reflect the contradictions and conflicts in the works, writers and directors often use various methods to arouse the suspense of the audience or readers in order to enhance the appeal of the works. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many ways to set suspense. First of all, my reading experience is divided into three types according to the ending suspense setting. The first is the orthodox method, the guiding method. The fuzzy ending and the nature of the story, that is, the reader can not judge what kind of ending the author will lead, can only follow the book to experience. Many of the famous works we read are like this. The author and the biased efforts to "hide" in it, leaving behind a realistic world of words. As the reader progresses deeper with the plot, the only and most reasonable ending of the story is gradually unveiled. The second is the biggest suspense method. Such books are suspense as a selling point. People who have read Hitchcock’s books or movies will understand that at the beginning of the protagonist, the crisis is overwhelming, forcing readers to breathe. Less than the last page will never let you guess the ending, nor will the fate of the object be settled. The last one is used by many popular novels, suggesting the ending method. While watching 007, the process is extremely thrilling, but who would think that 007 will die? Who would doubt that he can win the final victory? Just like romance novels, whoever sees the final result is not lovelove~~happy ending, I am afraid that I have eaten the author's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last extension of this method is probably the universality of many fantasy fantasy sci-fi military novels, the "historian historian" method... laugh, advance the ending Rely on the process and characters to drive readers' interest in reading. Such a book seems to have no suspense, but people still look at it with gusto, for what? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, suspense has a double meaning, one is the story, the other is the character. Suspense is not purely based on the outcome. A well-themed novel, when we judge that it can never have a tragic ending (or comedy), when the story and the characters point to the light (or darkness), it does not mean that it has no suspense. In a sense, the author and the reader's wrestling have just begun from here. Without the suspense of the ending, at least one leg of the work is defeated. At this time, the author must set out with all kinds of skill and plot, let the readers care about the characters in the book, let the readers resonate with the joys and sorrows of the characters. Let the readers guess the future development and let them invest in the world of books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the process, as human beings are born, will face death. Before this inevitable outcome, it is still worth the effort for people to work hard. Bit by bit, happiness and misfortune, happiness and sadness. Process, this is an important factor that we don't think books have enough to have an outline or an end, and the only reason why the ending does not end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the author adopts the last set of suspense methods, he must spend more effort on the process, measuring the first volume of "Butterfly in the Storm". There are at least a few shortcomings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point is the structure and setting decision, it is estimated that it is not so easy to repair, I am arrogant, the author listens to it. As the opening of the whole article, the first volume had to accommodate a large amount of background and historical views, with the intention of establishing a reader's overall impression of the world and history. A big problem in setting itself is very obvious here (it will be more obvious later), this is a novel that "returns to the past", and the "past" in the novel itself is overhead. That is to say, the reader did not know the past at first. In order to make the terrible introduction of the current change clear, he had to repeat the past in various ways. In a limited text space, it is necessary to tell the story, but also to tell the story. The former seeks for the wonderful, while the latter seeks for the thick, and it is inevitable that it will be lost. And the most troublesome thing is that no matter how clear the concept of the world and its history is in the author's mind, there is still a lack of communication to the reader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This story faces the problem of "double telling", and the "history" that Reese and Miley changed has never happened before the reader. To avoid the impression of “recreating history”, the author may need to add more details and descriptions to make the consequences of the change clear and visible, causing pressure on the characters and readers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A suggestion that I am afraid that the world will not be chaotic: it is better to write two historical texts at the same time, laugh - pure advice; p)<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is from a narrative perspective. The full-view narrative is probably the best choice for this novel. But I can't help but say that the author used some lazy methods - sorry, I took Anne's and Bonnie's occasional looming conversations, the gaps between the characters and the words as a certain degree of laziness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of the individual, the best testimony is that everything is normal and logical. But it is also normal and logical that something has happened. If the author himself strongly suggests that "this is not the right thing", the effect of the foreshadowing can not be greatly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the following paragraph: "Liesha; Hermont... Alchemist? How is this possible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"What should I do now? It is rare to have the opportunity to control the fate of the entire Soma Principality..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, let’s be a slave first... oh, It’s good to be a servant.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when Anne and Bonnie were rescued at sea, I passed a trace of doubts - a merchant ship encountered a magical attack The result was actually there and only two people were safe and sound, coupled with the detection of the bronze mirror, there was some doubt about the two girls. Looking at this paragraph, some problems are even more obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be honest, this type of foreshadowing is somewhat bad for people's appetite, because the reader does not rely on reasonable derivation to draw conclusions, but is led by the author to draw conclusions. In the middle, let the captain and the sea commander, the sea commander and the alchemist, the trainee pastor and the bishop talk about whether they are spies, do not know whether their purpose is to relieve readers' doubts, or do they want to cover up? If it is the former, the reasons why everyone use it are similar: confused, broken, and a group of people's judgment is all on a horizontal line (big explosion); if it is the latter, the purpose is fully achieved; p is obvious here It is definitely not an easy task to remind everyone that there is a problem with this paragraph, but it is not to be traced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author also has a problem with insufficient clues, and the description and means of auxiliary clues are not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the shield section as an example, when I first looked at it, I probably decided that Anne (Reese) had used some way to change the thickness of the shield. To take the opportunity to beat Leonard. At that time, she didn't think of what she did to do this. In fact, I was more concerned about why she did this, whether she was a spy or not, and a person who wanted to hide her identity used a means to easily reveal her identity. Can only say that she has a reason for "not this is not possible" (cough, later discovered that I overestimated the cute heroine, she is a rib, laugh). What will Anne do if she loses to Leonard? In the front and the rear, she doesn't do anything -- except for the loss of self-esteem -- then there is only one explanation that motivates her to use magic to change the shield's only motivation, which is self-respect and triumph. Unfortunately, the author's description of Anne's character is far from enough in this respect, so I guess the second time to judge that this is not another intentional trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small suggestion. When scheduling clues, you may wish to choose a more natural method. For example, when Anne and Bonnie were rescued in this world, they would understand that the history recorded in the history books is somewhat different from the reality. In order to import the history of the world into history books, we must understand the current situation. . If in such a process of understanding, let them interact with other characters, expose clues and arrange foreshadowing, it is more logical than to present their dialogue in the dark, and can more shape the characters, and take the opportunity to describe " This is a history." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The above is only a suggestion for the following, I do not recommend that the author modify the first volume, because it is from reading-< =""="" >-, the first volume is already very good. Instead of spending time to achieve the perfection, it is better to try to fill the pit and laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last suspense question is the quote from the beginning of the text: "Of course, God rolls the dice. But it is only a winner."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Reese has entered history, she has become an unknown part, but if she is always a winner, then the fun of this article will be lost, and the unknown will lose its charm. Not to mention suspense. When the reader knows that "no matter what role, it will turn to safety," they are giving up the beginning of investing more emotions in the fate of the character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have this kind of worry because the first volume they show is too powerful and very unbalanced compared to other forces in the world. Imagine nothing but "achieve that goal" to restrict them from doing anything. It is not a question of actually doing anything, but the existence of such a powerful force, which has already caused an imbalance. After all, this history is too far away from them. Even if there is a disturbance, there will not be too many people and things that they know. If the reader also produces this illusion, it may greatly reduce the tension of this fine tampering history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, like Ionite in "The Prelude of the Tradewinds"; Hartman vaguely revealed - the law of causality across time and space - "Ten In the second monkey, the actor reached the end and realized that the beginning was the end. He had already witnessed his death. Of course, this setting is also full of fun, but unfortunately it is far less attractive than the previous one - because this modified history + twisted history + double correction of the vicious circle is very complicated and funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, finally finished the talk, come to praise the author, talk about the chapters I like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
