In front of several very large shops, there are even colorful magic lanterns - the value of which is worth hundreds of elves of white gold coins, is a luxury that is uncompromising. Yan Yanyan, laughter and laughter, filled these few blocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a huge derivative of the wealth of the New World. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only by walking here, I feel the atmosphere of our time. This memorable light is bright..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde girl still wearing black tight-fitting leather is walking on the street and feeling deeply. Wearing this tight-fitting clothing, her "post-class model" grade is exceptionally dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only the red light district is the eternal existence that spans all ages."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walk in The brown-haired girl around her face has been filled with red clouds, and I don’t know where to look. In all directions, women are dressed in extreme eroticism. Although not very exposed, it is very provocative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because underwear is not popular in this era? That kind of collar..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "If you continue, you should reach the sex scale. Sister, stop here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne suddenly stopped at the front door of a large shop, staring Look at a glass lamp. It is a glass magic lamp with a very beautiful shape and a very complicated shape, which exudes an iridescent glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! There is a Baroque magic lamp! This is two hundred years of antiques!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This technology, is about to catch up with our time?" Bonnie also stopped and looked at the appearance of the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluating the craftsmanship of this glass, the two sisters looked at it with regret: "It seems that you can't make money by opening a glass workshop..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two men commented on the level of glass blowing in the seventeenth century, countless hungry men around their eyes were straightened up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two...please, how many platinum coins are there together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I 5 or 5!" "10!" 10 white gold coins, already an amazing price - ordinary female slaves, can already buy a dozen home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beauty female warriors, please hit me with the knife in your hand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The two reacted, and they stayed where they shouldn't stop; they rushed to get out of here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good, terrible! People of this era, don't you tell?" Anne complained as she flew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this era, there shouldn’t be a good woman who hangs around here at night. It’s still our fault. It’s also running, sister’s The sound is not breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two sisters trotting all the way to the pace of the hostess in front. The position of Retha is very conspicuous - within 20 meters of her side, there is no one. In the evening, all the magical costumes and accessories on her body exude a golden brilliance, which makes people dare not approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong, slaves a and b? Are there boring flies chasing? Spear line form!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The alchemist's arm trembled, and a chain of thorns slammed in the air! The chain was shot straight out of the golden scepter, and the road was blocked across the street, causing a scream and many passersby being bruised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This... is a new form?" Annie asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, spearline, you can finally attack remotely." Reza put away the scepter, "Our celebration is coming." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie and Bonnie looked up and saw a huge sign across the top of the head: "Elove Dynasty Hotel: The magic in the store is invalid, absolutely safe!". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Packaged here? It really is the best. The Nassau Navy is generous..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I think it should be paid by Soma Principality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people walked into the bar and found a quiet corner to sit down . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light passes through the stained glass and turns into a dark red, on the bar filled with dishes and glasses. A touch of inexplicable fog, surrounded by the entire bar, with a good Xinzhou tobacco on the corner table. The sailors who liked to swallow the clouds and smog went there to take the tobacco and use the cigarette paper to wrap it. The introduction of tobacco from the New World has become a common practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that people use paper to make cigarettes, the two sisters look at each other with regretful eyes: "I am afraid I can’t make money by cigarettes..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A bottle of white wine, two bottles of lemonade." After sitting down, Reza said, "Annie, take some tobacco. Do you both smoke this thing?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, don't smoke." Sister Bonnie shook her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I used to smoke, but now I am quit..." Annie answered with a slight melancholy, stood up and took the tobacco and cigarette paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After taking the cigarette paper, Leisha skillfully rolled up the flue-cured tobacco and popped a magical flame to ignite the smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the flames that Reza’s fingertips popped up, and thinking of her piled up hot rubber, the two sisters could only look at them with regretful eyes. : "The road to the match is also blocked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are we financially so miserable when we return to the past?" Annie was finally unwilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because it was the Age of Enlightenment." Bonnie replied calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waitresses in low-cut sleeveless tops walked around the table, occasionally giving alcohol to the big people and serving the side dishes. The laughter echoes in the mist, and the casual topics that men at sea can talk about are women or women. The ladies sat quietly in the corner, sipping their own wine and lemonade, and kept a reserved. Only a group of people in the corner are saying some lines that are not very environmentally friendly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, today you can escape your life, purely because of Leonard; the generosity of Kikawi’s brother! He sacrificed his position and used In exchange for the lives of your scum! You ask yourself, who has no blood on hand? Whose hand has no sin?” Katzmi; Stewart waved his arms with impatience, toward the group of pirates who had just been forgiven. Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! No! We are guilty!" A uniform answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kazmi nodded with satisfaction: "So, all of you guys have to work hard to redeem, rehabilitate, re-do people, and fight for the head to repay Kekavi! If you let me know which of you will run to be a pirate later, I will use this knife to smash his head!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗷!Never!" The answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You guys..." Reza smothered the smoke, and the heel slammed the floor with a heavy sway and stood up with a cold face. "Lenard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha?" The half-elf turned his head from a distance, and his face was slightly drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on!" The alchemist put a wooden wine glass in his hand on the table, loudly. Upon hearing this tone of command, Leonard even woke up for three points and hurried over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, yes..." The half-elf turned his face bitterly, thinking about how to drive out these fierce gods; he just turned back and he was paralyzed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner is empty, and all the former pirates did not know when they escaped. Even the captain of Kazimi, who had no match in the world, had a look on his face that "the woman of the big brother couldn't provoke", slipping out from the front of the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, doing a good job." Resa took a scorn and sat back, a faint wine fragrance floating between her lips. . She pointed to the vacancy around her, facing Leonard: "Sit down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf leaps and squats, some sit down. He carefully reached out and tried to touch the slender jade hand next to him; but every time he saw it, he carefully retreated and never held Reza's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Actually... I am no longer serving the Elf Navy," he said eagerly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," Reza smiled and rolled a cigarette. She sent it to her mouth with her right hand and ignited with her left index finger. "Because it is me." ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard once again stunned and couldn't speak. He had intended not to know, but this woman is too... too...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you said, I want you to bless you." The alchemist spit out a cigarette, and the smoke appeared dark red under the light. "But this blessing, should you pay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remuneration?" Leonard asked with a trepidation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, remuneration. By the way, my debt is hard to return..." Resa smiled. "Since you are unemployed, Why don't you come to me as a guard? Use it as a guard to pay off debts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guard?!" Leonard’s eyes lit up, the wine rushed and his face changed. It’s flushed, “That is, you, have you accepted...?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, his right hand was quietly and gently placed on the leisha On the back of the left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I didn't say it was 'this kind of guard.'" The alchemist took a sip of smoke if nothing had happened, then pressed the cigarette to the half-elf On the back of the right hand. "Convergence point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people in the pub have covered their ears, as a hero who has not heard of the island, "Linger" Leonard Kikawi’s screams. Anne and Bonnie looked at the half-elves in front of them with a very sympathetic look, but did not dare to say more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the cigarette butt hot to such exaggeration?" the blonde girl asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because it was the Age of Enlightenment." Bonnie replied calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, when will the debt be paid off, of course, I have the final say. When it is paid off, I will return the things I have protected to you. "Reesa is starting to roll new flue-cured tobacco again." So, start working together tomorrow, Mr. Kakawi. Hey, by the way, the guy with the knife can also bring it together."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lisa's slender left index finger flicks, and the red flare flashes again. At the root of her index finger, carry the ring that he gave her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There has been no bed for a long time...a little sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak this sentence At the time, Anne; Sefer relaxed in bed, staring at the white ceiling of the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautifully decorated rooms, solid floors, carved wooden bed, clean sheets... these things have been completely and completely long gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, sister, are you beginning to miss the life on board?" The brown-haired girl lying next to her with a slight irony, "That I don’t even have to change clothes every day, sleep in the corner of the cold bottom compartment every day?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, now our youth, and this perfect figure, are also like a dream. Isn't this all your sister doing it? The wishes are fulfilled." Bonnie snorted and grinned. The tone began to complain. "I think we still have to find a way to make some consumables. Sanitary cotton may not be there immediately. The bathing conditions in this era are also terrible..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I think we're going to change the subject. Let's talk about the next step." Annie wiped the cold sweat on her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie chuckled: "Ah, sister, are you still using discussion? I am sure to follow the man's footsteps. Where is the man now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it should be the capital of the southern free country, Lenny? Wait for me to check..." Anne didn't know where to pull out a book, "The door; Hugh; Ke Man Biography comes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her sister caught her hair and was surprised: "Sister, you have this... all with it? It’s really ready."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny ignored her and started reading the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, look at the location first... When you were a child, you were poor, living poor, barely hunger, and had no money to buy toys, comic books and books. Seven years old Every day, the door is going to the field to pick branches, dig the roots, get the firewood, and carry them back home, piled up next to the living room for cooking and heating at home. Because of poor life, the door is a child. After only four months of elementary school, I dropped out of school, and I have not received formal school education since then. But he held a book in the middle of the night and leaned on the stove to read it. He gradually accumulated a wealth of knowledge and became a Ke. The Prime Minister revered by the Man. The rich knowledge that Naimen had later was that he had learned hard and self-study for a long time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading here, the blonde girl clapped: " Well, yes! We might as well go to the area where we can pick up the branches..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...Lenny is a big city, I think it should be no To the branches. This story should be nonsense. In the seventeenth century, there were really toys and companies. Painting it? "Bonnie calmly to this confused sister's head poured cold water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well...then the next one...the doorman got a gift when he was a child--a small axe, excitement, he cut the cherry tree at home When Dad found out to ask him, the little guy admitted it very easily. Dad not only did not blame him, but praised him as an honest good boy... Yes, we went to the house with cherry trees!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cherry tree...? Even if there is, the cherry tree is left with stumps."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ...then look for a cherry stump..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister, funny should be appropriate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "So, the next one is good..." Annie turned over another page. "When the door was a child, one night, my mother suddenly fell ill, and it hurts to turn over and over in bed. I was so sweaty. Doctor. Just at the doctor's home, when he heard the report of the door, he hurriedly picked up the medicine box and went out. At this time, the mother had already gotten to the ground and screamed. After the break, I said that I had to go to surgery immediately, otherwise I would be in danger. At that time, there was no electric light. The door was quickly brought to the kerosene lamp at home, and it was lit on the table, but the doctor shook his head and said, the light It was too dark, and I couldn't see it clearly after surgery. So I thought about it, and finally thought of using a mirror to reflect light to help doctors operate. This is why he invented 'mirror surgery' in the future..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you want to find a doctor, not a pastor? And, when was the surgery invented, shouldn't it be in the age of the 17th century?" Bonnie was merciless. The fact that the fictional writer’s fictional story was revealed, “In my impression, there was surgery in the 18th century.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This...’First time joining the army’, Nike; Hugh; Cole joined the Southern Army at the age of seventeen and became a defender of the free country.” The sweaty sister quickly flipped through the catalogue of the book, “The Spring and Autumn Period of the College”, and then the highest in the Empire. School, University of Koman Imperial University Law, become a high school student. 'Traveling years,' and then traveled all over the country, escaped the catastrophe of 30 years of war. 'First Lu Hao', joined the exiled Keman Dynasty army at the end of the 30 years of war, and turned the tide, success Recovering the Second Empire of the Empire and becoming the hero of the empire..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie sighed: "So far. I am sure, this book The first half is all forged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this is too unreasonable," Bonnie frowned. "He must have wanted to cover up what he wrote his biography. Who was the man who was born?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne did not hesitate to answer: "1649."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, sister, you remember really clearly...and not to mention the whole This book uses the name of 'Hugh; Coman', and does not mention the strangeness of the name used. What year did the man get the name of the emperor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This, in the early 1790s? Five or six years before the end of the 30-year war era."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How old he was that year ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne's face is slightly blue: "This, probably... 40 years old? Well, as a male, age is acceptable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, sister, would you believe that a young man with sufficient ability would do nothing during the middle of the 30-year war? He has hidden or played down the experience of youth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I don't know why the last wish sent us to this era, I have a hunch, If your sister goes to find that person, the dream is likely to be shattered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one will deliberately cover up their glorious resume."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Moreover, history has been changed by us. No one can say anything about the future..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A sentence of analysis rushed into the sister's ear, she wanted to avoid listening, but could not stop myself from hearing this somewhat cruel analysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown-haired girl clung to her sister’s shoulder and continued to persuade: “Do you still have to go? With our ability to lead the entire era, even if not Looking for that man can also lead a good life. Why do you want to crush your good memories? I really don't want to see your sister broken your dreams."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Thank you, Mai Li..." Anne's eyes were slightly moist, calling her sister's original name. She knows that her sister's concern for her is all from the bottom of my heart. She also knows that her sister's analysis is not wrong, and this is probably true. Merivale; Quillahiya was a genius two hundred years later, and also a genius two hundred years ago. "Let me think about it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is silence in the room. The two men stood on their backs and looked at the ceiling quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night shines through the window and casts on the ceiling and walls. It was dark in the beginning, then dark blue, light blue, and gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first night after returning to land, they stayed up all night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...Ganda, get up! Get ready to go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first 缕When the light was cast on the ceiling, the penetrating voice of Reza came from the downstairs of the hotel; she always got up so early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? These thieves who are defeated are also responsible for me? What kind of jokes are legitimate defenses, legitimate defenses! Damaged things? You are responsible for it! Who asked them to see gold?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls from the later generations squatted on the window sill and secretly poked their heads, looking at the golden figure of the rage below the hotel. Eat and snicker. Outside the hotel stood at the foot of Ganda, who was watching the night, and was covered with faint greedy thieves and innocent passers-by; as long as he was curious about this golden big guy, he was knocked down by it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, Leonard also ran out, so that he would persuade the onlookers and the protesting shopkeepers, and ordered the former pirates to clean up the mess. It took a long time to get everything done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This trip seems to be very interesting." Bonnie gave a sigh of relief, "a freelance alchemist" and 'The miracle of Seal Bay'... This calculation may cause a big error."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I decided, Mai Li." Looking at the busy people below, Annie suddenly spoke up, and her voice was calm and powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I must go find the man. I believe that he will not live up to my expectations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If he is upset? Like I said This is very likely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, let's talk about it later. Maybe, killing that negative man may be... his historical mission, we It’s just a matter of taking over. Anyway, history has changed, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This...” is accustomed to controlling everything in the calculation of the sister’s eyebrows Twisted into a ball, "Do you want to spell the half to go to the magic book, sister?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only know one point: if I do I may regret it. But if I don't do it, I will regret it." Reese; Quillahia raised her right hand and slowly clenched her into a firm fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I must find that person, no matter what the end result. Certainly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown The girl smiled softly, her right hand extended, and stopped her sister's hand in midair. The palms of the two men collided and a crisp "beep" sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough... If you give up, you are not the sister I know. Then, go together."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meliyahna; Quillahia sighed and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie stretched out a big stretch, facing the dawn, pointing her finger at the East: "That is going to Lenny, let's go!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because it is the Age of Enlightenment...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;June 15, 1665, one week away from Lixia At that time, history has split. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the southwestern trade wind is still blowing up today, and the southwestern trade wind will blow up as usual tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Butterfly in the storm; trade wind "trade wind" finished)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trailer<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traveler returning from the East returned to his native country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unexpected visitors visited the capital of the Republic of the Union. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest city in the South, the free city of Lenny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What store is good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's better..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night of the coup that was disturbed, the army stationed in advance, the magic and fire that were interlaced in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hero who is controlled by fate, and the heroine who ignores fate, smashed in iron, blood and fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I warn you, don't cross this line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History is not the only one Possibility, sometimes it will appear twice at dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a double twilight that leads in different directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The reason we exist here is not to change history!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Storm The second volume of the butterfly, the volume of the heavy, "twiligh". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lenny...burning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twilight in the winter, it looks particularly long . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brief postscript to the volume of the letter of the wind<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final is a volume. But this volume is just the beginning. The author also wiped the hard sweat... The work that is not mad, the road ahead is long (laughs). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
