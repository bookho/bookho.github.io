			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗒嗒!嗒嗒!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood red BMW four-legged fly, step On the paved avenue, the rhythmic fast drum sounds broke the silence of the plateau city in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rider is alone, and one is not with him. I don't want to bring it, I can't bring it. The horses that can keep up with this BMW may not have one in the whole city. No, it may not be possible to find the whole country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a blessing to say that it’s BMW. The city is located on the plateau, and the high horses on the plains will have some strength when they arrive here, let alone fly all the way. Although the local horse is hard-working and resistant to the plateau, it is very short and cannot be quickly attacked. This bloody horse can not only fly but also be durable. It is really a good one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Feifan Ma, the horse owner is also extraordinary. As long as you look at his techniques and techniques, he knows that he must be a war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under his skillful tempo, the horse speed is getting faster and faster; in a flash, the Brick Avenue is coming to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One wall, high in front of his eyes; two huge iron-enhanced gates, standing in the center of the Bluestone Avenue, tightly closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the gate of the city, the red brick square is squared into two oriental square characters: "Xiping"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest and most sturdy city on the plateau, Xiping. On the top of its city, there is a yellow flag of "Tang" flying. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Eighth Year of the War (Standard Calendar 1583), the Eastern Empire’s forces collapsed from the Western Region, Xiping was the mainstay west of Yangguan. All the Tang Dynasty territories to the west of the Yangguan have collapsed, but only this Xiping has stood up. Not only that, after resisting the tide of the barbaric national tide, the Orientals rebuilt a new, small hegemon with Xiping as the core. Half of the sunset plateau was reunified under the yellow "Tang" banner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the Central Plains has changed its course, it has hanged the banner of the new dynasty, and the people here still respect the "Tang" that no longer exists as its own country. For them, this year is not the 14th year of Dahua’s administration, but the Tang Dynasty’s ninety years. They call themselves "Tang", while others call their country "Western Tang". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an empire without an emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the gate is closed, the rider slammed the reins. Ma Changyan screamed and stopped in front of the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you waiting?! The curfew has not been lifted, there is still an hour to open the door!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guard The sergeant of the city gate shouted loudly and asked about his identity. There are not many people coming here. I took out an arrow from my arms and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Open the door immediately!" This sentence also followed the arrow and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sergeant picked up the arrow and glanced at it. This has never seen the arrow, and the style has been heard for a long time - the specifications of the arrow, written in the copy of each guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, may you ask..." he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The West is protecting Li Anxun!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no emperor in the Western Tang Dynasty, only the Great West is the guardian; because there were too many factions in the non-Tang people, no one could force the people to be emperor; The "barbarian tribes" and "savage city-states" all recognize only the ambassadors, and this system of protection is passed down. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 31st Tang Dynasty Great Western Capital Guard, surnamed Li, Ming Anxun, Zizi Ping, is the new commander who has just been elected this year. In the past five years with the Shatuman Khan army, Li Anxun has made great achievements and finally became the largest faction of the Western Tang Dynasty under the guise of the public. Li Anxun, as the leader of the faction, made his wish to do this new one. Make. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But adults, now so early, our bases have not sent patrols, and it is dangerous for you to go out alone! In case of encountering Warcraft or Barbarians... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sergeant could not, but had to pass the order to open the door. Just after the order was passed, the guards called him back again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are the soldiers who were worth more than last night? Before the suspension bridge is finished, call them out, be sure!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" The sergeant secretly complained that the plateau in the early spring was quite cold, and everyone would complain about it. But there is no way, because...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military order is like a mountain. This is a sentence that every Western Tang Dynasty is taught. Every Xitang man must be a soldier, regardless of his birth, whether his family is rich or not. Since the Elf Empire conquered all the human city-states and the first emperors to establish a unified dynasty, there has been no such universal military service - the Western Tang Dynasty is the first since then. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suspension bridge is not slow, but the military order is faster. Almost at the same time as the suspension bridge hit the other side, a group of disrespectful soldiers had already listed the team in front of Li Anxun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, can you see the person who left the city last night? Where did he go?" Li Anxun asked in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You...you are talking about the generals who are out of town to disarm," said Luo Ruide? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, that's him! Which direction did he go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He and his The follower took the carriage to the direction of Baizhou." The soldier pointed to the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fingers have just pointed out that the horses of the Extreme West have crossed the suspension bridge, as the wind has disappeared at the end of the road leading to the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened, sir? Stop doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver slammed The reins of the carriage, looking at the sergeant who stopped the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His tone is very rude and his voice is very strong--that is because the owner of the voice is a dwarf, a dwarf shorter than a human. Relative to the plain dwarves living on the plains of the New World, the dwarves living on the Old World are called the hilly dwarves by later ethnologists. Like most hilly dwarves, this hilly dwarf is wearing some dirty rusted body armor with the coat of arms of their family and their tribe. As early as five hundred years ago, the dwarves could forge this kind of body armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing... I always feel that something is going to happen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is back I looked over and muttered to myself. The latter half of the sentence is not in Eastern or Dwarf, but in his native language. In general, this language is called "Keman." His Majesty is a horse of the setting sun, the horses of the plateau. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, are we a little too hasty to leave? Maybe we should first help them to say goodbye to them..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have left a letter to Ziping, there should be no problem." The man replied in Dongfang. "Three years ago, I agreed with him to help him become a guardian. Today is three years. The period has arrived, he has also become a guardian, I can go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, this is a pity, you obviously can already be big Tang is a general, even a general and a great general! As long as Li Anxun is still in front of everything, what position do you want is not a word!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But there is not my home." The man replied with a faint tone and took care of his light brown hair. There are traces of wrapping up on the hair, which is the testimony of his fifteen years of time in the East. The Orientals never cut their hair, they didn't have a hairdresser there, and people wrapped their hair in the hair of the square. His costumes say that the East is not the East, and that the West is not the West. It seems to be somewhat elegant, but it has quite Western traces of tight-fitting clothes. He still has a beard and looks very mature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fifteen years, he has already engraved shallow wrinkles on his face. For fifteen years, the young man who was a hero in his life has become a middle-aged man. Only dark white skin, still no change; even after fifteen years of time, the skin color will not become the dark yellow of the oriental. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, it’s not a matter of saying that you want to be a family! The girl in this city, you don’t want to pick which one to pick..." The dwarf seems Still unwilling, the swear words of my own language blurted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf stared at his sir. After staring for a long while, he was finally discouraged and decided to follow the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, okay..." He twitched the whip and let the carriage continue along the avenue. "Can you get on the road? If you don't get on the road, you can't go to the next town before dark."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a second." The man stopped again. The horse turned and looked at the back. "There are indeed hooves, I heard it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many people?" The dwarf jumped into the back compartment and took out a heavy musket. On the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No need to be on guard, only one person." The man put his hand on the pistol at the waist and replied. "If I didn't guess wrong, it should be an acquaintance..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice did not fall, the bloody horse jumped out, and the morning wind was exhausted. Squeezed past the rider and crossed the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rui Dexiong, staying! Do you want to leave this way?!" Li Anxun loosened the reins and pointed his right hand whip to the man on the cyan horseback . "Since I arrived, you will not want to go one step further!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s still coming." The man, known as Luo Ruide, sighed. "You have already done the protection, what is the use of my stay here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If even you are gone, the reconstruction of Zhaohua, Who should lead the Wesser II army?!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Directly refer to the vice commander as the orthodox leader. As before, I am the commander of the two armies. It should not be the norm of the country." Luo Ruide answered calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If that is not the normal state of the country, as long as you are the general of the generals, you will be the best general, the generals of the squad, the generals of the pillars, what do you want to do?" OK!" The tone of the guardian is getting more and more urgent. He was originally a charge-type military commander. "If you don't have you, we can't resist the attack of the last time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not my credit, or the soldiers fighting bravely In order to win, according to our original agreement, in three years, I have helped you get the highest position in the country and helped you eliminate the biggest threat of the country. Now, I have to go home." Speaking of hometown At that time, Luo Ruide’s eyes passed a trace of undetectable desolateness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say, where am I going to treat you? Is it because I was busy with arranging personnel a few days ago, did not give you an official position? Or, you are dissatisfied with the present Position? No matter what, it's a good talk! Just because you have re-established the achievements of the whole army, how can you not be over-rewarded! It is enough to rely on your actual combat skills to raise the ranks!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Anxun’s hand is waving vigorously in the air, and the tone is getting more and more exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That again, you are also a famous master of the Qing dynasty! If you let you leave, what should others see? Li Anxun? Reward and punishment, suspicion Do you want to wear such a reputation to me? Now, although it is not the moon, the sun has not yet risen. I admit, I don’t have the ability to follow people’s ability under the moon, but I still know how to cherish it. Talent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know your difficulties, so I have to leave. If I don't leave, I don't have a suitable position in this new command. Luo Ruide smiled bitterly, and his face was a little sad. "I am a barbarians after all, not a Middle-earth. Even if I learned the Five-Year Law in the Qing Dynasty, I was still a barbaric. By virtue of the military, I can still If you rise to the generals, the generals will not be convinced, and your position of the extreme protection of the West will be in jeopardy. You will not only want to be a five-year guardian? For your future I can continue to serve as a guardian, I have to go, I am flat."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which guys think so? I will go back and dispose of them all in military law!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Zi Ping, all protect not General, can't be 'outside, the military order is not.' You are the military order itself, you must obey. Now the Datang is completely tied to you, you can never use it. Not to mention, I am tired of it, I want to go home. It’s been fifteen years...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, the middle-aged man turned to dismount and was deeply impressed by Li Anxun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't do this!" Li Anxun turned over from the moment, because the action was too urgent, and even stunned. "We are the brothers of life and death, why bother!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, do you agree?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Li Anxun stared at each other, kept staring, confirming that the person was serious. He did know that if this barbaric rose to the general, all people would not be convinced. In the Eastern Empire, the true power of the individual is not important. What matters is other things. The guardian of the Western Tang Dynasty stayed for a while, and finally struggled to squeeze out a few words from the mouth: "You go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brown hair Luo Ruide straight up The cold face showed grateful expression. He shook his hand and said: "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two turned over the horse at the same time, reaching out and hitting each other. No more words are needed, and all the hurricanes and vertical and horizontal strategies in the past three years are contained in this palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your hometown, I remember it is in the west of the Great Desert? You said it before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. It is very far west of the Great Desert." Luo Ruide replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The west side of the Great Desert... Well, it may be difficult to have a goodbye." When referring to the "Great Desert," Li Anxun’s whistle Lightly shake. "Is there a family member at home?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although I haven’t seen it for fifteen years...but there should be a lady and a daughter, but she should be remarried. Yes. I was so jealous of her before I left," the man's voice still has no emotional fluctuations, as if to describe other people's things. "If I didn't come back for three years, she would have to remarriage. I didn't expect it to be fifteen years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe she hasn't remarried yet, place The official has already given her a plaque to come. "The guards are comforting." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, we don't have a saint's way, and we don't encourage women to keep the festival. I personally want her to remarriage, otherwise it is very difficult to feed." Daughter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mess of horseshoes came from behind, and the guards of the guards arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I forgot that your hometown is not in the Middle Kingdom." Li Anxun took the horse and transferred the horse. "Then, I will be here. If you want to come back, you can come back at any time... However, with your ability, you will be able to make a difference in your hometown. If you have a chance to see you again, I hope we are still brothers." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We will naturally be brothers." Luo Ruide pulled out a black arrow from his arms and threw it. "This is my general order, and I have trouble collecting it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Anxun took the black token and took it into his arms, taking another one from his arms. The letter came and cast it back. "Come and not go, indecent. You ask me one thing. I will also ask you one thing at the end. When you arrive at the Western Zhou Dynasty, you can give this letter to the state there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Ruide steadily intercepted the letter, showing gratitude in his eyes, said: "Thank you. Then, there will be a period later, Ziping. My name used in the West is carat. Klaad leopace, if you have something to find me, use this name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Krad? Lopez... Carat De Lopez... I remembered it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guardian drove the horse and repeated the name that was very swearing for him. "But for me, you will always be my brother-in-law Luo Ruide, I will always keep a military position for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I Or buried bones in the wilderness, or go home to support the elderly, I am afraid that this life will not incite the knife again." Klad; Lopez replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a demon in the big desert, all the way safe. Driving!" The guards finally patted his shoulders, hit the Malay, and headed for Xiping. And go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It will be again, Ziping." Klad; Lopez looked at the bloody horses of the guards and the Guards, and then turned the horses back on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
