The area of ​​Lianggang is mostly in the West Bank, and the docks and maintenance areas that do not require the speed of throughput are rushed to areas with poor hydrological conditions on the East Coast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the north wing of the East Port wall of the phase port, it is a huge dock. <br /><br /><br /><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br The old oak, which was purchased from Sanson, was pulled out of the warehouse, and the new wood bought from the country was piled up on the dock. More, new docks are extending to the sides, engineers hired from the entire civilized world are digging into new docks, magicians are debugging the water gates and drainage systems; while the gold of Phase Port is summoned by speculators, It also summoned people who have the ability to build the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This large coastal dock looks like a row of teeth in the bay, with more than 200 large and small merchant ships and warships built and repaired here; Behind this row of teeth, after crossing the bar, warehouse and docker's residence in the port area, you can find someone who controls the row with gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Hengqu Zhang’s residence in the phase port, the largest one bought was located near the dock and dock area. At that time, the family's industry was built around the shipbuilding industry, and it maintained the power of thousands of people by controlling trade and buying shipyards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mansion purchased for the convenience of the people in the port to do the coolies and instruments, now publicly hangs the "Yellow towel Taiping Dao State Station in Hong Kong" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Taoist country has not sent an ambassador to the governorate of Fort Vatican, the only embassy that Zhang Shiyi used to contact the allies of the phase port. channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even this connection is only the second use of the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first use is naturally to build a distant ocean fleet for the new peace road. The family that used to build ships for others, after being a Taoist country, became the second-largest shipowner in Phase Port. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new sergeant Miss herself is returning to the country by a huge multi-packed sailboat. She knows the power of a new naval fleet. If it can block the connection between the eastern states of the Daoist State and Zhang Fu, she can use the new army to break through the states and counties that are still unwilling to surrender to the central government and have strong religious fanaticism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, everyone staying in this building shoulders the important task of building a fleet for the country with the profits earned before; the owner of each shipyard The foreman and the agent broke through the threshold of the embassy...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reasonable to say that this should be the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, what is going on here? We have to find a way to house these seven hundred people?!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small mixed-race girl holding a list of people in her hand, looking at the crowd in the yard, complaining to her companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wore a robes of a Taoist monk, and the hem of her clothes was too long compared to her petite body. If Bonnie Seifer sees her dress, she would probably describe it as "a junior high school girl wearing a stolen adult dress." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this Miss Di Meiyi is one of the most competent directors of the Dao’s embassy today. Under her management, she manages dozens of vessels under construction, recruiting and expelling six or seventy people every day, and inspecting twenty or thirty different properties every week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven hundred people are actually not too many, and a slightly larger yard can stand down. But if the seven hundred people are all blond young women, wearing the same simple, sack-like gray cloth old clothes, gathering together is really a kind of non-daily impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other girl who answered her is another girl. She is also wearing the costumes of the Taoist people, but it seems to be more suitable: she is the pure oriental blood of the yellow skin, and her bloodline even looks more pure than most people in the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Miss Yin Rujing said a Coynean with an accent, and let the guests and mercenaries of the embassy suspect that she is actually a teacher Come to the secret confidant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of outsiders, the embassy’s agent, the white glove “Huai Cui Xing”, is composed of two young ladies: petite and lively Trey Di Meiyi is responsible for the operation, and the serious and ruthless people of the country, Yin Ruo, are responsible for monitoring. I don’t know which big lover’s illegitimate daughter or outside room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two female supervisors have the strength of entering the magician at a young age, and they are also famous in this black and white. When the sea division swept the head of the snake, they did not dare to move the two Zhang’s agents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperament of Demi’s sloppy mouth pours out his dissatisfaction: “We don’t want this kind of manpower? These seven hundred people, Don't talk about literacy. Are you afraid that even the Coyman language is not good? We need accounting, supervision, security, and documents. The more people who can use magic, the better. Recently, more and more people are eyeing us. The reliable manpower left in the phase port is getting less and less. Every boat and town should be transferred from the phase port. Is the Qingniu House a bottomless hole?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi led the fleet to the east, took away the elites of the six thousand phase port and their relatives; after the cross-river regained the green cattle house, the rest of the people immediately acted "In order to respond to the requirements of the sergeant," buy a boat to buy a ship, the official of the official, went to the country. After all, the Taoist country is a big country comparable to the total of the free nations. The ranks of any state and county are far better than those of a documentary or supervisor in the phase port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yin Rujing said: "These are given to us. It’s already good. There are hundreds of slaves who have been brainwashed by magic. Probably to relieve brainwashing, and then reschedule it. You can solve fifteen calculations a day, and you have to solve two months without saying anything... We can't do this at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She glanced at the blonde girls on the court. Most people said that they would not be able to tremble, but their faces still seemed to be in horror. Rabbits caught in the wild; but some girls' eyes are insensitive, and some can be seen to hide hatred deeply in the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are basically nowhere to go, no talent and no danger... with our current staff, probably only Train these people slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seven hundred people... How much does it cost to ration and accommodation? Plus training costs, big deficits. The big deficit that accumulates every day in a blink of an eye. If there are so many people in the family before, they can let them be maids, but we have no more than 300 mercenaries. How can these girls not see sailors? ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that this batch may not produce positive profits for half a year, Dimei has a big head. Huai Cui Xing is basically a trade leather bag company, and it is unlikely to accept this group of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the Seventh Fleet thinks is the case, is it bought by the blonde? This is not even blocked by the way we resell it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Di Meiyi has begun to complain, Yin Ruyi erected a finger, shook in front of her eyes, whispered persuaded: "Okay, work. Since things Already in our hands, we have to train these girls into our own people. If the elder sister decides, she will do so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence The words were like a pot of cold water pouring on the head of Di Meiyi, and it ruined her complaint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay. If it’s a big sister, no matter what the difficulties, I will find a way to pull them. Seven hundred people. To recruit at least twenty teachers. And then select forty from these people... can do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Di Meiyi took a deep breath. Thinking of "big sister", the deficit does not seem so terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no big sister to teach her and Yin Rujing literacy and magic, their two current situations, I am afraid it will not be better than the girls who are slaves in front of them. How many. It’s too common to have a debt or simply to sell it because it’s poor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if I was a big sister? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Di Meiyi coughed and used his fingertips to draw a set of expanded spells in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, how many of you can understand the Coman language and raise your hand. All of the Coman languages ​​can work directly and get more every day. More rewards... um, food.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young female director of the embassy suddenly woke up and switched to a more realistic statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't get paid now. But as long as you work hard, you will be able to get back one day."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like me. Di Meiyi added in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If possible, she also wants to be a big sister. Powerful, beautiful, cold, and use their power to drag others out of the sea. She knows that Yin Rujing thinks the same way; if the green ring is still alive, she should think so too. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally Dimeiyi will also curiously think: Who is the big sister? But she never seriously wanted to figure this out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She and Yin Rujing have a feeling: If you know the truth, it is like the sudden appearance of the big sister, the big sister may suddenly disappear from their side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a sense, their Intuition is not wrong at all. If their "big sister" wants to hide themselves, then few people can find her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Ruisi really has several plans to escape from the phase port. These plans include a transmission magic and anti-tracking program that allows her to reach DeLand, Figota, or Tsingiu House within a week; or let her invade each of the most guarded corners of the phase port<br /> Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she is not sure if these plans really guarantee that no one can track her. As Bai Rusi's magical ability has increased and she has been exposed to more and more sources of intelligence, her sense of crisis has become heavier and heavier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with her two somewhat single-sister sisters and apprentices, Bai Ruisi clearly knows that he has the excellent mind and soul that the top magician will have. The magic books she read can be easily mastered, and the spells seen in the magic net can be easily reproduced; she tried to teach magic to others, but no one else can do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like...this body would have been like these magics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the more clearly these facts, the more stress she feels. That means that there is at least one brain in the world that is as good as her, with more powerful magic power than her, and dozens of resources than her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can also guess who the mind might be - this is the most terrible thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, Bai Ruisi is in a coffee shop not far from that person, working in a coffee shop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Archbishop Bonnie Sefer is really beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although she Not visiting often, but every visit will hold a public sermon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not just a sermon here. I’ve been chasing all over the country through the transmission array. The church listened to her sermons. In the United States, Faures and even Fort Buddha, the Archbishops have plans to circulate....<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the next three In the month of innovation, will the agenda be preached? In what sessions may the chief bishops personally preach?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think it should be these..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulars in the coffee shop, enthusiastically exchanged opinions like this, and took out the calendars of each other's collections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These people are commonly known as "innovation supporters", although they do not have the will to become official clergy, but to the church to provide donations, volunteer labor and intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie Seifer himself also knows their existence. She once smiled and described these people as "rock star chasing stars" and asked "Would you like to make some glittering colorful light sticks for them?" Of course, no one can understand what the Archbishop is saying, so this proposal will not end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of these people, in this area far from the exchanges and banks, this coffee shop is only going to go down, and has the ability to hire odd jobs like Bai Ruisi Waiter. In view of the fact that innovation will oppose the teachings of alcoholism, no one dares to open a bar near this main church, and every table is also labeled with a “ban on spirits” – although Bai Ruisi sometimes sees that the supporters of the Innovation Society are red. Faces quarrel with each other, and they are no different from those of the bar street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To investigate and collect information about the Archbishop Bonnie Sefer, there is no better place than here - the boss who opened the store is like this want. Normally, those who have this kind of idea will be used by the reformed armed priests to use all methods to eliminate the year, or simply let him become his own person; but this boss can not move, can only look at this The store has openly collected intelligence and built the Bonnie Sefer official association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the investor in this store is the number one lady in the phase port, the imperial elder Princess Olia Hugh Coleman. She appointed her own deputy, the ambassador of Ionette Hartman, in the name of the Ministry of Security Intelligence Special Charge and the Intresas Diocese, in the key positions of the entire phase port, recruiting trainee mages and new priests. Missionary, while promoting a similar "Orthodox and Protestantism" as a whole, will be judged as a heretical religious fusion speech in DeLand. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The churches of the Port of Hong Kong tried to counter the arrogant actions of the Orthodox Church several times, but they were all suppressed by the Archbishop of Sefer. The sacred Koman empire and the free nations are ceasefire relations, which is not false; but the emperor’s sister is the spokesperson of Yinlong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that Yinlong is one of the largest shareholders of United Bank, and the entire treasury of Union Bank is guaranteed by this silver dragon. As long as Silver Dragon Mara still enjoys the steak in her favorite restaurant, the money tide of Phase Port will not stop, and all the cargo and fleet will be assembled here. Therefore, Ionette Hartman can freely open a shop in the city to explore the information he needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Bai Ruisi is a very cautious and cautious person, so she has never seen Princess Olia or Ionite since she started working. Cardinal. Whenever the settlement date arrives, Ms. Bai, the trainee mage, works hard at home. Her performance and number of shifts are all in the middle of the game, and there are not many reports submitted, because most of the time is spent on tutoring magic and the time for working is short – in short, nothing can make her the idea of ​​the parties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, it should be like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Ruisi’s line of sight has been flying to the store’s open-air area A coffee table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the sun umbrella, sitting tall and slender, with silver-white shawl long hair, dressed in blue close-fitting Orthodox priest short uniform, sharp eyebrows as sharp Sword woman. She ordered a pot of Murrayman-style black coffee. It has been renewed three times of water. I scanned it impatiently and scanned a copy of the "Sacred Magic Principles and Preface". The book was written with the delicate floral gilt words "Bonnie· Sefer's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just ordering a pot of coffee but sitting without walking is like a villain; but no one will expel her. The woman’s true identity is a special knowledge known to all empire or Orthodox temporary employees in Phase Harbor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Cardinal... Why come over today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known to the long silver hair Ionette Hartman occasionally appears as a women's dress. Because his women's posture is too natural, some people suspect that the usual male version is a fake identity, and also gave her a codenamed "Iona Hartley." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the boss is scheduled to come, Bai Ruisi will make an excuse to leave; but today she has just worked for an hour, and there are two or three hours of classes to go. Moreover, these days may be due to the fact that the Seventh Fleet brought in a large number of goods and business opportunities. The number of trainee trainers is particularly small. Now there are only three people in the whole store. She really can't find an excuse to walk away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Ionette of women’s clothing looks very annoyed and is not interested in paying attention to temporary employees in his own store. The store employs more than a dozen mages to work part-time before and after each month. Only three or four true Orthodox or informants report to him. Temporary employees like Bai Ruisi are just cover workers and labor hired by money. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cardinal Ionette put down the book in his hand and glanced in the direction of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renovation will be quite a few years in the Cathedral of the Port of Continent, but it still looks much more powerful than the new church in the Orthodox Church. The fountain at the entrance is a spring water that blesses the simple cure of disease magic. The people who come to seek medical care are constantly lingering. From time to time, some people stop in front of the fountain and squat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His gaze rises and falls with the waters of the fountain, and he remembers his new phase of the Congo Church. The church building is gorgeous and stylish, and it can’t be said to be bad in the Imperial Duran, but it’s always a door. Most of the visitors who come to listen to his sermons are more like loyal followers than tourists who are hunted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cardinal-level big man like him, if he is preaching in the empire, will definitely be packed, but here he reminds him of how many years ago he had just been from DeLand University. When he graduated from the seminary, he was less than twenty years old when he was sent to the memory of the province of Figota. The Orthodox trainee priest dressed in a gray robe representing the sorrow, is completely different from the neat white cloak and vestment of the Protestant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The young people are the trainee priests of the Innovation Society. What they do here is what the young people in the trainee should do..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning sermon is over, young and innovative men and women priests are spreading along the street to the people and passers-by who come to visit, and walk towards the cafe with the noisy crowd. Come. Two or three people ran very fast, rushing into the cafe before the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We got a new missionary schedule! The day after tomorrow, the main church of Sefer arrived at the phase port and held a lecture on the principles of divine magic here! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?! Is this an invitation letter?! How many seminars can you get an invitation?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe try the door of the provincial capital? The main church of Correll is the second cathedral in this position second only to the Reformed Cathedral..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like an ice storm magic thrown into the water, the originally quiet cafe suddenly became confused. People walked around and talked, the new orders continued, and two or three waitresses were busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this chaos, a young revolutionary priest sat down on an empty chair opposite Ionette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Pastor, do you have someone sitting in this position?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I O'Neill took his eyes back from the distance and turned to the questioner. In Interlake, very few people can recognize his blue-and-white Orthodox priesthood, but the young trainee clerk accurately tells his rank. Ionite is very proud of his appearance, but even he has to admit that the man in front of the pure white summer priest is quite handsome, although his body is not tall, but there is an indescribable neutral. nice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person did not ask for his consent, but sat down and waved the nearest waitress to order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One cup of Ruhrock coffee." The trainee priest looked up and stared at the waitress with his dark green eyes, with a smirk pointing here. Alcoholic beverages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... leather, innovation will advocate the prohibition of alcohol! But we have substitute grape juice, how much weight do you want?" The glamour of the photo, the ordinary black-haired waitress blushes and gaze, even breathing is not smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, grape juice...free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man snapped a finger. A silver coin pops up. The silver coin flew a parabola in the air, and the waitress took a moment to scream and tried to pick it up, but still couldn't receive it. Silver coins were on her nails, flew to the table next to them, bounced back and rolled into the cafe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, sorry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nervous waitress apologized while running Into the house, and soon the reprimand of the foreman came from the store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trainee stunned his eyes and placed the single card left by the waitress in the middle of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There are a lot of newcomers to learn magic recently. Employment is not very expensive, and we can also provide some supplies as compensation for these peripheral employees—”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have already drawn the attention of others, Hartmann Cardinal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard that Ionite reacted violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a state--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘘. It makes people find it very troublesome. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man put his finger on his lips, revealing a pleasant smile, and defaulted to the opposite guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief bishop of men’s clothing, and the cardinal of the men’s dress, the two most powerful theocratic users of the phase port, under the noon umbrella Right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All others’ attention has been drawn away, leaving only two people – and there’s no name to listen to all of them in the near future. Waitress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Ruisi does not use magic, her own hearing is as good as an elf, but the appearance of the Orientals masks this power. If Bonnie Seifer now uses a higher level of detective magic eye, she could have found a magical fluctuation similar to her; but her magic is used to maintain the magic, no waste of magic to maintain that advanced The magic eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even with her ear power, only a few words can be heard. Ionite’s speech was very careful, and the voice was very low like a real nun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Actually, I didn't expect you to be in the phase port."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? Very unexpected Have you disrupted your arrangement? Would you like to send this card over and mess with my poor secretary's daily work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie speaks very lightly, But I can hear the cynicism. Ionite frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The impression you and I have before seems to be a little different. Bang..." Ionite slammed his tongue and did not say the other person’s name. In my impression, you seem to be a cautious, thoughtful and fearsome person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the "I am in my impression" When it comes to it, it sounds like the intimacy between men and women - he drove out the sudden distractions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it’s not 'I', right? Here is the trainee priest Baran Wei, who also has a vampire who is unfortunate enough to be a vampire. Every day, I’m trying to change my destiny. I want to change my destiny. It’s also fun to make character settings.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you really think this is fun? One..." Ionet feels that his beliefs seem to be insulted. He searches for the proper name in his mind. "The church pillars, like an actress, play other people? Is it necessary?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as it’s fun, I used to be cautious, thoughtful and awesome to protect everything I love, but I don’t need it now. So, as long as it’s fun, it’s enough. - The gods also agree with this idea." Bonnie Seifer, the men's clothing, replied, "Tell the right thing. Tell me the full text of your prophecy over there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette subconsciously swept a coffee shop. Everyone is busy with their own affairs. The members of the Archbishop's evangelistic club are busy arranging plans for admission tickets to major conferences. They don't know that their idols are sitting next to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The prophecy is like this: 'The golden road will be cut off, the dark sunset will light the sea'." Ionette paused, "although It's our prophetic technique, but the reliability is about..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reliability don't ask. Your prophecy, that is the fate of the goddess of the goddess At least, the probability of confidence is 80%.” Bonnie interrupted impatiently. “And, it is also in harmony with the current situation. We have built a golden road, and we all know what the dark sunset is.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ghost Fleet. The last time it has appeared until now, it’s almost fifty years old - they probably need to update the ship, but this is really not the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Isn't these employees yours?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But I don’t know who they’re paying, such as the security department, the trial court, or the fleet. Predicting magic Things, too many people know how it will affect the way of implementation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Occasionally, I also got a prophecy that complements your predictions." Nie Sefer pulled out a bamboo slip from the bag and pushed it along the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette picked up the bamboo slip and glanced at it, immediately said that the surrender had pushed back: "I can't read and write oriental characters, just barely understand." Please translate it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the strong is strong, the wood is strong; the golden jade is full, and it can be kept."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie caught the bamboo slips that were handed back from the opposite side, and read the words one word at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the two unrelated words from the holy book of Taipingzheng. Their holy book is equivalent to our covenant and agreement, but it is called The prophet personally recorded it. Translated into our language, the effect is this:"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her fingers crossed the surface of the bamboo slip. These sixteen square words are not written with ink, but are cut with a knife, or a sharp object like a knife, and then filled with a bright yellow color with a dye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The troops will be destroyed, the wood will be broken, and if the treasure is full of houses, there is no way to protect it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette made the judgment: "The soldiers and the wood are together, referring to the army made of wood...the fleet."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The house full of treasures refers to nothing more than the Green Cattle Palace or Phase Harbor. But if the prophecy on your side tells the same thing, then it is not by the sea. The Green Bull House can be removed from the list."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men dressed as men and men dressed as women looked at each other and reached a conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, the target of the attack is the phase port."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, ghost Why did the fleet attack the phase port? It is not possible to supplement their fleet. If we follow the prophecy and seal the narrow sea--" Bonnie Sefer holds the bamboo slip with the fingertips, picks up the volley, and makes a The action of smothering, "Would the Ghost Fleet not be stupid to such a degree?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unless someone forces them to come. If the death knell rings, the fleet will Must act."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The death knell rings..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie has indulged for a moment, it seems Trying to think back to relevant knowledge. Her fingers trembled quickly, seemingly tapping something, and the magic net also reacted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'The death knell'? Good old vocabulary... Does this thing still exist now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Ionite asked strangely the beautiful man in front of him: "Of course there is still? As long as the reign of the elf empire is still there, the curse of the great wilderness will not disappear."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This year is...and there are still a few years." Bonnie muttered a word that she could understand only, and took a sip of the coffee cup. "That is, our opponent is already Full control of a 'cancellation' person. The ghost fleet with unlimited endurance is probably hiding somewhere in the boundless sea. It seems a bit interesting... the top caster who has and can control the death knell. Or , the top caster controlled by the death knell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please also don't care. I will arrange for my Highness to leave the Port of Hong Kong in recent days, but I myself and My team will help you defend here. After all, the Ghost Fleet has damaged both of us. . Interest "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; this could have been talking to here should be over. The two sides exchanged prophecies, made judgments, and relayed to their allies...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Ionite hesitated, or raised the last question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coffee cup tray in Bonnie's hand shook a bit, and a few drops of coffee sprinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the prophecy of magic is not valid for her. Because she and her sister are variables outside the expectations of the goddess of fate, they cannot be found through prophetic magic. She knows the reason but doesn't want to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Bonnie decided to change her answer and open the question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We don't have such a reliable prophecy of magic, the goddess of the goddess of fate, Fatila. By the way, I don't think that your suspicions with the empire have been cleared. At least one person holding a death knell is in the Royal Security Department."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionite stunned: "I? No, you made a mistake." What? I am not an elector.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well, yes—you are not a voter?” This answer is completely different from the knowledge in Bonnie’s memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that I can, but unfortunately, each god can only have one voter in the world."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette smiled bitterly, and found a few silver coins on the table, ready to get up and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, on this issue, I also believe that the Royal Security Department is not involved - although I don't know if they have a death knell in their hands. You may not know it for the time being, but it is not a secret to the top of the two churches: the current electorate of the goddess of fate, Futila, has been in the Royal Security Department, and this prophecy is what she specifically sent to me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow wow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie sat in her seat and didn't get up for a long time. The last sentence brought her more information than even those before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is the current voter? Why have I never heard of it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;After a moment, she placed the coffee cup heavily on the table and walked out in the opposite direction to the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one noticed these two people, except for a few young trainee mages who worked in cafes and chatted a few words while counting accounts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, is the handsome priest in the field being smashed by our boss? I think the boss is buying a ticket for him."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I guess it may be a failure, then I know the real sex of the boss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White sister, don't be like this, I can't breathe easily!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Ruisi chats with temporary colleagues while tidying up his current record tasks into short texts and taking time out Deposited in the secret room of the store as an archive submitted to the Royal Security Department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there is no secret conversation between Ionet and Bonnie; in theory, Bai Ruisi does not know this. In fact, her vision and hearing are comparable to the best elves, even if they are separated by a wall or busy ordering and wiping the table, they will listen to the conversation over there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, Bai Ruisi will tell her that two of her sisters are about to be attacked. She speculated that after this secret talk, there will probably be several other pieces of information sent to the Yanqu, the Intreton, and the Seventh Fleet. There should also be an intelligence through the Green Bull House. Turned to her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, this list should be no problem - but Bai Ruisi still feels a faint worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instinct to struggle for survival at the bottom of the phase port tells her that something is wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I always feel that the two of them seem to have missed something..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the evening of the day, when When she saw the black falling sunrise over the Westport, she wondered what the great things of the two churches had missed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This omission is so obvious that the two highly skilled priests did not realize it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
