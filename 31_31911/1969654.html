			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 29, 1666, the capital of the Republic of Turk, Keng Le suburbs<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Empire has the world’s first magical power. This fact, Nika has recognized many times, but every time there will be updated facts to let her realize this. This time she was shocked by the town in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are the aristocrats of these ** doing?" The princess at the top of the aristocratic pyramid was very untimely talking to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before she thought that the military would decorate the largest building here as a dance venue, but this is not the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is... they spent a afternoon building a new palace in the center of the town. She couldn't imagine that this place was still a battlefield made up of broken walls a few hours ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a real palace with a luxurious ivory white. The building occupies the entire city's civic plaza, with twenty-four Coman-style columns supporting its ceiling, each of which is taller than the church spire. The decorations above are almost all real reliefs, and they don't look like the perfunctory things that the magicians have made. She curiously touched it and found that it was all really hardened opal. These stones are uneven in texture and beautiful in texture. They are not like the ones that are freely processed with morphing magic. The author even made the name of the palace "phantom temple" and the builder's nameplate in the corner. She approached the famous brand and looked at the signature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Director Ionet; Hartman..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, you Call me?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall figure appeared ghostly behind her, and she was scared back two steps. It was a young man with a long white hair and handsome enough to describe it as "beautiful", more than a head higher than her. He wore a silver military uniform from the Guards, a silver-white sword at his waist, and a badge consisting of a church star and a skull on his chest and arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 couldn’t recognize what the badge was, but fortunately the man quickly introduced himself: “I am the deputy director of magic engineering, Ionet. Cardinal Hartmann, who was transferred here because of the disastrous defeat of Steelburg.” His smile was a bit ridiculous. “Do you like this palace?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, I like it very much..." Renee suddenly reacted. "You said that you are... Cardinal?! One of the twelve cardinals?! Deputy Director of Engineering?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why does everyone ask this question?" The white-haired man grabbed the back of his head. "Well, the Secretary of Security proposed, it’s a punishment...." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinica realized that he had asked the wrong question and hurriedly opened the topic: "This is really a huge project. How many people have been used?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not as much as you think. Most of the components of this phantom hall are fixed with reduced magic or fixed magic. The main body of the components are in different spaces, and there is not much labor required. The Guards attacked the town and its surrounding areas and invested more than 10,000 people. They came to help after the battle ended."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to build this palace, this person concentrated more than 10,000 Guards in this town? And they have completed this huge project while repelling the enemy in the town! Somehow, Seneca suddenly felt a deep sense of guilt. One of her suggestions can change the fate of thousands of people just because she is "Olivia; Hugh; Coman." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A great power attached to the bloodline..." There was a strange feeling in her heart that she was not used to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Io. Interested in our first princess? So you will disappoint your majesty and be expelled from the church. You are the youngest in the history of the Holy See. The cardinal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Xiu Lan came and I was busy closing my mouth. For the first time, she saw this frivolous guy with a combat sword: it was a strange sword that was said to be a one-handed sword but too long, saying that the two-handed sword was too narrow. If you want to describe it, it is like expanding the ordinary sword by five times and increasing the length by one and a half times. The wooden scabbard is round like a sword and is wrapped in black leather. It can faintly see the silver light shining through the sheath under the leather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionite shrugged: "Reassured, there is absolutely nothing wrong. Right, Princess Royal knows this plan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xu Lan smiled: "Of course It is said that this plan is what she proposed. Tonight, the Freedom Army will invest all the reserve teams."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Addition to the second division of the super-editor's Lei', more than 20,000 of the best mercenaries. They also have 30,000 to 50,000 local troops to maintain the line of defense, but only this unit is the real main force. Of course, they also know that our Guards are here. "The cardinal took a fine sword at the waist. "No matter how many hours of their night attack, we will wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. No matter how many hours there are." In the past few days, I have observed the repairing of the frontline and the continuous tug-of-war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛nica understands what they are talking about. The luxurious palace around her is brightly lit, and not far away is the country farmland and endless darkness. The last touch of the setting sun has just passed away, leaving only the brilliant magical light shining on the earth. In the darkness not far away, there may be countless Free Army soldiers making the final preparations before the attack...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waltz sounded. She shook her head and walked into the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road leading to the inner hall is like a labyrinth. The entrants have to go through various warning lines from "detecting weapons" to "detecting magical reactions", at least six strong defensive magic embellishment, each entrance has a class of silver-mounted guards. At first, I didn't mean to let them lead the way, but when she passed the same intersection for the fourth time, finally some knights couldn't hold back. The two guards took the initiative to lead her humbly to the main hall, the social field of the nobles - or the hunting ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf consisting of colored candies flies around the hall, carved into a huge statue of dragons, phoenixes and unicorns. The dance hall is divided into several areas, the length of the corner The table is full of rare dishes that he can't name. Countless maids and waiters are shuttled through the crowd. These people are also dressed neatly, and most of them can even see a faint enchantment glow. Unlike the open-air banquets of Lenny's luxury merchants, 黛nica can tell at a glance that these people are not even mixed with an activation or phantom waiter. The three bands are scattered around the wide hall, playing marches, waltzes and deram dances. Their tunes are sometimes intertwined with each other, and sometimes they are fighting, and there is no magic enhancement with magical magic. This ostentation may not be as fascinating as the Ronnie's glory, but it is extravagant in simplicity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The aristocrats of these **." Seneca suddenly realized that the real luxury is not to use all the magic, but almost no magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing luxurious noble girls shuttle between the plaques, use the elegant movements to use the meal, and from time to time talk with the strangers around, whenever the dance When I heard it, I danced with a nearby man. The Gustav emperor had already sat on the ad hoc throne, watching the singer-song dance below, still with a majestic expression on his face, and Sid, who had the same face around him; Nasser was in contrast. She was about to greet her, and suddenly someone pulled her crimson silk gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When it’s hard to come, enjoy it all, Your Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮It took a moment to recognize the person. In Frasol; after the priest Rasta removed the empire's mission, she never saw him again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today's Rasta is not wearing armor, nor a sword, but wearing a black military dress. Now, Nika knows his identity: he is the illegitimate son of the Duke of Fingota, the military minister. When the two heirs of the Duke led the army in the Eastern Front, he followed the Duke and guarded him. Of course, he is also one of the few people who know the true identity of Yanika. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's bothering you." 黛妮卡 cleverly followed his dance steps and learned the movements of a lady. "It's much easier than magic gestures." ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "啪" whispered, the Viscount's face muscles tightened. Yanika looked red and hurriedly shifted the topic: "What about your father?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On the other side, more than a dozen ladies were invited today. His blade can still be far from rusting." Rasta, who was stepped on, smiled a bit. "Old bastard. Today, this dance can be held thanks to your proposal. Thanks to my colleagues. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black is the Second Army, and Silver is the Guard." Rasta squeezed his eyes. "This foot is lighter than the one just now, and His Highness is progressing very fast."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, sorry... why don't they invite people to dance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Evening dresses are too expensive, for some people Said the military dress is cheaper." Rasta, who also wore a military dress, replied, "I have a set, but did not bring it as a secret agent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Actually Is it because you have placed yourself on the side of the civilian-born officer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rasta looked away, "Your technology is progressing very fast, Your Highness." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Memory is my virtue..." Renee is coping, the music at the end of the dance is suddenly turning, her shoes are slamming for the third time. The other's feet. "...I'm sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, this is the end. The next dance step will be half a quick shot, Your Highness." Rasta let go of her hand. , bent back and smiled and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Renee realized that she had been slow and half-shot, and her face was red to the ear. The ladies around me gave a laugh, and the men showed a "good faith" smile; she didn't want to stay on the dance floor again, and quickly walked to the table at the side, using food to make herself a young aristocrat with the bee colony. Isolation. During this time, the emperor only occasionally chatted with several ministers around him, and occasionally turned his head to look at the big clock in the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hour passed quickly. She frowned, looking into the corners of a group of civilian officers, and looked at the Chinese costume aristocrats dancing in the field, holding their lips and shaking their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of her is getting stronger and stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I have the luck to ask you to dance a dance, Your Highness?" A nobleman approached her who had just put down the tray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, not now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 opened the side and was overwhelmed The nobles strode to the group of soldiers and took a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You intend to keep eating barbecue in the corner until the end of the dance, you?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness!" Rasta took the lead on one knee, and the surrounding officers saw them follow suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t plan to dance down? Today, this dance is hosted by the officers. It’s obvious that everyone is fighting hard, are you willing to watch? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civilian officers stood up, look at me, I look at you, no one moves. The attention of the entire venue was attracted by Jenny, and even Gustav stood up from the throne. The dance was suddenly silent, and even the band stopped and looked at the little Yuxing show that took place in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 feels a little nervous, but does not regret it. In fact, even she did not understand why she had to do this - there seems to be a force that provokes the most secretive impulse in her heart. The instinct of "just" is owned by people who grow up under the umbrella of Freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, Your Highness... Are you misunderstood?" Rasta approached her, whispering, "actually, all the men present. It’s all officers, not only we are.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“All? Include those, those who still have those?!” Renee pointed to those who wore them. Aristocrats like the military and like a playboy, opened their mouths in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rasta’s voice is even lower. "These people you are talking about are almost all the commanding officers or magic officers of the frontline troops. They will charge the front of the team and bear the next defense and counterattack missions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 is silent, and I don’t know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this silence, the person who stood up and solved the problem was a person she could never think of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security Minister Sid; Naser stood out from the shadow behind the emperor and took her gloved hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If your Highness wants to dance with an officer, let me represent it. After all, you can't dance with everyone, here is So many beautiful ladies. I suggest that the next song will be dedicated to the soldiers who are fighting for blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...thank you, thank you. "The alarm bell in the heart of Yanika is loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people she knows are almost always there...this is obviously arranged by someone. Apart from the Security Minister, it is almost impossible for others to have this ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the band chose a fast dance music with a strong ethnic style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpected by Jenny, Sid’s dance jumped quite well, even consciously or unintentionally guiding her who was not very skilled in fast dance. This indifferent man's dance and dance teaching standards are not at all in Rasta, and even more so - the evidence is that no matter how hard he works, he can't step on his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your dance is quite good, Your Highness. It’s better than before you travel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Where, I am almost the worst of the people here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is a young and outstanding man, the compliment of this person in front of him is completely impossible People are happy. In the same way, speaking in other populations can make Janica feel a little vanity, but in this population she can only make her cold sweat soak the shoulder strap of the evening dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But for the officers present, the dancing of the ladies is wonderful, not as good as your Royal Highness. You have mastered the most beautiful dance. Method, Your Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this person constantly complimenting her? Why did he take the initiative to invite dance? Does he know her true identity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are too prized, Naserqing. I am used to the rough south, it is difficult to compare with the northern ladies."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seneca tried to continue her own dance, but Sid took hold of her arm, blocked her own awkward struggle and led her to make a beautiful week. Half-turned. The action looked like it was made by Renee, and the surrounding ladies were a little surprised and put away the contempt in the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s been too long for you to leave the court. It may be strange to everything here. If there is anything that can help you, please be sure to tell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does he want to do? Who is this promise to Olympus, or to Renee's own? She didn't know how to react, she could only answer: "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Side has an inscrutable smile on his face. "Try to stay farther from the front line. Your proposal is too dangerous today. The enemy is not only on the opposite side, but more likely to be among us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be for him As the commentary, when the music reached the highest point, a harsh treble came from outside the palace -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the sound of the charge and the high-pitched arrow . The charge marks the main assembly position of the Free Army, and the high-pitched arrows guide their direction. Above all this is the harsh noise from the shells and meteorites rubbing against the atmosphere! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cannons? How many shells can they penetrate the defense here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Guard Knight was ridiculed, but his ridicule was frozen in the eyes of the blind man. The fragments of the tiles fluttered in the air, the ground shook, the chandeliers swayed, and the flame of the candle was now extinguished. The radiance of defensive magic became red, fragile and flickered, and seemed to collapse at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor’s face became iron blue. In the tug-of-war of more than a week ago, the Freedom Army did not use any heavy artillery at all, and the night attack was also a real "night attack." If all this is to create a psychological set-up of "the Central Army lacks heavy artillery," they have done very well. Or, this is only because they have transferred heavy artillery by some means...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Non-combatants leave here! Officers, keep me here, wait The reinforcements are overwritten..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please feel at ease, Your Highness." Sid; Nasser's rare smile expression attracted all the attention of Reneka. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw him shaking his wrist and the corner of the palace ceiling exploded. Half of the ceiling was smashed, revealing the sky in the night and the moonlight falling down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not the moonlight, it is the radiance of the rainbow, these rays will illuminate the night sky as white. Thousands of shells are flying, and colorful magical traces guide them, a signal used by artillery observers to correct ballistics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey. I am wrong again." Yanika suddenly felt that her strength was so small in front of this scene, and the blood on her face faded. The ladies and ladies have already screamed in full - the Freedom's magical combat power is not weaker than the Emperor, they just use it very rarely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please rest assured, Your Highness, you are right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strong arm holds On the waist of Yanika, she lifted her up. She felt the power of some kind of magic, which made her body float like a skylark in the air and unfolded into a beautiful curve of bow. The girl’s gaze just stayed on the meteorological group of falling stars, only listening to the whistling sound of their falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonica didn’t scream or cry, but calmly began to whisper a defensive spell with her arms pointing to the sky. A violent explosion sounded, accompanied by a yellow dust. In this loud noise that is enough to cause deafness, only one voice penetrates all the noise and whispers in her ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The meaning of our existence is to guarantee the order, peace and security of the Coleman family. As long as you are willing to accept my help, the entire Royal Security Department will be on call. The secret is always a secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this sudden shelling, Sid; Naser suddenly issued a declaration of loyalty to her. She knows she has only one option - the Royal Security Department will guarantee her safety in all aspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete." She habitually replied with Lenny, "This is a good deal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; When she said this, the shell that had hit her was gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Security gently put her down, and she discovered that no shells actually fell on those cashmere carpets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty. No one needs to leave, this is the safest place." Sid let go of Reneka’s hand and walk to the throne to the emperor. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor stayed. "What the hell is going on, Nasser?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although you have to fool the enemy, you must first fool yourself, but this time no one deceives. His Majesty. Is the name of this palace not a 'phantom'? The place we are standing is not inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid explained, looking at the big stride Ionite and Xiu Lan entered the scene with some appreciation in their eyes. The emperor suddenly understood that these guys are all colluding well. He simply stopped talking and wanted to see what the ministers had arranged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, we don't expect the enemy to attack this town. We just want to have their artillery units. We are the one responsible for this task." The army." A repaired Shulan walked to the middle of the venue, Shen Sheng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the defensive magic that you passed before, one of them was the transfer of magic. The core of the palace is actually located five kilometers west of the town, and it is removed. The second army officer was built. The one left in the town is actually just a shell.” Io’s expression is leisurely. “The interior part of the building is not there. The bomb just exploded in five kilometers. Beyond, the sway here is just the illusion that illusion magic gives us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal waved and dispelled the illusion. The remaining ceilings were suddenly removed, revealing the true colors of the stars. It was a cold, thorough, flawless transparent ceiling, and even the wind blew from the top. This is a palace that can hear the sound of guns, can hear the sound of killing, but can't see blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the responsibility of our courtiers to share our worries and avoid being in danger. Sorry without pre-notification, but to deceive the enemy, I lied to myself first. Please order it, kneel!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean... I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gustav showed his expression of appreciation and looked up. The light of the moon and the stars cast on his face, and the color of all things is a holy cold color, like the oil painting depicting saints and voters in the church. He held up the scepter in his hand and the band spontaneously pulled up the tone of the national anthem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is now. Offensive, everyone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief Guard Knight walks to the wall While picking up his own sword, the Cardinal raised his hand and made a magical array of faintly visible in the air, modifying the correspondence between the transmission points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the officers of the Guards, stand upright! We are the reserve team of the General Reserve, the elite in the elite!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiu Lan screamed. His voice was so loud that he even overshadowed the shelling outside the house. The people in evening gowns and military gowns were all serious and straight, and they pressed their chests to pay attention to the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our goal is the opponent's main artillery position and command! Go to the most vulnerable part of the enemy, advance!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow!" All the officers rushed out and disappeared into the transmission array outside each door according to the instructions of Master Oo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senikan can guess what these people are going to do. For many of them, this may be the last meal; they will rush to death with memories of this meal and the last dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked up and stared at the sky. Those who died under the guns were in two different worlds with the people who commanded them, and the people who commanded them and the people who remained in the palace were in two different worlds. The gap between the world and the world cannot be smoothed out by outstanding performance and just words, nor can it disappear because of the excellent and heroic model nobles. No, the problem is not what the nobility is, but...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly understands the real reason she did before - she was not used to it. Those nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What she does not understand is the hierarchy itself, and the indifference to the hierarchy. Only the military will put inequality in the most obvious way: the generals and officers are different, the officers and the officers are different, the officers and soldiers are different, and their value difference is directly reflected in the chance of survival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that she has the same injustice in her country, even more than ever. She knows that the superiors of her country are not necessarily better than these nobles, but...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what kind of organization they are in, no matter what country they are in, She has never been able to accept this indifference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hate this kind of thing." She told herself gently. Only this is beyond doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She approached the excited emperor and gently held his arm. No one noticed that her fists were so tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We should be happy that we have the bravest soldiers and the best generals. Yours is the soul of our empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as we defeat the main force of the Central Army here, we can hold a dance in Lenny in a month. We can do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the promises made by the emperor, Seneca glanced at Gustav coldly: "I don’t know what it is called a lesson? I have already paid so many young people’s lives, this is not enough. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before the enemy fell, we had to pay them. The long tug-of-war must end, our elite soldiers can't mobilize with the South. The soldiers are consumed together here. You should know that their sacrifice is meaningful and glorious." Gustav is not talking to her, but talking to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Renee has already known that under the mask full of self-confidence is actually a mysterious fear. Because of fear, he will stand here with his own life and talents. She smiled a bit and gave up her intention to convince the emperor. The empire is no better than her motherland, but...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of gunshots and explosions never stopped, and the sounds just drifted away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May+26, April 30, 1666, the Quaker Capital Kegler<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp On the eighth day of the Kengala battle, Princess Olia was woken up by the Morning Light of the Communications Corps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, our forward forces directly attacked Kengler. Kengler did not have a free army stationed, and even the self-police team ran well. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The positive Freedom Army withdrew thirty kilometers after night under the command of Hull. Not only did they lose the front line command and artillery positions, they even gave up Kengler, and they seemed to have to withdraw to Lennie all the way. The Guards are triumphant and will certainly not have a chance to rest before today's twilight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The source of the other’s heavy artillery was answered. The great power artillery they had seized outside the town was Kengal’s city defense. I do not know when the Free Army evacuated all the equipment, supplies, troops and population in the capital. After a month of mixed battles, the city’s population was full of only one-fifth of the total, and the emperor received almost an empty city. Such an empty city can be said to be of no benefit to logistics. The rest are the poorest poor and can only provide very limited taxes and supplies. Let this ancient capital re-rule the entire Juroc, at least this summer is very difficult to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But victory is victory. The main force and the general reserve team that the Central Army is proud of have been hit hard, and it is obvious that the counterattack cannot be launched again in the short term. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no supply for the Steelburg Army. They have enough food, but the ammunition and materials are not just stocks." The Duke of Gota glared at the white beard. "When can the Fourth Army go south from Newcastle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A staff member answered: "Exactly, just new The fourth army of the fort sent an urgent message by sending the magician. They said... they said..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor raised his eyebrows, "What do they say? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They said..." The adviser replied in a hurry. "The republic of the Republic of Steelburg went north, and the Fourth Army frustrated in the battle." , has retreated to Newcastle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news like a blue sky swept through the headquarters that is celebrating the victory. The staff member who was placing the flag on the sand table lost his hand and flattened a city, a silent silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small setbacks! They dare to give up the Oswego natural danger? They are behind the entire Coman alluvial plain! How much loss?!" Gus Taff couldn't control himself, and he used his scepter to point to the staff member who sent the bad news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He, they didn't say, squat. The detailed loss should arrive with the supply team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Please anger, kneel down." Security Minister Sid's lips shook with incomprehensibility, "Pluto; Luther... The Fourth Army couldn't stop the man, it was reasonable. After all, they There are more than 30,000 troops on hand, including the infamous first division. The pressure on the Fourth Army is too great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor stared at the map , pulled up the flag nailed to the enemy capital DeLand. "Do you want to use the general reserve team?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is to be used, but not for the Fourth Army." Sid took the flag and inserted it on the east line. On the territory of the Republic of the Fascist, "give to Karen; von; Figota, the Fergota army needs reinforcements. This is not a good thing for the Minister of Military Affairs, for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First defeat the East Line?" The emperor nodded. "You are right, Naserqing. Down the west bank of the edge of the river, defeating Wiener; Betsy's main force." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for grace." The Duke of Figota gratefully glanced at the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But another staff member raised an objection: "What about the general reserve team going to the east line? What about Fort Steel and Gustav Fort?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those who have lost their supplies have no chance! We have already defeated the second division, we are about to fight the first division and the fourth division. In any case, we are impossible Looking back." Gustav's voice was soaked in firmness. His confidence has infected everyone around him. "We are going to Lenny! There is no difficulty to stop us! Our victory is there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
