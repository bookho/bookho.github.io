In general, people use this term to describe all struggles about power and rights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word is published in two sources: one is "individual" and the other is "country." From these two sources, two words that refer to the same profession are derived. Those who engage in politics for personal gain are called "politicians." Those who engage in politics for the sake of national interests are called "politicians." More often, the two are inextricably linked and together constitute the blood and flesh of the greatest and most filthy cause of "politics." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing that is the oldest profession - even more than a "farmer", "businessman", "priest" and "magician". That is the most prominent profession - they have taken up 80% of the history books. That is the most common profession - this is probably the only occupation that will emerge in all civilizations. In different civilizations, they are called "chiefs", "craters", "nobles", "bishops", "public servants"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the republics of the Union, the second largest country in the civilized world, they are called "parliamentarians" or "public opinion spokespersons." The United Parliament has 180 seats in theory, but only 127 members are currently performing their duties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of this month’s continuous disaster has made the highest authority in the Republic crumbling. The first is the coup d'état at the beginning of the month, which is a spearhead of the fundamental policy of the ruling party to "support the southern economy." What is even more terrible is that in this chaos, there has been a huge scandal of undead members who control the parliamentary vote! Although the coup army was eventually repelled, the parliament became a laughing stock of the republics and empires. Concord even took the opportunity to turn the dissatisfaction with the current political power into the motive force of the independent government with the support of the political transformation army. Almost all of the Ruhrlocks have withdrawn from the joint parliament. The commander of the southwestern army, once called high-ranking, Klad Lopez, has long been inactive, letting the coups in Fort Vatican go unpunished...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;released, all this All will be marked with a period. Just this morning, almost all the Republican congressmen got the top secret news through different channels, and understood the reason why the former French army commander Wiener Betsy called an emergency meeting. Even people who cannot get this kind of news should not be qualified to represent at least 100,000 citizens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published "Fottle Fortress fell on last night. Former Freedom Marshal Radz Govar was captured at Fort Worth this morning at 0:00."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published like this, on the 25th of December, which was classified as a statutory rest day, the huge stables of the Supreme Court were taken by lawmakers from 7:00 in the morning. The horse is full. The crowded square in front of the court is not inferior to the parking lot in the same location in the later generations, and even has it. The Mafu and Jiuliu Masters who work here are struggling to control all the horses, horses and horse manure, and prevent these secular objects from interfering with the sacred trials in the courtroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three judges were sitting in the middle of the court, one of the highest officials, one reformist, and one conservative. Soldiers and politicians are confidently sitting in the spokesperson's position, and their legal counsel is cautiously hiding in the assistant's seat. If there is any difference between the courts of this era and the courts of later generations, it is that everyone who thinks they have culture believes that they can understand the complicated legal provisions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published "There has been no such great trial for a long time. How long do you think treason can be debated?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "I guess this will be a protracted debate. After all, it involves politics. Was the last treason not a trial for nearly a year?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members who rushed to different political dinners last night talked energetically, waiting for the arrival of the official victory message; and the arrival of the military’s retired Marshal and the retired Marshal of Fox The chill in the field is more heated. All this discussion has been maintained until the black carriage stops in the middle of the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release guards listed neat formations and formed a passage to the Supreme Court. The two passengers above the carriage followed the wall and headed for the entrance to the Supreme Court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "General Lopez to! Radz Govar!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish the whole The court immediately calmed down and could only hear the neat footsteps of the army. The soldiers in the blue military uniforms and the marshals in the indigo military uniforms guarded every possible defense point. The military mages carrying various types of detection equipment were busy detecting the surroundings. The guards in the green military uniforms were immediately This blue ocean is submerged. Under the gaze of all eyes, Gowar went to the opposite dock without hesitation; Klad strode to the prosecution and sat down next to Conti Fox's retired marshal. After the judge used the raft to signal the silence of the audience, he took the lead to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release said that he stayed for a moment and asked everyone for their opinions. After Conti, Wiener and the grand jury agreed, he continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published "According to the Free Army Code, we made the following allegations against the former Free Marshal and the Chairman of the Joint Staff Conference, Mr. Radz Govar: he was suspected of causing troops Unrest, unauthorized movement of troops, unauthorized use of force against innocent civilians..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish everyone waiting for him to say the allegation. The allegation that is bound to occur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "...the above three. We hope that the faculty members will give a fair trial, and the grand jury can make a fair ruling. May the Lesotho cross The sword is with justice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summary is like throwing a cold glass in a boiling oil pan. If there is no provision for "the jury can't make any interference in the trial of the case", I am afraid that someone will stand up from the position and directly question Clade. Someone even stood up, but remembered that it was not a joint parliament and sat back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no crime of treason? ! Collecting heavy troops, armed subversive government - such crimes do not accuse the treason? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of the highest ** officer looks quite surprised: "Hey...just these accusations? Lord Fox, Lord Betsy, what else to add?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release has not waited for Bezi to react, and Conti Fox answered the question: "No. Please ask the defendant."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published to hear such a reply, the long-tested and highest-ranking official has not recovered. Almost all the drafts he prepared were overturned by the current situation, but another one of the officers continued to try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Oh... then we ask the accused. Will the accused admit these accusations?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The release of Radz looked at the jury and replied without hesitation: "I confess that I committed these crimes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published In addition to a glass of cold water, the Supreme Court's oil pan added a stone. This time, people couldn't stand it anymore and began to shout loudly. The judge on the right side knocked on the table more than ten times to stop them. Who has seen the accused who pleaded guilty in five minutes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "You mean...you plead guilty, Mr. Govar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish this name The judge carefully confirmed it again. As a judge for many years, he has not seen the trial of the former defendant’s consensus so quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Yes, I plead guilty." The former marshal replied calmly, "I don't intend to justify these crimes..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words that posted him were interrupted when they were not finished. A voice slammed in and overwhelmed everything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Wait a minute!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of "The Flame General" Betsy finally reacted. Because of anger and shock, his face has completely turned red. He understands that if he does not stop this trial, the trump card in his hand will be completely invalidated. It only takes an hour...and he can wait for the witnesses he needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published his clearing of the dice and spoke in a loud voice: "I doubt Mr. Govar’s guilty plea, it is likely that some of the charges are not his The trial is for justice, not for narrow sense of accountability or revenge. We cannot let a sinner, but we cannot marry a good person. We have good reason to believe that the riots caused by the troops and the mobilization of troops without permission are The allegations are not all the responsibility of the defendant..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the stone, the iron that was thrown into the pan. The oil pans in the auditorium and the jury were completely blown up, and everyone was talking about it. If the trial that was resolved within ten minutes is occasionally seen, then the scene in which the prosecution defended the defendant has never been seen. In the nearly one hundred years of history in a free country, there has never been such a chaotic trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "God... This trial is amazing. It will definitely go down in history."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Release<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish Anne's cramped and tight legs, hands on his knees, carefully sitting on the edge of the stool, like a lady, not squinting, with the corner of his eyes Yu Guang looked around. She is very uncomfortable now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published as a true great magician, she can easily count how many children are curious about the eyes around. At least fourteen people are peeping, every window, every wall hole. On the table in front of it is a dessert that is too extravagant for the welfare home: real chocolate, spheroidal yogurt such as empire, and even the newly-produced "spreader drink" that is good for magic supplements - This fraudulent marketing tool is of course her own pure gold consortium investment. Such a generous hospitality made Anne feel that it was a waste to donate to me here. But with this purely eye-catching offensive, she had to try to keep a little bit of restraint on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Sordenton, do you think this welcome is too grand? You are nothing, why not even me... not yet. Is it so curious?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;released “because they like military uniforms?” Soledon guessed, but then denied, “No, these guys look at Clade’s The Guards are all used to it, it is impossible..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published "And, what did the nuns and Mr. Fran go to? It’s how to change clothes, how long Don't come back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "I think it's probably preparing food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish The two only talked for these two sentences and re-entered the cold state. It is also difficult to find a common topic in terms of their impression of each other. Fortunately, the voice of the nun was quickly transmitted from outside the house, breaking the deadlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Don't watch, everyone is gone? You see, you don't dare to talk to your brother and sister. Go play, hehe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a release at the door, which was dressed in formal to the scalp scalp of Wei Lun and Zalt. The mage wears the most formal expensive black suit, while the nuns only have a robes worn by the female priests during the holiday season. They seem to be going to attend the state banquet instead of preparing home-cooked food here, and dressing up is completely inconsistent with the simple surroundings. This dress immediately put Anne and Soledon in the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published "Ms. Sefer." Zalt spoke seriously first - even the title became officially formal, "can make my family not Does Soledon tell us about what happened during your stay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Good, good. That...you want to say from 黛妮卡It’s ...... ah, no, let’s start with my identity.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blond girl’s forehead began to produce fine sweat. She is not good at lying, and is not good at improvising fictional stories—especially when the air is filled with an intangible element called “duffle”. She couldn't figure out where this dignity came from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two people who have been looking at her in the face of an interviewer like this? This reminds her of the days when I was looking for a job after graduating from high school in another era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "I am the reserve lieutenant of the Intercontinental Army. You should also know it? The General Reserve, the Intercontinental, the Second Division, where I am That... the intelligence department took office. It was about two weeks ago, that is, one week after the end of the matter, I went for some of the company’s business... Kenkel’s glance.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of tension made her words sound a bit confusing. Soledon hurriedly added: "It is a pure gold consortium. Miss Sefer is responsible for the liaison officer's task. After all, this consortium has a very strong military background. Because of the blockade, we met in a small town on the way. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published "Well. Because of the commission of General Lopez, we decided to go to Fort Vatican. Just two days before arriving in Fort Vatican, we will I met the last night's conference! In that battle, Soleton performed well and set a great credit for the first effort! So Clade decided to give him the lieutenant rank..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to Anne’s preface, I didn’t even talk about it, or even missed a big piece of important content. Sorelton hurriedly licked her with her finger and took over the topic. Start adding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing here, Wei Lun and Zalt looked at each other. Zalt cleared his throat and continued to ask: "So, are you on vacation now? When will you return to the team?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Ah, no big recent The war is over, I am not returning to the team for a while..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;released "Soleton, he was greatly stimulated after watching the blood of the battlefield and decided to retire..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The announcement said that the two men slammed back and stopped. The atmosphere in the room suddenly became very embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Enough, Zach. You ask the question so formal, the girls are reacting too quickly!" The nun slammed the gentleman around him. The man stood elbows, stood up and pulled Annie's arm. "Go, let's get some food. The baked berry biscuits that I baked should be baked soon. Let's try it first?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Wait, wait a minute..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing girls from the future struggling, but still being dragged out room. She was not so easy to be taken away, but she is now sitting as a lady, without any resistance to external strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Don't look at me as a nun, my sweets are doing a good job. Others dare not say that biscuits were the best in the entire year of the seminary. Ok."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published on the way to the kitchen, Wei Lun moved to the topic. Sure enough, this topic succeeded in attracting Anne's interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The famous post-lifetime food scientist, Reese Quirahiya, said when reviewing the food of this era: "Food? Before entering the industrial era Can it be called food?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not bragging to release her – no one can look down on a man’s ten years of life and single life The cooking level of gourmets for ten years. In the world two hundred and fifty years later, there are at least three culinary contest medals in her cabinet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Is it a meringue berry biscuit? It sounds good, but I don't know if you pay attention to wheat flour, nuns? Good gluten and good elasticity." Flour is not good for meringue biscuits. Of course, the most important thing is baking technology. Can you accurately grasp the temperature and time of the nun? If you want to say it, you should not leave it for so long..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The announcement of Anne’s speech as if it were a challenge, the nun’s fighting spirit also burned up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Oh? You are so old, I am afraid that the biscuits I have eaten have not been baked much! How do you want to try it, Sefi Miss Grand? I rely on chefs and theoretical books all the time, but I don’t know how to bake good biscuits.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Annie smiled confidently: “I’m not really Missy. I will do the things that slaves will do. After all, I haven’t received any service from birth until now! But if the cookies are too good to hurt the nun’s self-esteem, it’s not good, right. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Oh? I don't dare to say anything in my kitchen. Different kinds of flour and butter are quite a bit. Then please start, stuff Miss Fair."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of Wei Lun said to open the thick wooden door of the kitchen. Annie walked up high and looked at everything with her gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of "health is quite good, the various necessities are quite complete. But I still have a question, where is the electric oven, gas and faucet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published to hear these unintelligible words, the nun stopped. "Ah? What are you talking about? Is it a foreign seasoning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "I said electricity..." Anne reacted and hurriedly changed her mouth. "I said roast. Furnace... Difficult, is this the big thing that burns coal below?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Yes. I am sorry, our welfare home is not financially good, burning I can't afford charcoal and firewood, I have to use coal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "coal..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
