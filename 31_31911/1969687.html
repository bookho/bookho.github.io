Its emperor is merely a display, and its prime minister rules the world proudly through a bureaucratic class with full administrative and magical training. The cost of this peace is high and unstable. One day, all civilized nations will be armed to march into it, and even its colonies will rise up against its rule."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future of Anne Seifer, an 18th-century Farius thinker has argued this. Although it seemed to be a bit of a sloppy dog ​​at the time, it was all verified in the mainland war a hundred years later. The sacred Coman Empire fought against the entire civilized world and was smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this evening, the empire looks quite sacred. The staff sent the troops out in the same way, breaking up every reorganization of the Free Army. Everyone feels that they have been sheltered by the gods. Soldiers and officers are rowing prayer stars on their chests before they leave, hoping that the attack will go smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s like Kengaler twenty years ago, but the position is reversed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The siege war is like this. When there is a wall, the contact advantage is on their side; but when you lose all the walls, even if God is commanding the defenders, you have to arrange one in each company. Can the high-ranking priest who is listening to him be able to hold it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take two more battalions to the first district. Put them around what 'rebellion clock' Well, you can guarantee that the enemy has no chance to reorganize the defense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A battalion is enough. Besides, even if they can reorganize in the first district, What can we do? Our right-wing striker has already broken through the west of the city, and the left-wing sleeves have already passed the Matthew River! Even if they retake the first zone, they are just trapped in the lonely city."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Imperial Staff members talked excitedly and discussed the current situation. Before the emergence of electric energy and universal magic education, as long as all important walls were broken, the siege war was over. Technically, it is impossible for the defending party to organize street fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief commander of the emperor's team and the minister of the emperor, the old Duke of Fegota felt a little uneasy. He can only repeatedly emphasize the importance of this war, trying to calm down these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't forget to emphasize the military discipline, military discipline! Lenny will become the southern governor's palace, and may even become the second imperial capital! Especially those Public, tell them that it is not the time to plunder! The enemy may concentrate the squad at any time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A staff member rushes in from the door and conveys The latest news: "His Royal Highness! There is another battalion in the third district that has been reorganized!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One battalion, nearby Central Guards There are also four battalions, no problem..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the dazzling radiance of magic swept the entire staff. The detective screams, but even without his screams, there is no magical ordinary staff who can feel the vibration of this magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me crystal sunglasses!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old duke of Fegota yelled and ripped open A scroll of "Detect Magic". He picked up the lens polished with black crystals and placed it in front of him, looking to the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even through the black crystal, the magical light is still shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the empire and Republican navies and the army all the magic cannons are added together, it may not be able to achieve this brightness. In the life of the old duke, I have never seen such a bright magical scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Freedom Bell' is the initiator of the final battle of the Southern Army...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why our security department doesn't know about this!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff members boiled up and stunned about this sudden change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, all magical links have expired!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Minister of Military Affairs, we The forwards, the Guards and the Guards of the Guards all ignited the urgency of the bonfire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the old Duke of Figota was unconscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held the sunglasses, turned around and looked around the entire command. All the staff were quiet, waiting for the command of the veteran. Those who are over-excited are finally no longer feeling that they are omnipotent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty is ahead of us, he is in the East Third District. We don't know the power of this magic, nor the boundaries of this magic. You are too young, no Knowing the impact of the Free Army's first concentration of all artillery and magic cannons. If this new magic is as dangerous as the gunpowder weapon 20 years ago, we will all die here."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loren von? The old duke of Fegota is getting faster and faster. I don't know if it is an illusion. The nobility staff thinks that he seems to be a lot younger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We don't have to take risks. We must start organizing the retreat before the magic swallows us all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The old man closed his eyes, dispelled his own detection magic, took the sunglasses, and picked up the sword of the family's coat of arms on the scabbard from the foot of his long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And we will lead the largest reserve team to save our emperor. If possible, use flesh and blood for him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the far side of the west, the hooves sounded louder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have heard it. The unusual voice is the footsteps of the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The hoof sounds like a ride. This solitary hoof is stepping on the gravel paved road and heading straight east. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can’t hear such subtle sounds, which is unreasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the magical aura is even more unreasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great irrationality always masks small irrationality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The reserve team comes with me and goes to the emperor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night will be exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***-***-***-***-***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;August 9th, 16th, 6th (Mday+130) Lenny East 3rd District? Empire Side<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***-* **-***-***-***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Anne’s magic was launched, the Emperor was trying to get through the Central Trunk Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the failure of the Third Army’s second attack attempt, the Guardian’s attack also retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 30 minutes, four attacks were organized by completely different forces, which is enough to prove the elite qualities of these imperials entering the city. Even in the battlefields of the nineteenth century, most units were unable to organize such high-frequency attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the opposite Freedom Army has more than one battalion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stopped the main road, rebuilt the barricade, and established a military station in the nearby narrow alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Army officers who escaped their lives greeted each other and launched the entire defense system against their respective defense manuals and expanded the small piece. Hard land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first it was a baron, then a viscount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Foreign Secretary Kewei Hugh? Earl of the Eagle Wing arrived, he found that he was not the first Earl to arrive, and the other two counts The loss of the Guardian Knight is being counted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, this may lead to a dispute over command, but not now - because Gustav’s Majesty is also in his ranks in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the problem? Ask a question, Eagle Wing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The emperor’s question was very light, but very serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Eagle Wing nodded and let the trial knight, who was almost full of his own, begin to move forward. The Liberal Army opposite seems to recognize these coats of arms, and the eunuchs began to mobilize the troops nervously to prevent the Cavaliers from making a direct assault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count frowned: "This magic seems to have met before... no."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He saw the purple halo familiar to the chapter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will not be the chapter of excellence...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this doubt, he Did not participate in this charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, he confirmed this and turned back to report to the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is that 'excellence chapter'? That's great. Retreat, Eagle Wing," Gustav said coldly. The surrendered soul cannot find freedom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor stepped forward and reached out and issued an order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "Surrenders...Captain. You are finished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence There was a storm in the mind of Naimen Soledon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face is blue, the commanding sword in his hand is also on the ground, and the legs are moved forward step by step without control -<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at this moment, the whole world is bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young captain shook his legs and squatted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at this time, the whole world is quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor’s tongue suddenly froze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t continue his commanding skills, he can’t even make any sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone also stopped breathing because they saw the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said that there must be light; there is light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a hoof, and the horseshoe slammed on the avenue of Lenny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the emperor suddenly found that everyone around him was looking for the source of the hooves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all heard the hooves, the hooves from the west, shrouded in rainbow light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hoofs are like knocking directly into their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singular, mysterious, and horrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor and his ministers can hear the Coleman soldiers screaming and madly firing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detecting magic readings are high, low, and high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, their shooting sounds were connected together; but then they calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like no one has ever fired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Got it. Got it. Got it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The firearm fired occasionally, and the surroundings were quiet and somewhat depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the hooves on the stone road are getting faster, just like the rain that hit the early autumn forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噼啪,噼啪,噼啪,噼啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty! As the avant-garde Second Army troops are routing! They are asking for reinforcements..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Sending shouts and screams. No one is moving. No one has reinforced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty! The return of the 5th Army of the Central Guards is a hit! They..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that The hooves did not stop, crossing one line after another, passing through one army after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Recover-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This horse screams, it sounds like a half-beast likes The big speakers are so sharp and harsh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This horse humming sounds like a ghost of a thousand undead horses in the same voice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nama is in front of the emperor of the empire, his minister and the entire army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you enter no one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horsewoman’s cloak was blown by the night wind, hunting and flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-armed beauty is so proud and standing before the entire army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no fear in her eyes, or a singular arrogance, but an astonishing indifference and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are overwhelmed by her beauty, not even remembering her beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lightly opens her lips and says, "Your voice--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this familiar He was not surprised when the sound of the door was ringing in the ear of Sorenton. He certainly knows his adjutant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blonde Lieutenant, Anne Seifer jumped into Malay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her arms are flat, pointing straight ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The azure gemstone decorated with a Mithril necklace is hung on the only remaining wrist, and the gem is emitting a faint blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, with the exception of the door, no one can notice her broken arm, let alone laugh at the broken arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"--I heard it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the door is looking at it already The other hand that disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What have you secretly experienced in the days of leaving Jena, Anne?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The entire arm is almost shoulder-to-shoulder, leaving only the substitutes made of magic crystal. The magic flows in the arms, and even the magician can see the fantastic streamer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She goes on to say: "Your wishes-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but one-armed beautiful girl, It gives people a more beautiful and inviolable feeling. The silhouette of her figure looks more glamorous than when the limbs are intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"--I also understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light blue light in her hand is bright stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blu-ray is dazzling, like the second moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light blue magic condenses into dew and spreads like a raindrop to her side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic bullets rise from her back, condense and shine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Faith gives us strength. Knowledge gives us a way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tip of her blonde hair It is crimson, with a bloody fragrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows what this fragrance means. There are more than 10,000 soldiers in the west of the East Third District, and at least 2,000 of them are deployed on the main road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire imperial striker, avant-garde and midfielder fell apart in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can stop her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it blocks once. Even if you stop one step. Even if it blocks a second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial court mages panicked and began to whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magical missiles are just introductory magics? Isn't that the magic used to practice magic manipulation for each novice mage?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only one person can manipulate that number of magic missiles?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if there is a battalion The mage may not be able to manipulate that amount! This is not what humans can do! Impossible! The dragon is impossible! All magic theories do not support this magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The array of magic bullets is getting denser and denser, and now it looks like it’s foggy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not manage theory can support it! This is reality! The reality has been changed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I can't manipulate the magic! The magic around me is too concentrated. All the mid-level magicians can't fight! It's too dangerous, kneel, please retreat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Blue light covering the entire street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blue light, her voice is clear and audible. Judging by the standard of magic spells, these spells are not at all confusing, but they are very simple and easy to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We use it to draw black and white. Use it to separate the light and dark."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She The fingers gently twitched and provoked the nerves of the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If reality and ideals don't match, then we change the reality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her magic is now Gathered in the clouds, covering the entire street, covering everyone's eyes. How big is this magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone’s rhetorical sounds like those legendary novels The villains struggling in the same struggle are not enough. It is hard to believe that this problem would be asked by Ke Wei? Hugh? Eagle Wing, the foreign minister and the head of the trial knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunshine-looking one-armed blonde beauty chuckled, she replied: "My name...not too important. Anyway, it was just casual." So, let's get started."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magic that does not exist in this era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magic that does not require strict gestures, spells, and rituals. In the later years, astronomers discovered that some distant bright stars that looked like ordinary stars were actually nebulae composed of astronomical stars. Based on this discovery, the completed strategic battle was named with ten magics -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "...starocean!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her only remaining right arm was shrouded in blue light, turning into a dazzling blue sun!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perfect command chain of the Empire was also confused. Not only Gustav? Hugh Coleman is issuing orders, but all the counts, viscounts and barons are also issuing orders. The commands are various, but the intentions are exactly the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Protect your knees to retreat! Retreat immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody wants to be with that horrible magic Positive confrontation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is already late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue sun gathered at a point has turned into countless meteor showers and poured down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful meteors fluttered, rushing along the streets and lanes, and mercilessly drowning the imperial convoys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like covering a shelling, or covering the shell with extreme precision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least seven hundred emperors lost their combat power under this magical bombardment, including at least ninety nobles, officers, magicians, and pastors. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not because of previous attacks that have already evacuated some wounded and defeated soldiers, the loss of the emperor may be even greater. But even then, after the end of the shining of the sea of ​​stars, there are no more than fifty enemies standing in front of Anne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court mages made every effort to create a set of defensive enchantments around the emperor, protecting the emperors, ministers and other key personnel. The emperors who had the privilege of being on the roads and buildings also escaped this nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they can stop the horror of magic, can escape the direct attack of magic, but can not stop the mental shock brought by the wounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne's magic didn't kill everyone. Thousands of magical missiles are really just low-level magic, even if one person has seven or eight hairs is not fatal enough -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but enough to beat them flesh and blood blurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who have had the privilege of having more than 20 episodes are almost immediately dying, and it is unlikely that they will be able to succumb to the tens of of them. But those who have fallen a few times and fell to the ground have caused the greatest mental impact on those who have not been injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire street is red and black. Any part of the human body that can be thought of may be hit by these high-temperature meteors and burned. The wounded soldiers licked the wound, rolled on the ground, screamed with all sorts of accents, and shouted at the name of their mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield is bloody and cruel. However, a gentleman-like array of battles and cruelty, there is no such a hundred people at the same time shouting hell scene to be cruel. More than one court mages spit out on the spot, even the veterans were no exception. Even the new army and the militia felt sick and spit out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of the emperor know that these seriously wounded people can be saved. But they also know that now is not the time to save people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Scope flash (massblink)!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several high-ranking court mages are preparing for the same This fastest escape magic, with the emperor and the people around him evacuated from the danger zone in an instant flash. The other side's magic obviously needs amazing time to prepare, and any magic that sings for too long is dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor, the foreign minister, and the court mages disappeared at the end of the street, leaving only countless unintentional wounded, and those who lost their command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the magic of strategic battles. It can cause a huge number of casualties, and each casualty needs to consume at least the same number of combatants to rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne did not pursue, but turned around and walked to the side of the door that was still on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am back, sir," she told him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anne, who are you...?" he said to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just smiled there faintly, but it looked like she was the queen of the whole world. No, or should it be a goddess? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am still your adjutant. Please order it in the name of the Western Army, sir?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Annie deliberately made this sentence very loud. The free army rioted like a glimmer of light in the dark night of despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Western Army? Wait a minute...do you say..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Western Army Has it broken the encirclement of the enemy?! Can we save the situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne patiently waited until this emotion was fermented for a while before the Malay was taken, no doubt The ground pushed the door to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seemingly invincible emperor fled. The emperor who surged in the tide was so defeated. Everything that happened in front of me was like a dream, and the door was not even reacted for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until he heard someone whistling and shouting "I introduce this lady first", it returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He coughed twice, cleared his throat and said to the crowd: "This is the battle of the Western Generals... Hey, Chief Mage Sefer Lieutenant. And I, some of you may not know, is the Western Army’s staff member, Captain Soledon. We are here by the new Marshal of the Free Army, Lord Clade Lopez.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne smiled and nodded lightly: "We are here, which means the Western Army is here. You are not the last force of the Freedoms, remember, The Marshal’s army is still in your north! It’s your resistance that gives us another chance. And then, you have a more important task. You have to guard Lenny.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People cheer up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guarding Lenny! For our motherland, guarding Lenny! Long live Marshal Lopez!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Long live the Western Army! Long live Marshal Lopez!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen and Annie looked at each other and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t have to ask her the truth of the magic, she doesn’t have to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't have to ask her arm, she doesn't have to ask the blood on his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two just tacitly revised the comparison of the combat effectiveness of the two sides, and decided the next battle plan according to the new situation, just like the general staff of the Western Army. The same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows she will recognize the plan, and she knows that he will make a calm and wise judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The soldiers of the emperor!" said the door, shouting loudly. "I know that you, and your wounded, have been abandoned by the emperor! But, we It is a morally just army! You are free to rescue your wounded. The Free Army here will not attack you! Save your comrades!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;> The hearers of the free army laughed and swept away the desperate atmosphere of the rout all night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is not a humane consideration. Whether it is the wounded who survived or the other who rescued the wounded, the horror of this new type of magic will be transmitted to the entire army. Fear will spread like a plague, causing their morale to fall to the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least, on the faces of the emperors who came out of the lanes, they could no longer see the expression "optimistic" or "victory". It is. They were as dead as they were, and they inspected the wounded on the ground in two to three, and helped each other to leave the hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door rises and raises the arm: "And you, you have to defend the parliament building. You, the parliament is about to reconvene! Let the four-color cross flag fly again, tell Everyone, go to the inner city! Go to the first district!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
