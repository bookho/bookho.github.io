			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's time to get up! You have been too busy recently, you should get up early!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crisp The female voice echoed in the bedroom. The thick black curtains were pulled tightly and they could not see the sun shining outside. The furnishings in the bedroom are very simple, the hue is almost all the cool colors of black, blue, gray, brown, and there is nothing to display. If the owner of the bed is not covered with a long blond hair and two thighs outside the quilt, no one would think that this is a lady's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really annoying, Mai Li... let me sleep a little longer..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The owner of the room whispered in bed, turned over and planned to continue to sleep. Drinking a little bit last night, she felt a little hangover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's time to get up! Recently you are too busy, you should get up early!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"True Noisy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman lying in bed touched under the pillow and touched a illusion magic scroll, throwing it in the direction of the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is anything, use this thing first to handle it for me. I really want to sleep a little longer..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's time to get up! Recently you are too busy, you should get up early...oh!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing falls underground sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the room was awakened by this voice, slammed up and looked in the direction of the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the sly sleepy eyes, she saw the gray recording alarm clock falling underground. On its panel, the green fluorescent contrasts the black LCD number "08:00 am". It is also repeating the phrase "It's time to get up!", using the voice of her sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one person in the room from beginning to end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When was Miley recorded?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She closed her eyes, Grabbing the long hair of the unkempt, I can't think of life and death. This alarm clock has not been heard for several days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did she come back to me last night to set an alarm clock? This week, I should only see her three times. It is said that they live together, but always I can't see anyone. She is really busy recently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl groped for the slippers and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Specially set the alarm clock here, and also turn the volume to the maximum, is there anything? Ah...yeah..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought, picking up one side of the curtains. A large expanse of sunshine rushed through the cracks and shone on her face, quite warm and glaring. The sapphire on her chest necklace sparkles in the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sun, stretched out a thorough lazy, feeling refreshed a lot. The figure in the brown checkered pajamas is reflected on the floor-to-ceiling windows. It may be the relationship that just got out of bed, and it seems to be somewhat euphemistic. I always feel that the skin is not as good as before, and some wrinkles appear in the corners of my eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you write too many papers last night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-speaking In the language, I know very well that it is not the only reason. Using illusion magic can really cover up, but it is just a cover up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened the floor to ceiling window. On Sunday morning in winter, DeLand's morning breeze was a bit cold, and she added a cold magic to herself. The air is quite refreshing, giving people the urge to have a cup of coffee on the balcony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, just drink." The blonde turned and ran into the dining room, plugged in the coffee machine, and sipped a cup of coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a little pleasure and satisfaction, take a coffee and sit down on the balcony, overlooking the city from there, looking for a busy research life A little bit of relaxation. Magical research has never been a romantic and relaxed business. It takes a lot of hard work and hard work...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She talked to herself and began to enjoy the leisure of the holiday. The aroma of coffee infiltrates into the heart, making her feel comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After drinking coffee and re-entering the room, she began to conceive today's itinerary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it good to go shopping, or go to the movies?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the 19th century DeLand is a beautiful city, the damage caused by the mainland war has disappeared, and people have built new landscapes on the ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, no matter what you do, you can only go alone..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking of this, she suddenly lost interest in going out and boring back to bed. The eyes accidentally swept through the wall calendar, with a few lines of words on it, and the writing was familiar. It was the word of Mai Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"February 14th Sunday Note: Sister! Today is the day of the thesis defense, don't be late! 9:00 am!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Worse, bad! Fortunately, I noticed early!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is an important day for the doctoral thesis defense! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Location... Location... Arcane Magic Academy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place to reply In the prestigious Keman Union University Arcane Magic Academy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took off her pajamas in a hurry, put on a set of light gray formal suits that barely fit the occasion, and ran to the bathroom to make up the makeup. Fortunately, it's all done, it only takes 20 minutes, no need to use illusion magic to create a neat and spiritual appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really fast. I thought that the doctoral degree is so far away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp She didn't feel nervous at all. In the past, it was like a dream. She finally stood on the peak of magic - although there is still a gap between the legendary man, but it is also a peak of the times. The University of the Union has been known for its strict rigor, and even eight divisions have been denied a degree record. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, she could only look up at that person; now, she has also touched the edge of his field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why do you feel confused? Why are you confused? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The era of magical pioneering has long since ended, and the glory of the rational era has retreated. The last batch of geniuses shined and burned out in the mainland war, leaving only the qualifications of the "silent generation" behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this era, there is no room for ideals and dreams to survive; the world is functioning as usual, magic education has become popular, civil rights movement, feminist movement, racial equality movement, The environmental protection movement is steadily advancing. The members of the Magic Arbitration Association have never been as many as they have now, and the papers and results have never been as much as they are now, but the pioneering results have been the least since its establishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be times when there will be geniuses and heroes, but she will certainly not be included. History is driven by the people, but no one wants to be the "people." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled bitterly. Perhaps this is the nature of mankind? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tick", a text message appears on her mobile phone. Ten years ago, people used telematics, telephone and magic for long-distance communication. It is estimated that in the next decade, magic like "traveling" will disappear from the magic book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I may be late to ^_^sister"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of the Arbitration Association, Still so busy. Forget it, don't come, don't come...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's so indifferent. Remember that you still owe her a favor..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She picked up her handbag, ran out the door and took the elevator downstairs. The republic building in which she lives is still standing here, but it seems to be a bit old, with mottled and wall hangings scattered in the gaps of the building, just like the memories of her death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to the station, but unfortunately can only see the train quickly leaving. She saw the tired and helpless face reflected on the icy glass window of the subway train, just like her lack of enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ran out of the station and took a taxi. Although it is completely unnecessary to do this with her magic, she does not want to use magic today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taxi stops and stops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it has passed the peak of work, the traffic jam is still so powerful. People living in the free city of DeLand have always been so impatient, always rushing, not knowing where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When can I have the funds to build a magical array? If there is a full-scale transmission of magic and magic, you can shuttle freely like a fairy. The road will be empty." The taxi driver slammed the steering wheel and complained about the traffic. "I heard that Honglinasti never stopped traffic jams."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's because the elves don't need cars." The girl smiled and she heard it. I know that this taxi driver has never been to the capital of Sansen. "And, the magical array is not necessarily good. We can't make a magical array that can choose the target location at will. We can only create a magical array of two or two. It's easy to get lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is always a magical rush! It doesn't take up space."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't necessarily take place The transmission of the magical array is a big part. The city of the elf is still built on the giant wood. There are countless layers in nature, and it is good to use. What should we do in our city? Even if it is really built into countless layers, human beings The brain may not be able to remember the map. "There was no meaning in her mouth, her eyes staring out the window. Those who have received advanced magic education are swiftly passing in the low air, and the flying magic plus the acceleration of the magic is much better than the car that is blocked. After the completion of the global magic network, there are more people who can do this - the only drawback is that they can not carry large luggage, otherwise they will fly very tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also, if you send the magic array so well, who is still taking a taxi?" The taxi driver "嘿嘿" smiled twice and continued patiently waiting. The traffic moves. However, this time is too long. He pressed the horns a few times and held his head to see. "In the end, what is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You didn't observe the magic, don't you see it yourself?" The driver next to him replied dissatisfied. "There is a crazy guy, or a high-level wizard who will control gravity, stopping the four-track light rail and saying that he wants to surprise his lover!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What?... These senior mages are simply... have this ability and talent, why don’t you contribute to society!” The taxi driver groaned dissatisfiedly and turned to the passenger who was sitting behind. "Miss, if you are in a hurry, it is better to go to a transfer mages, maybe a little faster. Who knows when the repressive troops will arrive..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is exposed Smile, with a bit of awkward tone: "Then I left the deposit and will come back soon." After that, she pulled the door and leaped into the sky, flew in the direction of the traffic jam, faster than all other people flying. It’s all a lot faster, like a meteor that passes through the low sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she came back, she just caught up with the traffic and started moving. "Solve, drive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you a strong mage like you, take a taxi?" The driver asked with some doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I want to ride a car today." She smiled. Since my old sports car broke down, I have not been in the car for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time I take the car, she will remind her of her past days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the beginning of the story? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it was before or after, she never remembered it at all - only that special day was particularly clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beautiful song from the radio - this is the theme song "Walk" of the now popular fantasy big river drama "Multi-turret battle" That is an overhead story in a world without magic, known as "the most rigorous fantasy world setting", the original setter even made a whole set of magical world technology tree. The content of the story is about the story of a strategic aviation fleet that promotes its ability to fight against fictional enemies and is now popular among teenagers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You taught me how to fly, I have not forgotten<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please continue to fly, leave a trail in the sky<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;You never admit defeat, so others call you "myth"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory has been a bit far away, but it is no stranger. At that time, she was not a magician, but an ordinary person who had received a little magical education. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally, in the dream, remember the scene that first met: she remembered driving a red roadster that day, along the way from Emmon to Sotaland The highway travels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the scene of the scene, always covered with a layer of romantic and bloody shallow ochre filters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A faint blues surrounds the sound field of the car for a long time, and the upper and lower memories are decorated with black edging and yellow mottled lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is fate, it must be an accidental fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a coincidence, it must be a coincidence of heavenly arrangements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black wind blew across the sky, and the black death passed over the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grass in early summer becomes yellow, and there are no more leaves on the branches of the trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red and black blood is covered with plains, and the roaring monsters and soldiers fall into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roar of the explosion came from the distant sky, and the plane that lost control fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembers driving unconsciously, waiting for the coming of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the light swooped down from the distant sky, and she looked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person stopped in front of her and was smiling at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Do you need help? If you like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I will borrow your body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your ship never Lying, it has always been with me<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its light is still shining, but now I am flying alone<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps I just crossed a dream, but in my opinion it is really incomparable<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic, it should be used like this."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guns of all the guns exploded at the same time, and the black barrels fell to the ground at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She, or he raised his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge wind shield is filled in the muzzle of the automatic rifle, and the combat power of the enemy is lost in the explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is what you call powerful, then I am not impressed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green The acid mist fluttered along with the ventilation ducts, with a breath of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She, or he raised his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The folding fan in the hand made a huge storm, and the green acid mist was blown away from the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man who once ruled the empire over all enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who once was alone and the enemy of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That person is her, she is that person. He is by her side, he is in her consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver-white pistol trembled gracefully, shooting a deadly projectile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person has always been with her, never left; but then she still knows nothing about her own mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days of loneliness are always long, and the days of happiness are always short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has never seen his face and has not touched his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought she would never have feelings for him, she thought she wanted to get rid of that person's entanglement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later she found herself completely wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love never depends on face or sweet talk, but on spiritual communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she and he are always engaged in spiritual communication, she thought it was a very irrelevant thing. Later she realized that it was like breathing and air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she has it, she does not cherish it; when she no longer owns it, she is eager to be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, missed ones will not be reproduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change the course of the ship, turn the steering wheel in the hand<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rush into the storm and break through it狂澜<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use brilliance to dispel all darkness<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a man called Nogu; Leitnov, He is a madman who wants to rebuild the medieval kingdom of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some women called "blood rose" who always want to maintain the equality and peace of the world in secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, she thought that this dark world event would never be related to her mortal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his help, she entered the Magical Goods Trading Company, one of the largest companies in the world; after that day, everything has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She felt like she was a stormy eye, and all the storms were entangled around her. Of course, there are also new friends and new enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man seems to be born with the ability to attract trouble... The bad thing is that she seems to be infected by him as well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She once traveled with him to the capital of the free country, playing in the buildings of casinos, streets and memorials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She once sneaked into the Wyvern Dragon Nature Reserve with him, where he saw the sage of the fate of two machine guns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also worked with him to save the world and destroy Nogu; President Leitnov provoked a conspiracy of the new world war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, she did not intend to save the world - in fact, she did not save the world in the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who saved the world is - he is always used to saving the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, now she is used to saving the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am falling, rolling to the ground<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems a bit troublesome, reality never So perfect as a dream<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most impressive thing about Reese is the days in the glass showcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the door is not in a certain thing, she was kidnapped by the enemy; but the person is a metamorphosis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, her skin was turned into a rock and was placed there as a statue. Her blood and internal organs became graphite, and the heart of soft stone was still beating very slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, she realized that she could not do anything if she left him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As every moment, every minute, every second of the stone statue, she is waiting for her. She knew that the last one to save her must be him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, after re-becoming a flesh-and-blood body, the first thing I saw was a strange man--but she still immediately looked at the man’s eyes. Identify it, that is him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, she finally understood that she could not do without him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the flying air battleship outside the window, the Dragon Knights who are fighting, the burning city, can’t divert her attention . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably okay, anyway, your hypnotism also makes me feel nothing in these two days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is stiff and puts on a smile, says something in her mouth, wants to prove that she has nothing, can go with him to face danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he still chose to keep her safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Do you really go away? Bastard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I promised - - I will definitely come back and protect you again. Hurry and go back and wait for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said so, resolutely went to the battlefield of the final battle. It was the night of July 10, 1889. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, he is back - but only just back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s time to fly freely, the trail in the sky is flying<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maybe I’m crossing A dream, but for me, that incredibly true<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so free to fly, even if I go deep into the storm, I will not fail<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tremble and get rid of the bondage to freedom<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe it is sudden, but I have to leave."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the battle with Nogu, I lost too much power...even more than I lost in the mainland war last time."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"great cross is over, I have no extra strength, and now I have to go back to my own space and restore strength there."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe you are very surprised, but during this time, I really added a lot of trouble to you, I apologize here. From now on, you can live a normal life. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, in order to express my intention, I have specially reserved a gift for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that this gift will provide you with enough help. Before I leave, I have sealed all my experience and magic power into it, and it should be enough for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This gift may not be what you want, but I can do it for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"As I promised, I will always use my power to guard you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, I hope that you will live happily ever after, all the best Miss Quillahia... No, Reese. If the dream is over, forget it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“btw:spell slayer in the drawer of your dresser "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened the box and picked up the sapphire pendant, bursting into tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that moment on, she is not a ignorant girl, she has become a real woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That year, Reese; Quillahiya is 21 years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
