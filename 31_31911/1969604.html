The snow line struggled to the north and left, leaving only the plunge of the cold winter rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If future weather forecasters come to talk about this matter, it’s about a bunch of terms like “high pressure ridge” and “front”; For people, the only thing that can be trusted is the prophetic magic that predicts the accuracy of the magician's 70% accuracy - and may not be more than the weather forecast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last month of the standard calendar 1665, the eyes of the whole world gathered in Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people call the "city of freedom" Lenny the core of the southern republics, and will be located at the mouth of the Meteby West River, one hundred and one hundred miles away from Lenny The ten-kilometer "second fortress of the republic", Fortiburg, is known as the hub of the republics. Fort Buddha was founded in 1066, shortly after the recovery of the Second Dynasty. The purpose was to "maintain the presence of the Emperor's military power in the South, and suppress the inconsistency of the different races in the South, and declare the glory of His Majesty to the distant land." ". In order to ensure the deterrent power of the fortress to the whole of the South, the civil engineer of the Emperor’s majesty took great pains to select the address of the fortress at the mouth of the Meitby River. Even the most critical critics had to admire the decision. The wise of the address of the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called "location of wise" is not "the fortress of the invincible cannon that cuts off the throat of the cloister", "the fortress that is cut off from the mountains in the terrain" or "the fortress" The example of an evil fortress emerged from the huge black door. After all, no one has ever heard of such a strange terrain in the world; Fort Fort is a plain fortress that is designed for garrison and regional control. It is actually made up of land fortresses on both sides of the Metebexi River and coastal fortresses at the mouth of the river. “The mission of the fortress is to keep the army alive.” This design idea implements the architecture and design of the Fortress in Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Fortress to the north, you can control the rich shores of the Gulf, the land of only 100 kilometers north and south is the two territories of Faros-Julk. The most important traffic route between them, if it is cut off, it is only to find the mouths of the Medivh Mountains, which are further north. From here to the west is Lenny, the fortress and the former South Governor's Office are in a corner of each other, which can effectively interfere with the invasion of the invading army or the rebel army. The massive Coast Fortress and Land Fortress fortifications blocked the mouth of the Matterby River, and the powerful Interlake Bay fleet was stationed at Fort Vatburg, providing a waterfront advantage between Lenny and Fort. . Finally, the eastern Italian plains in the southwest of the fortress are the granaries of the republics, supplying the fortress with sufficient supplies throughout the year, enough to allow 30,000 soldiers to support the fortress for one year, or to allow 100,000 soldiers - almost the Free Army. All of the standing forces - support for three months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every political and current commentator is staring at this huge military fortress between the mountains and the river and the sea, because this is the soul of the coup The location. The former Freedom Marshal Radz, who escaped from the nightmare on the evening of December 7th; Gowar, gathered his general command and elite main forces here, and he was with Ruhrock, three hundred and fifty kilometers northwest. People have established a "supervisory government" and announced that they will not actively attack areas and troops still loyal to the Lenny government. As for the military observers, they have keenly noticed the excellent position of the Fortress Fortress: it divided the Freedom Army, which is loyal to the government, into two unconnected corps, Fasos and Lenny, and divided the fleet that is loyal to the government into There are two groups in the river and the ocean that cannot communicate with each other. In a sense, Govar’s claim of “not fighting civil war” may have left many Free Army officers with a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every soldier and officer in our army is not a coup for selfish desires or desire for power. We just hope that we can step in the republics. Correct this before the wrong road. Perhaps in the comfort of the South and the safe East, people who live happily do not know the dangers they face; but as the defenders of the North, the defenders of Ruhrock and the defenders of freedom, we I hope that I can use my own actions to indicate the path that the Republic should have. Appeasement and weakness can not appease the enemy. We must have a strong army, an army capable of defending our country! We do not want civil war, we do not want a week ago. The tragedy of this kind is repeated in a wider area. We always hope that everyone from the Lenny Interim Government can reach an agreement with us to create a new era of better and safer!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the opening speech of the Governor’s government on December 15, Marshal Govara delivered a warm speech and emphasized the good wishes and positives of the governing government. Purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, how many people will believe in the content of this speech is still a question. At least, the senators who survived the death of Lenny are probably not convinced; Clade of the Lenny Army; Lieutenant General Lopez, and Wiener of the Fauses; Admiral Betsy, I am afraid Will believe. The empire and the elves must also consider the issue of robbery or fish in troubled waters, and they will also be scornful about this speech. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- For example, now as the commander of the Lenny and the commander of the headquarters, the young lieutenant in the North Shore Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The rain is always over the next two days... Will it stop in the afternoon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resist the door; Soledon sat bored inside the fortress with heavy wall protection and looked out through the narrow vent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient masonry fortress wall was destroyed twice and rebuilt on the basis of the ruined wall. It is now incredibly heavy. Numerous curved vents and specially crafted dark muzzles are distributed in every corner of the fortress wall. Each vent has only the thickness of the arm, and many rooms can be found in each room. Defensive magic, tilt-and-ballistic design, composite multi-layered walls...all designed for safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, excessive security requirements can only bring more darkness. When the outside is cloudy, the interior of the fortress appears darker and colder. Carrying out paperwork under this illuminance sometimes makes people want to go crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton sighed and reviewed the documents at hand. Supply sheets, confirmations, reports, numbers, numbers, or numbers... Under the dark illumination, the lines of text are twisted like ghosts. Due to the decisive failure of Lenny in the past, the manpower to handle all matters is very scarce, and even his new staff officer has to invest in these complicated and monotonous transactional work. For a civilian teenager who has never done such work before, these things are not easy to understand; but under the circumstance of crisis, he quickly relied on his own mathematical ability to master the basic skills of logistics and staff. . He still dare not lead the troops to patrol or fight: even if it is nominally the commander of the assault company, if he really leads the army without any military experience, he will be immediately recognized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the heel thinking, he knows what will happen if he is seen. His true identity is not a coup army officer, but a civilian; not only that, he is the biggest enemy of the coup army, Klad, and the disciple of Lieutenant General Lopez. In such a period of war, there will be no serious investigations, no military courts...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He snorted and refocused Go to the list of supplies in front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to celebrate this year's Shennar Festival, the special supply list that must be provided on the 25th of this month: one roasting flamingo per class, a total of one Thousands and a hundred. Each soldier is half a pound of ale, for a total of 7,800 pounds. There is also an annual bonus for all soldiers, and an additional one hundred pigs to provide 6,000 pounds of fresh meat, ham and Sausages, as well as military priests and higher food and lighting needs... In order to celebrate the festival, the military cost of additional demand is about 1,900 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After checking the results, he signed the "accurate calculation, approval, sent to the first staff of the staff, Ega; Lieutenant Colonel Eugen" on the request for supplies, and left it on the side. Full of "to be sent" on the shelf. Finally finished the last one... He leaned back on the back of the chair and stretched out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand patted him on the shoulder, he bounced off the seat reflexively and turned alertly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, don't be so nervous. I just want to ask if you're done?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The female sergeant, who is also affiliated with the direct staff of the staff, has a relaxed tone, but her face still has a cold smile. The reluctant smile that she deliberately pretended seemed to Solelton to be a black panther ready to prey, full of precision and danger, and difficult to access. He still can't figure out Itis in the present; Captain Magnum is a man. As the only woman in the staff department, she has a lot of different faces for dealing with chores - but all faces are cold and unpredictable - even under the shame that he has only seen once. This face. Perhaps the staff should be elusive and difficult to speculate on the true intentions? Indeed, everyone here is hard to see through...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does... Is there something new again?! From 7:00 in the morning to one in the afternoon, I didn't even have lunch at lunch, can I let me take a break?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton stared at Margnan’s hand on his back with some concern. I hope that I will not get a new big file from there. Experience tells him that even if the captain is empty, he can't take it lightly. She might find a strong sergeant to help her file. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She magically changed a cast iron lunchbox from the back - this behavior stunned Soleton, and the chin almost dislocated. The troubles and delusions of the juvenile emerged uncontrollably, and he hurriedly expelled these unrealistic delusions. Although her chest is really big, it is really big, but...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, I also brought you the long-awaited rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Relax?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, rest. After fifteen minutes, gather at the North Gate, take the horse The order of Lieutenant Colonel Eugen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis took the lunch box on the table and turned and walked away, not giving him the opportunity to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lieutenant Colonel Eugen...? This noon time...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soledon thought about it with a lunch box. Ega; Lieutenant Colonel eagar eugeue is the de facto dispatcher of this disarmed soldier. He is responsible for the summarization of all intelligence and the handling of daily affairs. In the nightmare of December 7, the staff lost almost all of the senior officers; the coup was revived by the man’s efforts and successfully assisted the main force to retreat during the scuffle that night. Unlike Isis, who looks like an elite staff officer, this young lieutenant colonel is not like an elite staff officer from any angle. It’s really great to be promoted to the Lieutenant Colonel in his twenties, but otherwise...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lieutenant colonel has a short light gray beard, the most on the face The common expression is smirking. When thinking, it is not smoking cigars or smoking, but constantly chewing a gum from Nanxinzhou. Talking to him generally has to be said twice, otherwise the man who concentrates on the gum in the mouth will hear nothing. Although it always looks very busy, but the work efficiency is not high, most of the things are pushed to the team of Captain Itis and Major Kusen. No matter what standard it is, it is not what a mature man should have. Unlike the rest of the team, the lieutenant colonel did not have any prestige nicknames. It seemed to be a low-key general school staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But such a person, but really supports the crumbling situation. He felt that he couldn't see everyone here...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a minute, Soleton opened the lunch box that Captain Magnum brought to him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a standard food for an officer, it’s still cold, and it’s been a while since it’s brought out of the kitchen. He can only smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winter rain permeated the tarpaulin raincoat and kept hitting the shoulders of the young lieutenant, letting him tremble slightly in the cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton was still complaining about the coldness in the fortress, but now he is beginning to miss the fireplace that is not very hot. He tried to remember a little bit of riding that he had learned before, and tried not to let the horse under his arm fall out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a small number of teams around, but all of them are elites. Many of them are familiar with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two guards with two guards, Colonel Eugen, walked in the front, and he chewed the gum as usual, and squatted the tune. Captain Itis's chestnut horse followed him, followed by another captain that she did not know; and then the second serious staff, Peter, who was serious; the Major Peter Kurson. Walking around Soledon is the only one in the entire staff who can't magic. Constance (ss Major, a middle-aged man who is quite a leader, feels like an intelligence officer or a gendarmerie captain. Sorelton I also saw the two soldiers who fired weapons in the chaotic army that day, and they followed the next one. There is no doubt that each of them is an elite member of the staff or the direct troops of the ministry. The ranks are newer than him. Ding is high.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not enough. Soledon turned his head and glanced at the last Radz; Margaret Govar, dismissed the opportunity The idea of ​​running away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a cold and rainy day, such a lineup is too gorgeous. What is this going to do?<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such doubts, Soleton continued to move forward. The gravel road under the horseshoe began to turn uphill, and gradually I could see the division of Fause and Confucianism. The central mountain range of the Republic of Locke. The ramp leading to the north extends all the way to the end of a hill. Under divided into two strands: one to the northwest, while the other branch to the east approaching the fork in the road, the team slowed down <br <br /> & nbsp />; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;..</div>
