The bottomless spiral staircase leaked the secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up, you can see the blue sky not far away. This proves that the building is not underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The princess of the high tower. Will there be a prince from afar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Of course just joking. The emotions of jokes don’t know where they come from, maybe they are hidden in the memory of disappearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory of "self" can never be remembered, only knowledge is barely there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With knowledge, this building is much more than a tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area of ​​each layer is different, and is much larger than the area of ​​the tower built by the general magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A castle-like prison, or a prison-like castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No trace of other people living. Although there are many rooms, only the inanimate creations can be moved back and forth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carefully avoid the unknown threats and carefully sneak through the gospels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that was discovered was the other static field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another similar bed was found in a nearby room. It seems to be there, but it is impossible to see the guests inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably don't wake up better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I don't know how to wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bed is covered with dangerous defensive magic, and the instinct is screaming "Don't approach." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shrugged and gave up the investigation and continued on the road to adventure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go down the stairs and find the library and locker room, each occupying several floors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of library collections is high. Most of the works themselves can touch the magic net, proclaiming their powerful magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curiously pick up a book and read the contents inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic part is subtle, but it can be barely understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the contents of the book, the instructions written between the lines are more attractive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it the owner of this building to write these instructions? It can be seen that the level of the approver is higher than these famous works. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, I feel a little scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a good omen. The stronger your ability in memory, the more dangerous it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe not a princess, but a demon-like demon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; put down The book, taking a deep breath, going out the door, still want to solve the problem of wearing first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a luxurious women's dress in the locker room, preserved in a dust-free wardrobe, spotless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No matter who the owner of this place is, it is very convenient to design..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it is his own "original body" - but this does not have any The memory of yourself is also not a good sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as I walked out, all the walls around me suddenly turned red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alert?! Is it because of my clothes?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning back to return to the building On the top, I stepped on the automatic catching net in front of the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ankle is twisted by the rope, and it’s too late to react with magic – and it’s not prepared at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capture network, like a pendulum, suddenly moves at a rapid speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up and looking up, I found that the net pocket that captured the intruder was hanging on a metal track. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net flies into a cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hands subconsciously grabbed the railings of the iron cage and resisted the panic caused by high-speed flight in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron cage rushed across the slide, volleyed and fell into a large circle of gel, like a giant slime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holding hands and being burned by acid, they touched the soft gel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a buffer. No malicious feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When wrapped in a ball shape, the net pocket, iron cage and gel began to spin rapidly, rushing toward the bottom of the tower along a dark garbage passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until heavily on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few sharp eyes projected in the dark, faintly bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks like a monster in the legend that is chosen in the depths of the maze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but did not feel a trace of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the owner of this place really wants to kill, you can kill it as soon as you set a trap."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe finally see the people who designed this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the owner is not a metamorphosis that likes to watch the beasts shred beautiful prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;September 13th, 1666<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Royal Ayr Ready Pathway "Deluxe Hotel" 2nd Floor /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three men sitting around a Regency style Carved round table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A senior senator in the 60s, an Eastern Marshal in his early 50s, and a barely 20-year-old Major of the Army Gendarmerie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a pot of green tea on the table. Just the details of green tea instead of black tea in the pot prove the taste of this group of people at the table. The export of black tea and green tea is almost a thousand times different. Even the Murrayans have abandoned the habit of drinking green tea on their ancestors. Only the real Orientals will drink green tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have proven that you can be a good military commander, but you have not proven that you can be a good warlord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not waiting for the door to sit at the table, the Navy Marshal gave himself a bowl of tea and threw his basic attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young major looked at him with amazement and wondered if the other person really had this attitude, or just made a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Intrepids are facing enormous pressure. In the future war, the power of Inter will be more than one regular division, one militia division plus two fleets. As the most economically developed republic, Interre will undertake Most of the funds for counterattacks. Whether it is debt or tax increase, this is not something that a young person can take care of, nor is it a matter of hanging you. If you have a case, you are free. The heroes of the army will never be lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At one time, the atmosphere in the seat was very stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mute magic inside and outside is exacerbated by this, only to hear the bubbling sound of hot water in the water bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand your concern about Marshal Wei. I personally feel that, in general, an officer in such an important position should have a deeper qualification. I think we should consider this issue based on reality. Although the qualifications are not enough, the merits of Major Soledon are enough. As for whether he can serve as a supervising force in this oversight position, I think it needs to be considered comprehensively. Of course, I don't mean that he can serve, or can't take it, but we can't afford more risks now. We must have an excellent levy and logistics system, a whole fleet and three new army divisions. To form..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Webster went around and said a lot of words, but there was no one to represent him. Nanimen did not know what he had been talking about with Wei Taiping, but the senator obviously did not want to express his position on the question of "who will serve as the British Trevor." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t look like an ally of Wei Taiping - if the commander of the fleet in the Far East can form a voyage with the members of the Intercontinent for half a year. Allies, then they must be working hard for some goals that are far greater than the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen yawned, holding the letter of appointment in his arms that had not been sent out, recalling the information of Senator Webster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being appointed as the British Regent, he knew that he would deal with the former lieutenant general and the top ranked member of the Intres. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the dissolution of the Joint Parliament, Sam Webster is no longer a member of the Joint Parliament and the Provisional Speaker, but he is still in the Parliament of the Republic of Intre It represents the phase port of the Republic and the Shuanggang Provincial Constituency. The military and political conferences cannot completely change the previous government system. All they can do is to add new impetus to the previous system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Port has been peaceful for a hundred years, and this region accounts for more than one-third of the entire Intra economy and population. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bang of the tea bowl on the table interrupted the idea of ​​the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Put up your politicians and get a good deal at both ends. Members, I want to know your opinion, not the nonsense that everyone knows." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was stunned and looked at the tea bowl in the hands of Marshal Wei Taiping on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the tea inside and all bounced back and sprinkled the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he had previously judged that Wei Taiping and Webster would not be allies, this attitude...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; That is far more than the "not an ally" degree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Taiping ruthlessly sneaked senior members: "This kind of sloppy 'art form' is called 'will be a man' in the Eastern Empire, and is being worshipped The most important of all skills. This art has developed to such a degree in the East: if you don't have this kind of craft, you can't complete any career worth mentioning. But one's ability is limited. If he is too talented, it must prove that he is not too eager to think about other areas that really need ability. It is not that he has an outstanding ability, and even most of the time, even the opposite." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Webster’s lips are shaking slightly, and nothing can be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door saw him repeatedly rubbing the tea stains on the dress with a handkerchief, even if the water stains could not be wiped off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Taiping certainly felt the embarrassment of the members, but the taunts in the mouth of the Navy’s marshals kept going. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was stunned. This is Wei Taiping, the commander of the 7th Fleet of the Extreme East, the most capable of the seven naval marshals in service, and the largest of the remaining fleets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has vaguely guessed how Kazmier Stewart was the captain of the Seventh Fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of subordinates will be there. Since Wei Taiping is not as "confucian" as he seems - this sentence seems to be inaccurate - then a pirate can certainly become a colonel of the Free Navy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about thirty breath adjustments, Webster finally spoke up. His tone was almost as calm as before, and the door couldn't help but admire his cultivation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not bad to talk so straightforwardly. Then I will just say what I think: you deny the appointment of the military and political conference, it is not appropriate, Wei Marshal Navy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Navy Marshal heard a loud laugh: "Is this right? Former Lieutenant General. Only with such efficiency discussion, we are only It is possible to discuss a result before the rabbit scorpions burned the entire building."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Webster snorted. At this moment, he really had the posture of a teacher, and he thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Taiping continued: "You really think that the military and political council appointed such a young man to supervise the supply and distribution of supplies for both East and West. Is it feasible? You should know how much we need to support the army with the trade and taxes on the two big islands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The military and political conference wants to be in the UK Trey recruited three new liberal divisions and national guards, as well as raised funds for two new Faculty and two new Armenian divisions. Of course, the cost of the Seventh Fleet will also be from Intres. In the committee. This is the news I heard, Major Soledon can confirm the authenticity of the plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam Webster seems to be deliberate The land will pull the door into this dialogue. The door was slightly stunned and quickly answered the question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In accordance with the new plan, Interlake will support eight divisions including the second 'Intres' division. Funding and equipment for the division. The size of the Seventh Fleet is also larger than that of the Fifth Fleet, and the total cost may reach two to three times before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two Three times. Yes, yes, the tax plan of the military and political conference is really accurate, just as precise as the tax book of the Eastern Empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Taiping I felt the short squat on my chin and sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, the shit doesn't work, the paper talks about it! What does this million pounds mean? Maybe Webster knows better than me. Weber Sterling Insurance is also a well-known big name in Intre, and will not even be wrong with the accounts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Webster sighs Tone: "It's very difficult, but it's not impossible. Just rely on the Seventh Fleet. I know your great achievements in Lingyangmen Port."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Navy Marshal raised his eyebrows and showed the subtle surprise of the Orientals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you going to propose a general trade tax at the Interrecamp, Mr. Webster? This is beyond my expectation. Lingyangmen performs this The tax system is because there are not many of our merchant ships. The phase port can be very different, and the merchants in the entire port will rise up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not only the general trade Tax. I have also considered temporary property and real estate taxes. At the cost, we can sell tax and private pledges, as well as issue bonds. These bonds and taxes are secured by Unlock’s unclaimed land. The strength of each bank should be able to support us to recover the entire Ruhrlock. Although the solution is difficult, it is all ready-made, and there is no need to turn over with the military and political conference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The old politician said calmly, cocking his fingers one by one. His statement is as organized as the parliament's motion, and it ignores the provocations of the East. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Taiping could not help but ask: "If we can't recover Ruhrlock within a few years? I don't know the situation of the Free Army, but if Even if someone confessed to a ceasefire, the opponent could definitely not cope with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At that time, it was not your problem with me, right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Taiping heavily leaned back, the arrogance slightly converged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, these things can be done without courage. Does this 'fighting hero' know what it means to impose a universal trade tax? He knows who controls the Eastern route, how much power do they have? Does he know how much money you have to pay from the entire poor people in Intres?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marshal Marshal did not expect Nene to answer these questions, he gave the answer himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That means that all ships using the Intra Sea port are subject to our inspections. In this sea area, all belong to the elves, the empire And the merchant ships of the various peaceways will become our enemies. All the private ports and autonomous cities will lurk in the guys who try to get rich through smuggling, they will be against us at all costs. The pressure here, at least It will be several times the sea area near Huachao. If I want my fleet to fight against the alliance of the Empire, Sansen and Taiping Road, I have to have a solid rear. Can this young man give me a solid rear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was taken a deep breath. This is not only a negotiation, but also a test. The cards in the opponent's hand are much larger than his. Whether it is the Intrepid's local tyrants or the tyrannical heroes of the East, there are more resources than him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessing is not going to surrender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will do my best, sir. This is the order I received and the decision of the military and political meeting. If you feel that my appointment is not appropriate, you should also The military and political conference proposed, rather than refused to accept. I will try my best to guarantee the logistical supply through all of my gendarmerie and my gendarmerie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to say I will also go to the military and political conference. I know who this appointment is. Not the old Fox, he is not so radical." Wei Taiping leaned back and turned his tone, it seems to be referring to who, "If the liberal country is regarded as a giant, then the navy is his horse, the army is his sword. The levy officer is his scabbard, and the gendarmerie is his whips. 'It is too obvious." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door slammed from the seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know this too?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, this paragraph is still me Telling Luo Ruide, at that time we were like the history lovers everywhere, discussing the official system of the Eastern Empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secretary Webster frowned Head: "Who is this oriental?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is not an Oriental." Wei Taiping replied faintly, "He uses his real name here, Clade? Lopez, now is the marshal. He is always very lucky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door asked: "Have you worked with him...?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Strictly speaking, there is no. However, when he helped the warlords of the Eastern Empire to discuss the West, I built and defended the Fortress of Lingyangmen." I have to know if the partner that Luo Ruide has arranged for me is appropriate. I have seen too many people who are known as heroes, and most of them are difficult to cooperate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was said to be a word, and it was interrupted by the Orientals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The cooperation I am talking about does not refer to your ability to command the troops. I have seen the ability to command troops and resolve the crisis, above average. The cooperation I am talking about is the ability to execute at a critical moment. Look at these people in the house. If we really get to that step, what will it become?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Navy Marshal stood up and pointed to the crowd in the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The nuns of those empire will become the priests of the fleet that cooperate with the Imperial fleet to wash your fleet. They claim to be under the cease-fire religious understanding agreement, going Doing the Southern Holy Land tour, but if the empire and the elf's fleet are difficult, they probably don't care about looting our tax evasion boat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Navy’s fingers continued to move and moved to the Naval Rear Admiral Daro Salami. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This guy of the Fifth Fleet now looks very docile, because he can retired from the Navy to do his job as long as he does not die here or military law. Rich merchants. But if we levy a general trade tax, he will find a way to hire the wind and steel horse that is chatting with him, and invest in the vigorous smuggling industry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Taiping shrugged and pointed to the group of civilians and officers trapped on the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are some of these guys are Intergraphs, some are not. But as long as we implement a universal trade tax, most of them will Add to our enemies, either explicitly or implicitly. Even the one who is in front of you and wants to have a good relationship with you, Mr. Sam Webster, will become your enemy - unless you give him Point benefits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Webster finally showed anger, his fists lie on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorkeeper noticed that although the member’s punch was not very strong, the action was exceptionally precise, and there was no extra movement. The fist fell on the table. Not even rebounded, but the table trembled for a while. Only some faction magicians are so focused on the control of unwanted movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is ** naked filth, Pierce Wayne! Take back your words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Okay, indirect benefits. Do you swear that you will never use this young man? I don't believe that the most powerful members of the Republic of the Republic will say this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orientals did not give senior members the opportunity to continue to refute and point their fingers at themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I will probably become the enemy of both of you. You, on behalf of the potential smugglers of the whole British Trey. You, give eight An army division supervises replenishment. My naval fleet is responsible for checking the smuggling behavior in this sea area. There are many potential risks in this area, so I don't have to continue to analyze it."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marshal’s fingers almost stayed on the bridge of the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, the gendarmerie major, the problem is very simple. Do you have enemies with everyone in this room, but also the consciousness of the British Trevor Your true friend is not at this level, but among the guys who burn and rob the following. Do you have the consciousness to kill so many people who are innocent with them?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is very eager to say "yes", but he can't say it. He knows he can't do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't have this awareness, you won't receive three times the tax, I can only go to Marshal Lopez to ask for a substitution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are always other ways." Naomi answered with a sullen sigh. "If you want to collect the money and then distribute it, there is always a way."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not difficult to just collect the money. However, to receive an extra double tax, it becomes a very different issue. There is such a sentence in the Eastern Empire. Words: 'Broken people's wealth roads like murder parents'. Do you have other ways to raise 10 million gold pounds?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young majors are silent. This number is too big, beyond the understanding and computing power of the average person. A major annual salary of a major is only a few dozen gold pounds, compared to 10 million gold pounds is a small number that is not worth mentioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intra is not without money, and the entire civilized world may not have a richer area than the Intresas Island. However, every gold coin will be covered with blood. To double the tax in a short period of time, it can only be collected by blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will not accept the appointment you brought, young people. I will still ask the military and political conference to appoint more Intercontinental military ambassadors. The conditions for the Seventh Fleet to take over. You have talent, but you are not the kind of person who is determined to let his hands be covered with blood. You are not suitable for this position." Wei Taiping faintly concluded, "In addition, I will also go to the military and political affairs at the same time. The meeting requested that the remnant of the transformation of the Fifth Fleet be pardoned and compiled into a escort fleet to enrich the power of the West Intrestre. With the management ability of the Major General, the remaining ships should be able to survive. He also needs one. The commander of the fleet, I believe that Luo Ruide can find a person who is not under my control. In this way, we will solve this change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Sam Webster stood up and walked out of the range of silent magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s an interesting person. He didn’t really get angry until the end.” The Marshal Marshal played the teacup in his hand and said his conclusion directly. Then you, do you still have problems, young people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door feels uncomfortable, just like a defeat. Wei Taiping’s negotiation method is not the same as all the generals he has seen. This person will force everyone outside the subordinates to go to the springboard like a pirate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is very efficient. In the hands of those who have the power and intelligence, this kind of negotiation is extremely efficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took only a little while, and Wei Taiping imposed his prepared policy on his two negotiating opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Naimen agrees to this plan, the subsequent Intres will be completely controlled by the Seventh Fleet. In fact, he had to agree to these conditions, otherwise he would not be able to solve this transformation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn't want to be so ugly to defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since President Wei Taiping likes straightforward dialogue, I have the last straightforward question to ask you..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is deeply breathed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The transformation of this scale cannot be spontaneous, nor can it be organized by the general. I want to know who is behind the scenes." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He directly dropped the most acute problems he could think of on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you must find a black hand behind the scenes, it is me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ningmen stared at the behind-the-scenes black hand who admitted his identity straight, and his eyes seemed to see a double-headed troll who was spitting out acid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Taiping continues indifferently: "Because my fleet arrived, it will trigger the anger of these people. These angers are already there, they It must be vented in some form. The arrival of the Seventh Fleet is the fuse, and the quarrel in the bar is the fire. The army is born with organization, so it is particularly easy for the chain to become a huge riot." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door silently nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But then, occasionally it’s changing, it’s not a bad thing to die. The bad guys are there, pretending to be invisible or pretending to be harmonious. It’s useless. The sailors are mobilizing the land on the land, and it’s better than waiting for them to get the fleet and then launching the troops. In this sense, you can say that I organized this transformation. From us, we were transferred to deal with it. From the time of the Imperial Fleet, this metamorphosis has been doomed. It may not even be the last one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no evidence for this." One sentence, "I still want to know, did you instruct people to initiate this transformation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does that really matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chill climbed up the back of the door. He got up and fled the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Navy’s personal guarantee, persuasion The changing sailor is very easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen does not remember what promises he said, but Major General Daro has been following his own steps, with tears in his eyes, and the opening must be called "adults" . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailors dragged their injured companions, hands behind their heads, and under strong escorts, one team and one team walked out of the building and left the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was standing in front of the gate and watching the prisoners leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most terrible thing is not being degraded by the naval marshal, but he knows that Wei Taiping is completely right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is odious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Money, fleet and army. Logistics, economy and taxation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, fighting heroes really have to be much better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just for the protection of the Seventh Fleet, so many people have died. If you want to charge three times the tax, how many more people will die? This number is hard to imagine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nuns from the orthodox church thanked him in front of him, and Ninten nodded to them and patiently listened to their requests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just listening, not thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nuns said something about going to Interry for a tour, and communicating with the important Protestant retreats. Naimen only nodded and promised, and then pushed things to Major General Daro, promised to find a way to dredge them to Interry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stands to reason that he shouldn’t have promised so refreshed, but there are two reasons for him to agree. First, his mind is still full of money problems, nothing to think about anything else. Secondly, these ambassadors are all women, and the door is also smelling the smell of the smell that seems to have been smelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Interlake has the Orthodox Church of the past with great land and wealth, it’s good to endure the door, so that it can solve the military problem. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, those churches were liquidated as early as the independence of the southern countries, leaving only some of the old holy sites that were transformed into tourist spots. survive. Even so, these tourist spots are also an important source of income for the new teachings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that the military’s military spending relies heavily on the sacred bonds issued by the church and the church. There seems to be any way, but I can't catch it for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nun who exudes a familiar smell tried to talk to him several times, but was pulled by the people around him. The tall nun and the black-haired nun struggled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a bit noisy, and the door is holding his hair and thinking about it, re-entering the warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailors are almost gone. The priests of the gendarmerie were carefully cleaning up the fuel on the ground, and the representatives sent by the Seventh Fleet were also mixed in them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kezmi?Stehaus has not left yet, he came over and talked with Nanimen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After talking about something, I can’t remember it. I vaguely remember some conversations that have been in love with each other, and I have thought of each other and have had several sides. After that, they exchanged their military resumes routinely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ear, only the former big pirate experienced a sea battle in the East, knowing that there is a place where the fleet is strong and can be lawless. Even the official navy of the Eastern Empire often raised the pirate flag to rob the innocent merchant ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a resurgence of the current situation in the mind of Naimen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fleet, like the Army, needs a lot of supplies, needs a dock, needs a sailor, and needs a military. This is a problem that pirates cannot solve, but the Navy must solve it. If the Navy cannot solve it completely, it will become a pirate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow of money has such a great magic: it can turn a piece of white land into the largest free port in the Far East Sea within twenty years, and use it to support the world’s largest An armed fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nelmen and Kazmi said goodbye to each other, and then watched him leave with the Marshal of the East. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I never thought that military spending would cause such a serious problem. Money, money, what exactly are you? Why is there a greater magic than magic? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence sighs exactly the keyword. The sapphire necklace, which is not in time, is always open in the mind of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Nanimen heard something that interest him. He took off the necklace and held it in his left hand, asking questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, Anne. What is the Central Bank?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not... "The voice seemed to want to say something at the beginning, but finally gave up, "the central bank is the bank of all banks." Its role is to maintain monetary stability and supply for the government, formulate and implement monetary policy, usually The Treasury is the final settler and final borrower of the banking sector..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is this. This is what he wants to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of details that he doesn't understand, but he understands the initial motivation for the establishment of this institution. Even after years of development and whitewashing in the future, the motive is still so obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus of that definition is of course not "maintaining currency stability," but "maintaining money supply." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intra is the most affluent republic. The problem is that we don’t have enough troops and officials to mobilize the potential on this land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Herald, please stay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistance quickly catches up with the belt The naval marshal who set about to go to the military and political meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since it is difficult for us to control all trade by force, why can't we think about it in reverse? We don't have to chase the smuggling boat across the ocean. Let the smuggling ship have to come to us. Why don't we set up a mandatory settlement bank so that we can master and mobilize the resources of Interre?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oriental stop Stepped down and turned around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A mandatory settlement bank? Similar to the money house... No, the institution of the Banknotes Division? This idea is a bit interesting."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can establish a bank with a mandatory bank. A bank responsible for clearing all banks, shipping insurance companies, tax and trade bank notes. The bank issued notes will be used to pay for our Taxes and military squads."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kezmi snorted: "What is the difference?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"There is a big difference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before hearing this sentence, the former pirate hurriedly closed his mouth - because answering this question is Marshal Wei Taiping himself. The Marshal of the Navy went to the side of the door and looked at the young man in front of him with a serious look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know the 'party whip', major?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Naval Marshal has suddenly changed topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door replied cautiously: "Slightly heard. It is the position responsible for supervising and implementing party discipline in all levels of parliament. It is the voting supervisor of the party." It is generally regarded as the second person below the party chairman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know how the party whip was born?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that it evolved from the young members who recorded the attendance and voting of the members. These members will distribute their salary and political support to their colleagues based on attendance and voting. Funds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Taiping nodded: "When the free country was just established, there was no strict party, only some have great influence. Members, like the Elf nobles, are intriguing each other and change their minds. It is from this simplest idea of ​​'statistical vote of the members of the parliament' that we have established a strong decision-making system that gives us strength, efficiency and money." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wei guessed the meaning of peace. With his understanding of the Marshal of the Navy, this person will directly express his conclusions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And what you are proposing now is the simple idea. Settle the bank of all banks. It will change our entire tax and debt system. If we want If you build such an institution, you can't have a lot of overseers. The liberal countries need not the general gendarmerie or the logistics staff, they need a person who can integrate all the potential war resources. Go and do it, take you The fleet is together. If necessary, take my fleet together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
