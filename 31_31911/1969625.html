The door that was awakened by the dialogue slowly released the hand that grabbed the pillow and woke up from a comfortable sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As usual when he woke up, he felt so weak and didn't want to move at all. He mobilized some paralyzed brain cells, only to recall that his body had at least three bullets: the peculiar sense of paralysis after the end of the healing spell on the right hand and left leg also reminded him of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few male voice conversations were kept coming into his ears - most of the voices he could recognize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Do you mean to make a deal?" The first voice was familiar. He had just talked to this person a few hours ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want the support of the entire Northern Army," the second person’s voice paused. "--As long as I do, I will not sue for treason." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first person’s tone became a bit strange when he heard this. "Oh? Do you want this Marshal badge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the military, no one does not want this marshal badge. However, to get the epaulettes, not only Need to have credit, more need to have the cost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, even if I speak, it may not be useful. The soldiers on the front line of the North need not my life, but Arrears of military supplies and supplies. Besides, your name is not yet passed to Steelburg, what can you get their support?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Military and supplies Soon there will be. As for the support... there will be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The South-West Army by the temporary patchwork, even if you get me The credit of this rebellious beheading is probably not enough to win the Marshal's badge. Betsy has been in the Eastern Army for 20 years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversation suddenly broke, silence For a moment. When I started again, I added another new old bass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you and me are guaranteed, it should be almost enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The table and chairs collided with the deck of the ship and made a harsh rubbing sound. It should be that someone has suddenly stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the case... I am doomed to fail, so you decided to support him? President Fox, your position has become really fast, it is worth it. The fox of Kengler."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I am a patriot." The newcomer slowly said, "I can't support your actions to split the Union. You will cooperate with us, Radz?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reseat the sound of sitting back on the stool. "If you don't accept it, it is treason... then I accept it. The Northern Army will hand it over to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Klad replied, "I I will do my best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to thank me. I am old, enough." Govar's voice sounded like a detachment of clergy. The tone, "I like my epaulettes, but I have already died for it once, I don't want to die again. This kind of army that robs each other, ambushes the inside, and fights for power, whoever wants to take over, will take over. Fox Marshal, I am sorry that I cannot reorganize the army you left behind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused Conti Fox screamed twice and did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the army that defends the country is in this situation, we should be determined to change it. If it is for the country, I don't mind killing it a few times." Germany is not answering, but is stating a belief. "I have already soiled my hand and I must succeed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it possible to rely on a dirty hand, can't build a pure fortress?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe. But before considering this issue, I have to reach the goal safely first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do they talk about such confidential topics in the ward? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until then, Nana was aware of the existence of this problem. He quietly opened his eyes, tilted his head and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a common sense medical room, small, full of sea tide smell, dim yellow oil lamp hanging on the ceiling and shaking. There are two beds and a table in the cabin, and there is no room for people to talk. There was only one girl sitting on the bed opposite him, and from his point of view she could barely see that she was wearing a red Intre Army uniform. Although he could not see his face, he knew that she must be the friend of Monica. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...Is there a place where the chiefs who are still here are going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He sat up with his left hand and asked her. The blond girl was taken aback and stuffed something into the military uniform pocket in a panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to use the only room that wouldn’t be disturbed by someone to do the monitoring... miscalculation. Put the receiver up first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie, who didn’t expect the teenager to wake up at this time, thought so quickly and quickly picked up the bug. She put her right leg down and returned to a lady's proper sitting position, asking Solitaire with concern: "You wake up. How do you feel about your right arm and left leg?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... except for some paralysis, it’s okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the door stopped in her military uniform pocket and quickly jumped Open, squatting on the right arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl leaned back slightly and leaned her head against the wooden wall, changing the subject: "Say, your self-first aid is quite good. If you don't use hemostasis Your arms and legs will probably be necrotic; if you use more advanced healing magic, the lead will remain in the muscles that are forcing healing, affecting the activity. These two conditions are difficult for the priest on this boat to cope with... You may have the potential to be a professional pastor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you know that it is a compliment, there are very few people who can reject the compliment of a pretty girl. The teenager laughed cautiously, and some of the questions he wanted to ask were also unsuccessful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, it's not so great, I just want to save valuable magical power for attack. Right, can I go down to the ground?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie took the teenager’s clothes from the hangers beside him and threw them in the chair. "The lead pellets have been taken out and should be fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He sat on the edge of the bed and tentatively stepped on the ground with his left foot. The irresistible numbness rushed straight into the brain from the heel. He rubbed his teeth and held the bed and stood up. Annie bored his eyes gazingly: he wasn't too strong, not too thin, not too tall, not too short, and the face that could be mixed in any crowd. It is very suitable to play a dragon suit with less than three shots in the costume war film, or to give the villain a second-level talent...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton noticed her The eyes suddenly burst into red, grabbed the clothes and began to wear panic. Annie smiled in understanding, lying down on the bed and turning her back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can answer my question now? Shouldn't you have to run away with 黛妮卡?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? Elope?! I don't know about this!" Nani was horrified and denied. "I haven't seen her again since that night!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The letter she sent back said that she is now taking risks with you. Since you are here, I dare not say how much the letter is true... probably she thinks you have Dead, in order to make the peace of mind for the loved ones, it is a good girl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyelids of the door are slightly moist. "It turns out to be like this... It's all my fault. I should write to her to explain. Are they naughty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, they are all Very good, I don’t have to raise your two big stomachs recently. The economy is also a lot more economical.” Anne decided not to mention her monthly donations. “They seem to be more intimate recently. Why, you want to go home. Have a look?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, this question is easy to say. I can accompany you to explain - I should still be a bit convincing." Because everything went well, Anne was very happy. "Yes, you sneak here is Lopez. General’s order?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager stood up in blue military pants and got up from the chair and replied: “How do you say... Coincidentally, Marshal Govar thought I was a fighting hero, and I acquiesced by default, earning the epaulettes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne stared at the huge shaking of his wall The shadow continues to ask: "Oh? So he still promotes your benefactor. You are also very great. In order to rob the merits, there is no future, there is a future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This sentence is like a heavy hammer, hitting the back of the door from the back. He stood up violently, his head hit the oil lamp hanging from the roof, and rushed forward, slamming his head and falling down on Anne's bed. The girl hurriedly shrank to the corner and gave him room to pounce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, are you okay? I just laughed, this reaction is too intense?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; However, Soledon never got up and seemed to be hurt by that sentence. Anne was at a loss, looking inside the pocket, looking for a stick to see him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What she didn’t know was that the teenager didn’t get up because of another completely different reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very suspicious. She is too suspicious. In her pocket, it must be a magic item for eavesdropping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time as waking up, Nanimen identified this matter. He didn't want to gossip, but he felt that he must seize this spy in his current position. He thought that he would not be fascinated by his former friendship - let alone the beautiful girl in front of him did not leave any good memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His almost all his actions are purposeful. He needs enough opportunity to let him steal the magic item from her pocket. This is not too difficult for a teenager who once put all his energy into the "survival" way. You must know that even his tried and tested teacher was successfully stolen by him. First, through the body language to induce the target to turn around, and then through the shadow of their own to block other shadows that may be leaked, and then use the exaggerated performance to distract the target's attention and create a close opportunity, and finally find a topic to let Anne no longer check The item is just fine--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the problem is in the moment of success. There is more than one thing in Anne's pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the touch of the finger, he knows that there is a huge rectangular metal object, a leather bag that is much larger than the palm, and a small one. Oval glass items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which one to take? As a thief, there is no choice. He can only choose to hide easily. He took out the small round glass item and pinched it in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--At the last moment, he glanced at the thing: it was a blue oval gemstone pendant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he lost consciousness. To be exact, it is almost absorbed by the thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the magic is like water, the magician is the river that guides the water, and the general magical item is the lake where the water is temporarily stored, then the pendant is the ocean. The ocean without water. The river flows to the mouth of the sea, waiting for the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This humble pendant may have been a powerful magic item before, but it is now empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has never seen, never heard of, or even imagined a magical item with such a large volume. Compared to the humble pendant, the structure of other magic items he has seen is extremely ridiculous. What was the power, in this tiny sapphire pendant? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, but Nami believes that this abyss is not terrible in the face--and on the other hand. He stood at the mouth of the river and tried to take a step forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world is unfolding in front of his eyes. The horizon stretches into oceans, land, and mountains, and it can be vaguely seen as the shape of a world map, but with a higher precision than all the world maps he has ever seen. It is difficult to see the end of everything. I only know that the sky is above my head and the earth is at my feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overlapping texts are deeply engraved on the blue-blue crystal ocean floor, overlapping each other and swallowing each other. The tide of words and scenes poured into his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the owner, former owner, and former owner of this great magical item, those who fight between life and death, in ideals and reality The mark left by the people who fought and struggled between different minds. I don’t know how many years of engraving, I used these words to engrave this ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the thoughts, knowledge, and beliefs that are piled up in endless words. Although those arguments and spells overlap and overlap each other, he is surprised to find that he can read it out, just like there is a silent resonance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Magic was once considered a gift of the gods and the well-being of the people, and was once considered a tool of the accomplices and ambitions of the powers. I have repeated I have thought about why there is a spell and what its origin is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are reason and belief, nature and sacrifice, blood and music - all incredible The principle of casting and the means of implementation record the sum of all super magic techniques and anti-magic techniques. Such a simple wording is written at the top of the seamount, which is composed of thousands of units of magic divided by different systems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The original of the spell is not a prayer, not a spell, not a gift, not a blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He subconsciously meditation, seems to be able to feel the mood and belief of the magician who wrote these words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Swords and horses give military aristocracy a power, which is for a hierarchical society. Gunpowder and education give civilians equality, which is for a free society. Magic, It is for the purpose of guarding the mind, and I fight for it to call myself a magician. First for the thinker, then for the magician. Arcane is the blade of reason and faith, and the magic is the shield of morality and faith."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young magician repeats what he has written in these other spaces and bows his head. He has no ideals and no faith. He did not pursue, he has given up. He is not mature enough to become a worldly one. He thinks that he is already a real person, but he has always been to survive and follow the trend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed his head numbly, trying to avoid these so-called, too idealistic words, but saw the pillars that supported these words. That is three short sentences that are repeatedly stacked together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"thoughtsource". "knowledgeskill". "faithstrength". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought is the source. Knowledge is skill. Faith is power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the name of the payment is...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wake up! Wake up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager did not see the name of the payment. In the meantime, he heard a sweet voice calling, and the feeling of attraction instantly receded. He felt extremely tired, like the feeling of disengagement after using all the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening his eyes, he saw the blonde girl pulling out the pendant from his palm. The cute and neat tooth prints on the index and middle fingers that have been opened are visible, and the hardships of this process can be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry. I mistakenly thought it was a bug..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sordenton numbness Apologize, showing a stiff smile. His eyes still shrouded a blue, and memories of the past battle, the eloquence of the weekdays disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie did not feel it, just holding the sapphire pendant. She looked at it with a gentle look, revealing a happy smile, bowed her head and gently kissed it. After collecting this once magical item into the inner pocket of the military uniform, she began to consider how to be rehabilitated. There are many different ideas in her mind, from nervousness, shock, confusion, struggle to calm. If she was a month ago, she would not hesitate to use magic to clear his memory; but now she will not do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No blame, no contemptuous eyes, no swearing. Anne just stared at the boy's eyes quietly and raised a question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
