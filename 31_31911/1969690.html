Solitton remembered that at this time of the day, he seemed to be on this road too, and the streets seemed to be equally silent. But after a night, the situation has been completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpses and weapons scattered around prove the tragic fire of last night. The bodies of civilians, free soldiers, Lenni militia and Imperial Invaders were scattered throughout the streets, and almost every street had traces of fierce gun battles and hand-to-hand combat. Some of the bodies of the two armies have been wrapped up in shrouds, but they have not been able to be transported. Almost all roadblocks and fortifications have been razed, and the roads are full of ruins left by explosions and destruction of magic. The main roads made of hard slate are now everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most striking is the columns of smoke that represent the fire. The fighting between the two armies ignited many houses, and the emperor ruined every warehouse that could be found in case the Free Army used these materials again. These columns burned all night and stretched down the street to the end of the distant city. In the remaining areas, the two areas with the largest area and the most hoarding materials, the East Third District and the North Third District are the most concentrated places of these plumes – which also reflects the silence of the East Third District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows why it is so quiet here. The two armies have almost smashed the organized troops, and the last precious troops are used to ensure the retreat. At the beginning, the emperor smashed the main force of the Freedom Army, which was deployed in the East Third District, and tens of thousands of free soldiers and militiamen here were broken. The Free Army was dispersed into scattered teams of all sizes, covering the people in the area and fighting back, but still suffered extremely heavy losses. Next, the emperor re-enacted this process. Their main force was also defeated, dispersed, and pursued by the remnants of the Free Army. Now the main battlefields of the two armies have been transferred to the north and south of the city. The Free Army must ensure a retreat to the Nancheng Port Area, while the Emperor wants to protect the logistics warehouses in the various areas of the North City. No one has spared no effort to continue fighting in the East Third District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blond girl who leaned on his chest complained in a low voice: "I can’t touch people anymore. What should we do with our record? It’s hard to conceive Ok, if you can't pass the Marshal Fox, you will lose money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The report should not be worried. We have achieved such a big victory, still With these two spoils, who can tamper with our credit? Who can dare to snatch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door smiled and pointed at the saddle Said two magic weapons. The "benevolentness" of one of the seven swords of virtue is already amazing, but the other one is even more amazing: it is the "power" of the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time in history that a free soldier has encountered this weapon - no, this is even the first time in history that an enemy with an empire got this Handle weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not enough. We don’t need more than just a battle report. We need a legend. **, violence, refreshment, and the story is nothing more than these. Something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Anne’s answer, Ninmen said from the heart: "I feel that you are already very legendary, Anne. Free Times Go crazy and chase you to give you an exclusive interview."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her art-like figure is left with only one right hand is intact, left The lower left arm and both legs have been cut off by the sharp edge, and then the deep black crystal buckles on the fracture of the limb, and the side of the crystal is sealed with a blood-stained bandage. This kind of injury is even a man, but it is also a terrible injury - not to mention such a charming blonde beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow the truth? I don't think about it." Annie snorted and licked him with his left hand. "Everyone will definitely ask the question, 'You are How do you suffer from such a heavy injury?? Do you want me to tell them that they were bitten by the dying military minister? I don’t want to spread this shameful thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Of course. I don't want to let the morale of the emperor recover because of this battle." Anne interrupted him. "Fortunately, almost no one saw it in the war. Just change some details." For example, the enemy is not just a military minister. From the emperor, the prime minister, the military minister, the security minister, the foreign minister, the court magec, and so on, all in the army, and despicablely set traps to besiege me."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the emperor escaped." Nanimen gradually mastered Anne’s thoughts. "In other words, he can’t deny this rumor, or he will escape this more shame. The secret will be exposed. The process of winning these few people is definitely more exciting..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne’s forehead slammed into his chest: "Who If you want to win, you have to lose. The strongest forces of the empire are assembled, and I must be defeated and captured. The ability and ambition to raise the enemy is to elevate ourselves, or the demon king and tyrant recorded in the history books. Do you want to conquer the world? Can you show us the hardships and hard work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...what if you lose, how can you edit it?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne bowed her head and looked at her legs and said, "Then it is natural to show the cruelty and despicableness of the enemy. By the way, add some elements of the legendary story. In order to understand my magic. The secret, the emperor and his arrogant aristocrats can only choose to torture to reduce my willpower, thus ensuring that their spiritual magic can be effective. Anyway, there are many senior magicians in the empire, and their yellow ** should be a lot, from those The most sensational story is picked up - you should have seen a lot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the door became red: "I have never seen it. I am sure that the aristocrats are ridiculous and ridiculous!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That’s the beginning when you talk about this part, tears on your eyes Well, the rich imagination of men will naturally work. With two legs and one arm, there are many patterns that can be played. However, there are some tricks that may not have been thought of now.” Anne seems to think of something, close to the door of the door. “Of course, you have to remember a few basic tricks, just in case someone suddenly asks to wear it. Let's start with the left foot..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annies lowered her voice, but she could hear her high interest. She worked hard to compile the story of herself being tortured by the imperial aristocracy in various ways - in which each of her legs was "used" at least three times. The [哔-] methods that dealt with her hands and feet sounded like a door-to-door creep, and the sour water turned up from his stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...just do it, and shape the dead military minister into an accomplice of the conscience, and the living guys are more violent than an evil. The emperor must If you want to laugh at the evil spirits, you can play with bloody bones and listen to my screams. You should not have to talk about it again? This kind of story can be remembered again. If you sell it to 'these' booksellers, Can you sell a lot of money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really want to forget about it...this is really a story that can only be circulated underground. I bet the North and the South. The booklet will be banned." Namimen sighed. "I am starting to really hate these savage aristocrats."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gaze I couldn’t stop looking at Anne’s broken limb, moving from my arm to my leg and moving back. Anne’s torture story was like a virus in her mind, making him feel like this scene really happened. How can she make up the "that kind" story of her own role as a heroine so easily? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was distracted, the horseshoe suddenly stepped on a broken brick, and the horse leaned and slammed toward the side of the stone wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was shocked and stunned, and quickly pulled the horse back to the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sudden shock made Anne, who was barely sitting on the saddle, scream, and her body, which lacked her legs to balance, almost slipped. Anne's only left hand was holding the door, and the rest of the left arm barely stuck his right waist. The whole person was almost wrapped around the door, and the unfortunate incident was avoided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde girl whispered in a flush: "Damn! Doesn't this make me let him take advantage of it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen heard this sentence, biting his lip and pretending it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, compared to the soft touch in front of him, the cold crystal touch on the waist makes him more uncomfortable. No matter how ridiculous the story is, it is always a fact that she has only one right hand left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may sound reasonable, but Naimen still feels that something is wrong: "Can't say that. We sacrificed so many people, but also because they are not interesting enough to make some ecstasy stories?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the strategy is necessary, of course. The death of the average person is only statistics, and the death of some people can become a tragedy." Anne's answer is categorical," If you let me choose the law of death that will pass on to future generations, I must choose the rarest and most tragic one. I must feel fearful, moved, or excited when everyone mentions my name. It depends on what I want. The final result is achieved. You can certainly count this strategic value, and bear the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unlucky topic makes the door to be speechless. He has seen too many colleagues who died as statistics - he really does not want to die as silently as they do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head hard and pulled the subject back: "If you only say value, the effect of this story is really 'attractive'. If you count hidden 'Li Edition', no one on the mainland did not know the story within a month. What else should I change later?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie thought about it , replied: "No need. The last part, from the secret of the legendary magic you found until the final charge repels all the enemy and the emperor's part, it is true. It is too much to be suspected." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The change is not too big..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is closed and the eyes are modified After the whole battle process was repeated in my mind, suddenly woke up and understood Anne's true intentions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, Anne. The uninformed person who listened to this story would think that it is me who beat the emperor and killed the military minister."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." Annie looked up and gave him a look. "The heroine in the popular story should not rely on his own strength to win, no matter how powerful he is, It’s not so cute to wait for the hero to fight and rescue her. The first battle is to set off the victory. I can’t resolutely don’t want this help in the second battle.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne interrupted him again and again: "Where is it?" More, but you are my superior in the Western Army? Is this a great achievement? If you can't get this credit, how can you continue to be my superior, Naomi? Soledon Captain Shang?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few problems like the guns that made the door endless. He slowed down Ma, and stammered his argument: "Just, even if I don't take your credit, should there be other ways for us to continue to fight together?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie grabbed his clothes and slammed her body forward, looked up and let her Look straight into his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example...such as...for example..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we don't do the boss and the subordinates What else can you do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She exposed her power and became the hero of the hero, the mainstay of the Free Army. And he is still a small combat staff, and may be promoted one or two levels. To maintain the relationship of the past, we can only follow her script, unless...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a bold and incredible thought in his mind. But he was immediately vetoed by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is not acceptable. Absolutely not. That is an idea that he may never be qualified to raise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example...such as... for example... sorry. I can’t think of it. Just follow this script."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne smiled with satisfaction: "I will say it. We have two credits. We should have thought about the usage of these two credits. Then we only need to find someone who passes the order." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said, twisted her head and went to the Free Army advance troops that might exist in a certain corner. The invisible Eye of Magic flew up from her shoulder and ran along the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he can no longer continue to observe her eyes, because she has already cheered up: "I found it! Turn left in front, a little roundabout, there is a cavalry squad! With two captives!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistance to the door and a horse, turned over. There was a team of more than 20 free army cavalry, who were advancing from west to east. When I saw Nami and Anne's horse, the whole team almost arrested the horse at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people put their hands on their pistols, but they were immediately angered by their companions: "It’s your own! You don’t know the two of the Western Army. "Hello?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gall...Hello?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this is usually only used The title of the commander of the general class, the door to the whole body feels a discomfort, just like wearing a uniform that is completely unfit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander of the cavalry saw him ask, thinking that he was the fault of his own newcomers, snorted angrily and again loudly ordered: " You rabbits, these two were the heroes who saved the entire Lenni army last night! The special commander of the Western Army! The first mage of the Free Army, known as the "Free Saint", Ms. Sefer and organized Heroes of the East Third Zone slamming the battle against the door? Lord Soledon! Hurry and salute! Even a good ceremony is not good, no wonder you have lost the roll and climb, if you stay on the front line, how can you recognize two of you! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, I am not..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a bit fat, and some words The commander also respected a military ceremony: "Oh, in fact, I participated in the blockade of the East Third District last night, deeply impressed by your courage and commanding ability! Of course, like a small person like me, you may not remember to live, let I will introduce myself again first. I am the Lieutenant of the Tenth 'Lenny' Freedom Division, now directing the East Third District. The independent Rangers scouted the Emperor's movements... Ah, sorry, I said so much nonsense. The two of you are back, it must be the first triumph!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The door nodded noddedly: "Okay..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other cavalry behind him suddenly exclaimed: "Your saddle is hanging Is the golden scepter a 'power'?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door nodded again: "Yes, just the emperor..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before he finished explaining, Lieutenant Lu Ge was already excited and shivering. He jumped from the horse and went straight to the horse in front of the door. He burst into tears and shouted: "The emperor is finally dead! The gods bless! Long live freedom! Long live the two! Long live! Long live! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have been infected by the sergeant, and the entire team of free cavalry also jumped out of the horse, all eyes with tears, at the door of the horse I smashed the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the door is stopped in the air, I don’t know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, he was sitting next to another very smart and powerful passenger. Annie deliberately "snapped" and closed her eyes and leaned heavily against the shoulders of the door, pretending to faint and dispelling him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lu hot looked up and immediately noticed the horror of the "small petite" lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes wide open, just like the eyeballs can jump out of the eyelids at any time: "Lord of the Virgin...this...this is how Serious injury! What did the empire's beasts do to her! Sir, there is a fish that slips through the net! If there is still, please be sure to give it to us, even if we put on life, no, even put on the entire Lenny Army , will also avenge the Lord Sefer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nelity finally caught the opportunity to say a whole sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Lizhong, please be quiet, Lieutenant Sefer has passed out, listen to me before the front line. First of all, the emperor did not Dead, we are catching up with the enemy battalion in the East 4th District. The commander of the enemy is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, the door suddenly paused He is hesitating whether he wants to perform according to Anne's script. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne immediately noticed this, and in his ear he snorted again, his right hand slammed him and twisted. Resist the door and took a sigh of relief, and had to go back to the script -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Well, please ask everyone to report this battle report to Marshal Fox. Please forgive me for not being able to rush, and Lieutenant Saphir’s injury is almost out of date."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Hot Lieutenant wiped his tears and snots with his cuffs. He has been completely convinced by this ups and downs. "I will follow your military order. If it is not your order, I will definitely bring my brother." Let's go rushing for a while! As long as we can't bring back the head of the imperial emperor Gustav's mixed ball, we will never return to Lenny! Please rest assured that after we informed the Lord Fox and the whole army, the whole lun The Nigerian army, no, the entire Free Army will be yours for the Lord's lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned over, whistled, turned the horse's head, ordered Your own men: "Get on the horse! This battle report can't wait for a second, get off!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lieutenant next to him is not so anxious, but Nanimen raised another question: "Excuse me... Is it necessary to go to the hospital with Lord Sefer? Indeed, all the senior priests of the Freedom Army have been dereliction of duty, and even if they have not been dereliction of duty, they will be cured. This nearby can cure this kind of injury. "People?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen thought and cautiously replied: "You don't have to worry, there is a way to the St. Grace Welfare Institute."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welfare Home...I seem to have seen it." The little frown frowned and stopped talking. "My troops had a fierce neighborhood near that last night." Fight. Hey, sorry for a lot of things... I wish you all the best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lieutenant turned his head and looked in the direction of the welfare home. With his sight, Nanimen found that there were indeed two or three faint columns of smoke in that direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An ominous premonition immediately caught his heart. He couldn’t attend the farewell to the team’s guerrilla cavalry and turned and set off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All ominous premonitions and joke-like words are connected to form a path to hell, full of flags representing death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be no problem. The secret base of the top mage will not be so easily destroyed, right? - Benben wants to ask this easily. But I don't know why, these questions can't be asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Anne who actively tried to comfort him: “It’s okay. There are no important goals in the welfare homes that will not be destroyed. They can’t always take the entire welfare home. Burned?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Nami can feel what she has been worried about. The girl who only has one arm to maintain balance has no ability to cover up her body language. She must hold the clothes of the door to stop on the horse. She can even feel the tremor of her fingertips. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Goddess of fate, you should stop making this kind of malicious joke at the end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Nanmen repeatedly prayed in his heart, speeding up his speed again and again. Every time I rushed through a street, the column of smoke was closer, almost exactly the same position in his memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he still holds the last hope, until this hopes to smash in the face of reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrance to the welfare home is wide open, and the doorway is full of broken rubble and rubbish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the two iron-clad rafts was donated by Clade Lopez, and now there is a drop, and the other has a huge hole. Dropped on the street outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not the source of the smoke column, the main chapel of the welfare home. Resist the door and let go of the reins, let the horse jump over the rubble and stop in front of the Welfare Court chapel - the building that burned only the black wooden beams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Is this a dream? It must be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is instinctively looking around Around, look for clues that can be used in dream analysis. This thing he did when he dreamed the night before, he was very skilled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the key point? If the key point is 'home is burned', it probably symbolizes the abandonment of past memories..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come on, Annie. Why are you still not jealous? I have said this to the point, why are you still not taking it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man bowed his head and did not see the familiar smile that was expected to be with a natural smile. Anne Seifer was staring at the ruin, staring blankly, and seemed to be smashing something in her mouth. Her voice is too small, and the door can only barely hear a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the power of history? When all fates become enemies, the spring's recoil is really strong..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door reached out and clumsily swayed in front of Anne’s eyes. He is not very good at these active atmospheres. As usual, whether in Lenny, in the staff, or on the battlefield, Anne is doing these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That, I don’t think there’s any dead here, Anne. Look, there’s no body? I’ve brought the teacher, he and the nun should have spent now. The Matterby River, the children have been evacuated earlier. Besides, haven’t they burned, you see that the former hospitals I used to live in are nothing...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;These comfort words that came out are all facts, but all of them dryly circumvent the most important problems. Naomi’s talent for finding out that he has no active atmosphere at all is incomparable to a girl who can find a smile from the fact that she has broken her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, that would be great." Annie finally came back and hung up her little smile, "This is my script." There is no need to change too much. Just a few heroines can still continue to play..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without warning, she passed out Resistant to the shoulder of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A little heroine? Hey, hey, what's the matter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hold her tightly and shake it, but I can't get a response anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***-***-***-***-***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Grace Welfare Institute on August 9, 1669 (mday+130)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***-***- ―***——***-***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a rusty lock and iron on the door of each room in the side yard. The chain looks like it hasn't been opened for a long time. Nanimen did not know where the nun found such an old lock, but it looked quite effective, and the room did not seem to have been looted by the passing soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was jumped off the horse, kicked the door of his room, rushed in, and put the faint Anne on his bed. The girl who lost her legs can only occupy half the length of the bed; without complicated eyes and varied expressions, she looks like a doll in the coma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never realized that a woman’s personality and beliefs would have such a strong influence on her appearance. When Annie was the strongest magician in the world, she was the beautiful god's electorate when she was broken; when she was in a coma, it seemed to be a helpless disabled girl, temperament, charm and so on. All the tempting qualities follow her. The mind left the little torso. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Smell the salt... Damn, all took it away. Spirits... I didn't have it here. Military mint cream..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is touched by the inner pocket of his military uniform. It is empty. He glanced at Anne's dirty military uniform with blood and mud, and shook his head. Even if she had it, it would have long since expired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where can I find it? My spare equipment bags and military uniforms are not here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The door of the door stayed on the other red female officer uniform on the table. Everything in this room is the same as when he left yesterday, and the military uniform left by Renee seems to be quite complete. He grabbed his clothes, took a lot of things off the table, pulled the front shackles, pulled out the mint cream in a small metal box from the inner pocket, and wiped it in front of Anne's nostrils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful peppermint is very effective, and Anne’s breath is immediately rushing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She recognized the speed so fast that the door was a little surprised: "Annie, have you been to my room? When?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, no, I didn't come. I have been squirming in bed. It seems that I want to sit up, but I can't make it. "I just think that you are the kind of man who will bring the fainted girl back to his room, right? Chief?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie is still trying to laugh, but the door is no longer laughing. He just "hmm", squatting down and picking up the debris that had just been swept to the ground, and didn't want Anne to see his present expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say, this is my first time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this In other words, the door is almost slipping to the ground. Annie chuckled and added: "Don't be wrong, I mean, this is the first time I have come to a man's room. What do you think is the first time, endurance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The topic has not returned to the right track - or, no one wants Let the topic go back to the heavy track. The doorkeeper noticed the red brooch box and smashed from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the time I was in high school, I have been imagining what kind of man the first man who invited me to his room would be, that would be What kind of invitation, what kind of room would it be. Unfortunately, I have never had a man, this fantasy has not been realized. I like my man, I mostly don't like it, I like the man, but there is no room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie said as she continued to sit up and work hard. She held the bed with her only elbow, slipped, supported the bed, and slipped, until she tried to lift her body a little for the third time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At that time, I thought that the inviter would be a strange and handsome young man. The appearance is slightly older than me, with a charming mysterious charm. He is not necessarily Very rich or very powerful, but it can make people feel his strong self-confidence and extraordinary ability, it should be a powerful magician. Our acquaintance may be from an accident, the fate of the shackles connect us together It should be a well-considered, well-planned invitation, a room key that quietly stays on the table after a successful date, leading to a messy but full of owner’s interest and ambition. And the room with hobby marks. The room should have several complete sets of research equipment, dense bookshelves, sticky notes everywhere and security devices that can withstand any attacks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Resist the door while listening to Annie's words, while opening the brooch box. It was originally sent to Anne Sefir by the nun, but it was sent to the nicknamed nienick. It was this brooch that disturbed Monica’s mood and changed her identity. The adventure brought the emperor from the tunnel and opened this magnificent day. I don't know why, he leaned slightly and didn't let Anne notice the little box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At that time, I definitely can't think of the ultimate realization of this goal? I will lose two legs and one arm, and then at a full depth. In a coma, the young heterosexual boss broke into his bed as a piece of meat and threw it on the bed. What should be the beginning? Hunting? Department of tyranny? [哔] Toilet system? [哔] Toys? [哔] Slavery?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door finally couldn’t help but squirt out and cough. Many of the proper nouns in Annie's words were first heard when Anne just wrote the story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, you, what are you talking about! I don't understand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie I finally gave up the effort to sit up and smile. I leaned on the pillow and smiled and said, "I don't understand? The latter ones are all right. Can you understand the front? The invention of modern printing has four...two hundred For many years, you haven't bought a yellow book? Who believes? If my activities are convenient, I can definitely pull out the yellow book in this room - maybe I can edit a yellow book directory?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, really not! If you have the spare money, I would rather buy more magazines or materials! The magician's study costs a lot of money..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, the sound of the door is getting smaller and smaller. Annie sharply grasped this: "Is there really nothing? Never seen it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is a rented book..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Buy to see and sell second-hand, probably also... Hey, Annie, can we change the subject?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde girl is weak and "hehe" After laughing two times, I agreed: "Okay. Then let's talk about the female officer's uniform on the ground. How about? I want to say that the suit looks a bit familiar. My size, right? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the door quickly slammed into the ground, and immediately received it back: "This, this military uniform is, is..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, um, keep editing, sir? Layton sir?" Annie’s smile was a bit stunned. "This is my first time." When I come to the man's room, it will start at the beginning. How can the follow-up development be the story of the super-expansion system? The first time I entered the man's room, there will be a follow-up to the rape. I am really a woman who can't help it... It seems to be in the air. I saw the choice of flying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...this, this military uniform is really not ! Imagine "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; uniforms is Dai Nika stay, but this is too complicated to say it right. Naimen didn't have the confidence and the mood to explain this thing clearly... but Anne has already started firing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first possibility. This military uniform is taken out of my luggage. You are not far away to bring this suit to Lenny. Even if it has been through hard work, it has not left for a moment. From this point of view, you are really the spirit of the real magicians, the chief of the underwear thief?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Although the whole brain is worried about the "real topic", and hearing this kind of ignorance, the doorman still feels that he can't keep silent: "We have been fighting together for a whole night. You can see where I can hide. A whole set of uniforms!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie's right hand swayed and erected a second finger: "So the possibility two. The uniform is Lenny's local. You one When I arrived in the round, I became a hero of the Free Army. I immediately went around to find a glamorous female officer to hook up. I can prove that you have never touched a woman in the months of Steelburg or even Jena, so come back. Lennie wants to vent the animal desires and feels good. As the youngest in the history of the fresh ** The winner, the mouthful of the singer, the singer, the sergeant, the sergeant, the hook, the beauty officer, and of course it is also very easy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The combat plan must also pay attention to the basic rationality Ah, Safir’s staff, is the beautiful officer left naked in my room?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful analytical skills and adaptability of the door The role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay. It's really tenacious..." Annie frowned and smiled harder. "Possibility III! You were half a year ago, or even more Early, I made this uniform according to my size! No, maybe not only military uniforms, but also maids, nurses, magic women, Dongyi and even underwear, etc., just waiting for the end of the war. I returned to Lenny with a veteran allowance and retired as the head of the perverted sergeant! I returned to Lenny yesterday morning, only to feel the fire, and turned back from the street to an innocent rogue for your new chapter of excellence. Lenny's call to the heroes to change the abuse! The box you hold in your hand must be the evidence... Ha, ha, definitely!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of such a large series of cannons, Anne has been a bit out of breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That...not really what you think. Long talk, this brooch should have belonged to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door smiled reluctantly and handed the box over. The blonde girl took it with suspicion, and the right index finger of the right hand opened the lid. She is stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give Anne? Sefer", that says on the note. It is the handwriting of the nun, but Anne does not know. Her face was red and her body shook back to the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It won't be said... Is that military uniform also... a gift that would have been given to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misunderstanding, misunderstanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Of course, this truth will not be said if the mouth is torn away. He just picked up the red officer uniform from the ground, took off the soil above, and slowly placed it on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie took the brooch out of the box. Not too good material, but she still went to the clothes. It was difficult for her to complete the work with only one hand. She repeatedly inserted it several times and could not insert the thick Brib of the military uniform. Instead, the needle was stabbed on the thumb of the right hand and stabbed the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is close to the bed and asks: "Do you want to help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie Nodded. "Of course. However, your question is very stupid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was taken over by the brooch and lowered his head to find the most suitable position. Anne's plump chest pulled a beautiful bevel on the chest of her military uniform. He carefully dropped his hand in the air and avoided the fascinating twin peaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there really no way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He inserted his brooch into a bloody military uniform On the silver surface, the bloody scent is also stained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably yes." Annie whispered, "The heroine of the script... I can only resign. Fortunately, I have finished the first Curtain, the second act can be continued as long as the plot is changed. It is also good to live in the legend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But that is your credit... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne smiled again. In her smile this time, she couldn’t feel even a little angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For us, don't say credit, even the body, it's also something outside. This body is finally over, don't care." If you really want to touch it, just touch it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman shook, and the brooch almost poked on his finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He panicked his brooch, his hand bounced off Anne’s chest and pulled back to the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am serious. Don't say touch, what do you want to do? Here is your room, I am your [哔-] Or [哔-] or [哔-]...... The name is not important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie said in a calm tone that some future publications will The vocabulary that was blocked, "It’s the last anyway, really what you can ask for."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was stunned and shook his head: "Are you sure?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annies turned her head and nodded hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is still not convinced. He jerked up, turned and bowed his head, almost looking at Anne's eyes at zero distance, confirming for the third time in a word: "Can you really do anything? Any request?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne put her hand on her forehead, slowly closing her eyes, shortness of breath stand up. Her face was finally occupied by the tide red, and her fingers had been unconsciously fiddling with her hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This beautiful gesture is so tempting. Naimen felt that there was a malicious demon in the depths of his heart that was sprouting, growing, growing, and unbeatable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon is whispering in his ear: Fast, this is the last chance. For a beautiful girl who has never had a tomorrow and lost her last resistance, what are you waiting for? No matter how difficult it is to be tolerated, no matter how difficult it is, you can do it. If you miss this opportunity, you will never have it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this voice is winning. He must make the request, the request that has been lingering in the depths of his heart for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be a request that she couldn’t imagine, and she was shocked and cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door took a deep breath: "So, I have a request, please be sure to give me an honest answer."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
