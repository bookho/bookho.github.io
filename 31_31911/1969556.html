			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been a long time to sail. The ship was last replenished with water and fresh vegetables in the Tarn Islands and then did not cross the shore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea is generally calm, but sometimes the wind is very big. It is fickle and irritable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leisha; Hermonte looks at the sea every day on the side of the ship, breathing the air with a taste of the ocean. The musty smell inside the cabin is too heavy, and it is very uncomfortable to stay for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza hates the cabin. She still remembers that when she fled her hometown to the New World three years ago, her own seasickness was very dizzy: in the cabin from the beginning to the end, smelling bad smell. That time, she almost died under the Oceanic Syndrome -- the so-called "even the pope is not well treated." There are countless pioneers who died of this disease, and it took a long time for medical scientists to isolate many of the components of the disease. If the ship's pastor used her magical powers and holy water to hang her life, she might have been thrown into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this voyage is different. Life on the boat is fresh and interesting every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every morning, set up a beep to wake up and climb up to see the stars melt in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every morning, sitting leisurely in the bow to see the sea, by the way, using activated rods and frost bombs to fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, prepare lunch in the kitchen and sailors to help them make some materials that are not available at sea for a variety of dishes. For example, you can make the seaweed look like a cabbage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the afternoon was calm, take the Golden Devil to the aft deck to do alchemy experiments, and by the way, study the new things that were made last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, help the sailors to fish the seaweed and use these seaweeds to convert into planks and materials for the next day to repair the ship. After seeing the astrology every night, I went to the United States to enter the dreamland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailors can see the golden figure every day, and this figure may appear in every corner of the ship. These sailors are very amiable to her, and are completely different from the rude and savage sea men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She likes this "Kleon Emperor" and the crew above it - she feels that she may fall in love with sailing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This afternoon, she stayed in the room as usual, adjusted a few bottles of potion, tested several new recipes, pondered the improvement of the Golem, and played The last seized object. At the center of the mirror are two huge spots of light that are almost overlapping, and some stars scattered in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that sailing is not a terrible thing. If you can keep going this way, it’s not bad..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she is actually the only one who thinks so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No... not a storm, but it is not calm..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bow, sniffing the subtle feelings of the sea breeze. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like other people with elder bloodlines - or elves with human descent, Leonard's physical age is much higher than the apparent age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that he is only in his early twenties and has 40 years of sailing experience. Experience, and talent, let him have a keen sense of pressure - although, in this era, people do not know what the concept of pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, after all, I still don't fully master the ability to change the wind. Can only be done by birds?" He laughed at himself. That being said, he has not encountered such an undetermined situation for at least a year or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night has begun to fall, and a new logbook has been recorded on page 14 and another day has passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he is very upset - not just for the weather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, I will report it to the captain. But I have to explain in advance that the lady is a resident mage. You must not arbitrarily or privately rumor. If she is discovered by her, I don't know what will happen. You are all my important subordinates. I don't want to lose. You should do your own thing first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling this afternoon's conversation, Leonard used His hat covered his face and sighed. I had to deal with it at the time, but until now he did not know how to deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s easy to say that she is more important than others, but responsibility is not so easy to abandon. Ignore the dissatisfaction of his subordinates, he can't do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there a way to get them to live together..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His left hand pink finger unconscious The ground hits the guardrail; as long as he is nervous, he will repeat this action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From a human perspective, the elves and half-elf men have more or less such sissy problems. Young elves and half-elves are mostly educated in a purely female environment until adulthood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let’s talk to the captain, let’s talk about the storm...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The half-elves hesitated for a long time before they made up their mind. The captain of this ship is a very difficult person; and his relationship with him is very cold and stiff. From the class point of view, the captain of the sea corps is not directly governed by the captain, and is the second-highest person on board... but Leonard does not want to have any conflict with the captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like most elf sailing ships, the captain of this ship is a pure elf. A serious, elegant, long-lived pureblood elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become the captain of the Elf anti-private ship "Kleon Emperor", Ferron; Fearon Letensti first class baron as a ship The long ability can definitely rank among the top 20 in the two sea fleets. He was originally the elite of the first offshore fleet and was transferred to work with the completion of this new ship. As far as the elves are concerned, he is still in the age of arrogance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "first class" prefix on his baron's title proves that this title was exchanged for excellence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the loss of Saneti Fegner in 1453, Sansen has been keen on reform in the system of knighthood. Only the title obtained by the meritorious service is the first-class and second-class titles. The title that can be inherited can only be the quasi-caled position, and the meritorious service can be “turned positive”. Only those who have first-class titles can enter the core of the Sanctuary Power Pyramid; those who are the princes of the ranks can only receive annuities in their own territories. Although the specific title is only the Baron--the second-ranked baron in the six-level system of the Elf Gong Houzizi male honour, but by looking at this "first-class" prefix, you know Feilong; Captain Leutsti is not Incompetent generation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a typical captain of the offshore fleet, and he has nothing to do with the military discipline. Even if it is similar to purchasing supplies, distributing water, and so on, he often has to supervise himself. In the offshore fleet, the baron’s nickname is “The Iron Wall Admiral Ferron”. The literal meaning is that his defense is as strong as the iron wall; the actual meaning is that he must be too wide-handed, no matter what little things can not miss his wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These little things, including the last time Leonard accepted the actor as a shipmaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, the relationship between the two became very cold... although it was originally very cold. Thinking of the tension between the two, Leonard’s head hurts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pure Blood Elf and Half Elf. He has served as the commander of the captain for a long time and the practical bureaucrat who climbed up on the basis of actual performance. The commander of the offshore fleet who is concerned about class discipline and the sailors of the distant sea fleet who are accustomed to freedom. The highest officer at the headquarters airborne and the deputy chief on behalf of the local staff...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about it, it is inevitable that the relationship between the two people is not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last thing has become like this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the volume is a little bigger, Le Baron Dunsti can be included in the ranks of the most outstanding captains of Sansen... The half-elf is thinking without regret, wearing a hat and brave the courage to go to the captain's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half elf took a deep breath and pushed the door open. Seeing that the captain was eating, he only reacted to dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry to bother you when you eat, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes Leonard Ah. Is there anything? In addition to business, you will not come to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fallon; Leton Stieti elegantly put down the plate Lenard smiled awkwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a few rusks and two pieces of bacon in the plate, and a little green vegetables. These vegetables are also cultivated on board, and it is thanks to the alchemist's culture solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard hesitated and thought about how to word it. His inner contradiction is fully reflected in his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is like this, that...our sailor, recently dissatisfied with the elements of a disturbing job... well, no, it should be said that it is Leisha; The daily behavior of Miss Hermonte has caused us some trouble... Well, no..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please tell me in the simplest words?" The Iron Wall Admiral interrupted him politely and resolutely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. In a nutshell, the sailors complained that the Missing Master, Miss Hermonte, interfered with their work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it because of the Golem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it should be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Hearing this answer, Captain Ferron frowned and touched his chin. There is no beard on his chin, it is a testimony of pure blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he reopened: "Like this kind of thing, it will never happen in the offshore fleet."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" The captain of the sea corps was puzzled. He did not know how this reply relates to his report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complain can't change any problem. If you can't change the environment, you can only adapt yourself to it - I didn't expect that I still don't understand this in the Far Sea Fleet. People." Fei Long's tone is still so flat, but with a sense of oppression that can't be said. If you want to describe it, it is like a solid crater: under the calm appearance, there is another very different thing hidden. "I think if you mention this thing again, you can persuade those who are dissatisfied. Just say what I mean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I understand... I must do it." The captain of the sea squad felt a chill, a heel, and a standard military ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer is still satisfactory. In this way, he does not have to risk the other party's resentment, to persuade the lady; just use the captain's command to press the following, everything will be resolved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, even if the answer does not satisfy him, he does not dare to make any rebuttal. He is not a weak person, but he is by no means a madman who will use all his own bets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What else do you have?" Hearing the captain of the sea corps, the iron wall admiral sighed and politely added a guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, there may be a storm tonight." Hearing this sentence, the half-elf remembered his own judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? It’s a clear sky today. Will it be great? Maybe I don’t know the sea, but I have not encountered this situation in the offshore. It’s sunny in the evening, will there be a storm at night?” The fact that the captain spoke in a plain tone made the half-elf feel a little uncomfortable. It sounds like he is doubting his judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's hard to say, but I don't think it will be small. There is no place to evade nearby." Leonard decided to ignore the feeling of unhappiness and continue Your own statement. "My personal opinion is to put away all the sails, put down the anchor and lower the center of gravity to prevent overturning, drifting with the wind. If possible, ask the Master to reinforce the main mast to prevent breakage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "A very safe judgment, will it be conservative?" Captain Ferron sighed. "If you drift completely with the wind, there may be a large shift in the route. We must always be prepared at the highest speed. Advance, otherwise... If the secret is revealed, it will be over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, just follow your judgment. Before the storm arrives, get ready." Fei Long waved his hand and motioned him to order. The half-elf bowed and sighed and retired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can this be done?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leisha; Helmont wiped the forehead Khan on, asked. Transforming wood into metal magic "metalize", which consumes a lot of spirit, she now feels a little dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, that's fine." Leonard knocked on the mast and it turned out to be completely iron. “How long can this magic last?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A day or so. Is it enough?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think enough, the storm will come tonight. Are your alchemy instruments and golems closed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"nonsense. Not only fixed. Even the walls and the floor have softened, even if it falls, it will not break, and the door is completely sealed." Reza patted her towering chest. "I am a pure gold alchemist." How could this storm make me suffer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, if the door is sealed, how do you get in?" The half-elf keenly thought of one. flaw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course I don't go in, I am helping on the deck. I have to take 1,500 gold coins, and I should do something right."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can this be!" Leonard; Kakawi was shocked. "When the storm, the boat will shake very hard, the deck may even stand up! This is not a place where a lady should be!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You look down Me." Retha glanced at him coldly. "Don't think that a man can do something that a woman can't do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf snorted. At this time, the first drop of rain fell on the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, go to the steering wheel cabin with me and watch the safety ropes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; A strong wind blew, bringing a high wave and interrupting his words. The two hurried back and ran into the rudder wheel bay, and a big wave hit the top of the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are soaked all over. Would you like me to dry it for you?" Inside the steering wheel cabin is the chief officer responsible for the helm and the trainee Pastor Nopp. Nopp greeted them friendly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you still have to keep doing something else, train the pastor." The female alchemist tied the safety rope around his waist, not forgetting Quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was very beautiful when she was sarcasm, the captain of the sea squad thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another big wave hit, the hull jerked to the left, and the deck was filled with the exclamation of the seamen and the sailors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you start to panic when you are so windy!" Leonard was a little angry, stood up and prepared to go out and reprimand the subordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just slammed the door as soon as he walked out. He understood the reasons why everyone exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God! This is a big trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow, black, green clouds It forms a huge spiral that rotates at high speed; red, blue, and purple lightning jumps cheerfully between the clouds. The colorful light penetrates the barrier of the rain, shining the sky in that direction as white. Curiously, all the lightning stopped suddenly on a line—as if there were areas that God had given them, they couldn't take a step. The edge of the lightning looks so magnificent, traversing the entire sea and sky wiring, as if it is an endless wall; if the wall has its end, I am afraid it is dozens of kilometers away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Under anchor! Anchor! Never enter the lightning!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurry to communicate The order, the captain of the sea squad stared at the storm with uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
