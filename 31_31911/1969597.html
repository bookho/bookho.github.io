			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reesa; Hermonte took a strange letter and took a letter from the blue-haired Bartholomew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper quality of the envelope is generally a shilling that can buy a dozen of road goods, with the slanting italic written on the recipient "Liesha" Ms. Hermonte and the "Kezmi; Stewart". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about his people?" asked Reza. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He left because he can't stand it anymore," Barthes answered. "He resisted one-half of the pursuers for us, I think We can't demand him any more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The pirates can't change their nature." Resa smiled slyly and tore open the envelope. The quality of the stationery inside is quite good. It is the first-class imitation velvet bleaching short plaque; the above font is strong and powerful, and it is about the handwriting of a certain instrument. It can be seen that the writer pays attention to this letter. The font of the letter is very large, and a few short sentences are filled with a short page; the words must be modified by the instrument, but the words of the pirate lack of literary genre can still be seen from the lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Reza; Ms. Hermonte: When you saw this letter, I have left the city forever. Maybe I I betrayed you in a certain operation, or maybe I got a chance to leave because of some transactions... In short, I have returned to the sea, or I have already died in a corner of the world. The pirate’s career is like this. Carefree, but you can die at any time - but this is the only way for me, I am not suitable for a stable, calm life. In addition, I think you have already guessed, in fact, I am only temporarily living in you, With your help as a safe haven for me to hunt down. As for what is 'moving the evil and correcting it', it is just an illusion. I am here to apologize to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Here, Leisha frowned and turned over the first page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the original case, if I didn't want to surrender, I would definitely be killed by you on the spot: your ability to be alone with Leonard It is far more than me, not to mention the two together. But if surrendered to the Elf Fleet, I will only face the only ending that is hanged. The rest of the choices will only surrender to you; although some gambling Meaning, but I still gamble to win.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this does not mean that all my feelings are played. It may be unbelievable, but I am true I am impressed by your magical ability and talent, as well as Mr. Kakawi’s chest and temperament. I am a pirate who often betrays others and is often betrayed by others, but I can feel others. The amount of energy. Even people like me can be tolerant, and have no reservations, from the heart of trust, Leonard; Mr. Kakawi's volume is indeed like the endless sea. It is a tolerant whole The mind of the ocean, if it is not my interference, This is a soar of the Dragon "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; After the alchemist a write-mouth, the second page of this disdain, turn to the last page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for you, Ms. Hermont, I also express the same respect: You are indeed the most powerful woman I have ever seen. But... I have to remind You, you are destroying Leonard; Kikawi is a respectable man. When Hailong is trapped in a pond, he will gradually die. Perhaps you have chosen to be with him for emotional reasons. But this is actually destroying his existence. I want to see Leonard; Lord Kakawi, a man who is on the vast ocean, not a captain who is fishing in a pond. Please don’t because of certain The emotional factor makes a really great captain land on the land..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza’s hand is shaking, the expression on her face becomes very complicated, it seems I have received a lot of shock. She had no intention of looking at the rest of the content, but silently closed the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out... even this person, so look at me. Is my approach wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barbie Silk; she could not answer without answering her question. Although Bonnie; Saffir can answer, she does not want to answer. She has another thing to do: use another letter left by Katzmi to fight the volume and chest of a half-elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, Reza fell asleep in the room and forgot to add magic to her new work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton lowered the cap and ran against the sun next to the body. Dico; Lemda's head has been separated from the body, and there is no need to confirm whether there is any breath. The sudden blue light made him end his life without pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when I really stood in front of the body of this person... the teenager felt a bit lonely. He shook his head and respected the body for a less standard military service. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A general of the Free Army, if there is no military service at the funeral, it is too far behind. Although I am not your real subordinate... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the ceremony was finished, Soleton turned and walked towards the group of defeated soldiers behind him. He was surprised to find that all the soldiers looked at him as a hypothetical ensign with awe; many of them followed his movements and also bowed to the body of Lymda. This should have been a solemn scene, but from the eyes of Solton, it seems extraordinarily ironic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, who is qualified to say that this bloody tragedy tonight is not an ironic scene? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager sighed and turned to the approaching Lopez Army. Probably because of the contempt for these remnants, Clade only left the ninth consecutive company to be surrendered; but seeing these remnants salute their highest sergeant, the company commander he did not know was very cautious and wise to stop. The footsteps. He stopped outside the 80-meter effective range of the arquebus and shouted: "Do you want to surrender, or do you want to use your life to make a hopeless commemoration? You are the sergeant, decide it quickly!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Craded gun" made a creaking sound, and it came forward from the back, blocking the front of the infantry. The arrival of this oppressive weapon caused a small commotion among the defeated soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton can feel that everyone’s eyes are concentrated on him. By this time, the boy realized that he was the highest rank among the rest. He touched the epaulettes on his shoulders, revealing a smile that made everyone around him feel at ease, and slowly walked out of the array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment he took the array, the surrounding commotion suddenly calmed down, and it was so quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly has a feeling: even if he now orders "all the troops charge!", there will be many soldiers who rushed toward the death chariot without hesitation. . Perhaps this is the pleasure of mastering his power to kill the power? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton smiled a bit and expelled unrealistic fantasies from his mind. He put his left hand, who had already lost his feelings, into his arms, pulled out the white cloth that had already been prepared, and lifted it up. The white cloth danced slightly in the soft wind under the sun, and it was a bit bleak with a few patches of clear snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We surrender. There is no need to pay more sacrifices. After all, we are all soldiers of the Free Army. But I have a request - I hope you will be kind The body of our general."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard a few sighs from behind, and then the sound of the soldiers throwing their weapons underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing his request, the opposite eyebrows shook a little, but still nodded: "Although it does not represent General Lopez, I personally promise you Request, Dico; the body of Major General Lemda will be converged in perfect condition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." The teenager whispered and walked towards the prisoner behind. group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, can I ask your name, less?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youth I sighed a bit: "...the door is low."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a soldier with a true sense of honor. If there is a chance, I will definitely go to the top. Asking to take you from a light sentence." The company commander said very seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that he might be pursued as a soldier, the teenager sneaked into a larger group of prisoners. I don't know why, the company commander did not ask him to pay the gun at his waist - of course, even if he paid it out, he could find Uncle Clade to come back later, Soledon thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the second twilight came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fading of the sun is as sudden as it is, without any warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, the sky first flashed twice - the entire sky flashed twice. The noon sun shines, and the same night's night meets, mixing the faint yellow tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People looked up and looked at the twilight that came again. Just before the midnight bell struck, the sun that had been shining all the way began to weaken and weaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riss raised his right hand and looked at the right hand that had done countless great magic. Looking at the strange palm print, she felt like she was in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow flakes that had been melted by the heat of the sun as rain began to fly again. In the midnight twilight, the soldiers of the two armies braved the wind and snow and prepared for the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My ten years of hard work... just delayed the arrival of the fate of the twilight? What did I do?" Reese put down her hand. Flick the hair of the forehead and let the dense blond hair cover your eyes. Through this golden curtain, she felt that everything in front of her eyes seemed to be a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tactics is the central storm, starting at 12 o'clock on the 8th. The central 16th company, making a batch break along the five avenues, the left and right wing defensive formation Contraction. What Klad can rely on is only his artillery; according to the reconnaissance unit, the enemy artillery is distributed in the northwest and southeast borders of the North Third District to maximize its effectiveness. The central government forcibly broke through and made his flank artillery lose its effectiveness.” Radz; Govar’s fingers crossed the map and drawn a central breakthrough attack route. “Don’t fight with each other’s self-propelled guns. Then disrupt the establishment into the melee, relying on the folk house to advance! Remember, our army has an absolute advantage in the strength!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light is dimming, the night is coming. The huge dimensional lens is gradually thinning and disappears without a trace. Magic, lifted at 12 o'clock midnight. Reese sighed and turned around, buried her face in the pillow and went to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on." Klad; Lopez stood up against the night, looking at the north, listening to the other side's actions, "Sure enough, the central breakthrough... ...then let me end your dreams, Govars."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around at the troops: 900 people plus a Clade gun . The flanked forces did have more artillery - but those were prepared to surround the entire Tenth Division from the reverse. The infantry formation behind each cannon is only one-fifth of the standard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you rush to the bottom of the valley, it is when the pockets are closed. Will you first wear the bottom of the pocket, or will I close the encirclement first?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red arrow and the blue line of defense begin to meet on the map, and the first line of defense has been broken. Lenny began to burn, burning away blood, life, freedom, dreams, patriotism and many other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there is nothing more to use as fuel, the fire is extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first morning light was on the spire of the parliament building, and the clock sounded exactly seven times. The snow has already stopped, leaving only a thin layer of road ice, which has been turned into a black spot. On the street where peace has been restored, it is already possible to hear the news stories of the newsboys and the hoofs of the patrols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hermont House on the south edge of the 3rd district of Lenni is not indulged in this early morning noisy, the guests in the mansion have already started busy early. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The riddled wall must be repaired, and the "wall" that strangely extends into the air must also be rebuilt. The accumulated goods are re-shipped to the branches, and the losses suffered last night are also investigated - after all, the night battles continue until the twilight subsides. Of course, in addition to these abnormal transactions, normal transactions still have to be done. The breakfast had to be done, and the maids who pushed the bowls began to come in and out of several restaurants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rhythm of familiar female voices came from afar. When the maids saw the familiar figure, they hurried back to the side and acted in accordance with the rules to the general responsible person of the mansion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Bonnie, Good Morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Bonnie, Good Morning." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman is getting closer, and when she hears these greetings, she can’t help but laugh. She fiddled with her golden hair and smiled and replied: "What? I don't recognize me once in a while?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several maids listen To this voice, I was taken aback and hurriedly changed my mind: "Hold, sorry, Miss Anne! We didn't expect you to get up so early..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Riss...?" Several maids subconsciously repeated the name in some confused tone. I don't know why Miss Anne suddenly changed her name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riss rushed to them and continued to walk to the restaurant: no matter where she was, she could find out where her sister was. Her pace is steady and powerful, and it is completely different from the brisk pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Anne...sit seems to be a little different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now Miss Reese Be careful, be careful of her next time. Do you think that she seems to have changed personally?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be calmer than before...or , reality?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reese pretends not to hear the whispers behind it, gently pushing the door of the restaurant with the classical relief. Bonnie, who has recovered the short brown hair, is sitting on a black wooden chair and enjoying a regular breakfast consisting of omelettes, milk and bread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning. Did you sleep well last night, sister?" Seeing Reese coming in, Bonnie asked the tableware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I supported the magic for two hours, and I was tired to sleep until now...I’m afraid it can’t be called very good.” Reese hit a Yawn, pull out another chair next to you and sit down. Occasionally getting up early does feel very sleepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was only a nine-segment magic... Bonnie sighed, and she already felt the shake of her sister's spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to apologize to you, my sister. The plan is too imperfect to produce so many variables."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to apologize. If it weren't for your efforts, I wouldn't wake up from a dream. It's not easy for you to decide that you always want to control everything. You are not easy. So I am sure that I can work with you to bring the history back to the original track, Miley?" Reese whispered as if nothing had happened - but her eyes were sober and sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie smiled a bit, biting her lip and seemingly fighting to say it; but she finally spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s still not you. Yes, this plan is to change history and let your sister realize the reality. By the strength of both of us, it’s absolutely It’s impossible to stop the change of history, my sister.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riss took the milk and said after a sip of it: “Think carefully, the one who gets rid of it in advance The plan of biological power is too radical, unlike your handwriting. If a plan has such obvious weaknesses, then it must have other intentions. I can think of the only possibility - myself. You hope Let me realize that history has not been reversed, I hope that I will give up the illusory love plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown-haired girl sighed: "Sister, you are at a critical moment. Observing power and analytical power are still so good. To be honest, this plan is somewhat dangerous; but according to my calculations, you and I should be able to become a balancing force that suppresses undead, so that history should not deviate too much. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To each other. Your plan is still so strict, the real goal is completely achieved." Reese laughed and tried to create a relaxed atmosphere, but the laughter still appeared Some holes. "How was the last battle last night? What happened after the undead was expelled?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Read the newspaper yourself." Bonnie replied . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reese picked up a few major newspapers from the silver plate next to her and took a brief look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Freedom Daily editorial: Freedom is invincible, and attempts to dictate coups will fail!" "The Matter Times Times Special Issue: Thrilling The night of the coup, the mysterious midnight sun, the national hero Clade; the exclusive interview with General Lopez." "The Lenny Post: Outside the new Congress, the undead will be expelled from the Holy Congress, the pastor The new members will be tested for anti-death." "The Protestant Rational Proverbs" headline: The salvation of God's grace is our firm faith calling for the grace of God; the Freedom Masters Association said that it will be the sun last night. Source for retrospective analysis..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, Lopez won, every newspaper looks almost the same..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She was dating Leonard in the yard because she saw a letter last night..." Bonnie smiled. "A letter of resignation with a sharp word. If I didn't estimate it wrong, we were full." The independent spirit of the hostess will soon let someone return to the sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way...that is, everything is finally back to history "On the right track, right?" Reese put down the newspaper. "If even Leonard; Kikawi is back to the sea, chances are that I still have hope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Hearing her words, Bonnie’s face was very strange, and she couldn’t tell whether she was crying or laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the track? I think you may have some misunderstandings, my sister... I suggest you flip through the other pages of these newspapers and look for the small headings in those corners. To ensure Above all stability, they didn't put the news on the front page."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't the empire attacked? This news, we can already get from I know it in the history books of later generations.” Reese opened the middle page of the newspaper and looked for what Bonnie had mentioned in various social news and article advertisements. “Oh, there. Erbao News: The Northern Forces of the Empire are extremely stupid, and there seems to be a possibility of attacking south! My border forces have been waiting for them, and will inevitably hit the enemy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not this, look for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Senator of the Sao Sen said last night that the government of Sansen still firmly supports the Republic, regardless of the situation of the coup. The only legitimate government that opposes all the provinces and affiliates of the divided provinces The country’s attempt...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Not this, continue.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an interview with the reporter, Major General Tedwood, the deputy general of General Lopez, said that he would continue to pursue the rebel army in the lower town of Fort Myers in the lower reaches of the Maitbeisi River and the rebel army in the northern military region. Let him accept the trial of justice..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, that's it. Do you feel that this official article is a bit strange to read? The part of the table is determined. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be sure to capture the rebel leader...you mean?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riss The hand shook, and the remaining half of the cup of milk in his hand spilled over the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I admit that this incident is beyond my calculations. We may be too young to see the storm of history..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, a red bell on the table screamed harshly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now don't ask the servant to wipe, do you let me calm down first?" Reese covered her ears with both hands, and some dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, that's not what I pressed, it's a guest bell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a Clade; Mr. Lopez visited, is it a reception? The voice of the guard came from the sound tube. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sisters looked at each other and bitterly caught their hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 7, 1665, Laditz, Chairman of the Freedom Army Staff Meeting, served for one year; Marshal Govar joined forces with the defending forces and 10th Division of the Rennie The 'Lenny' force launched a typical self-community coup. However, this coup was suppressed by Clade and Marshal Lopez in one day. Even the politicians who planned the coup were not able to figure out, but it is suspected that it may be 3 years. After being uncovered, the undead political parties were related. On the evening of the same day, Radz; Marshal Govar committed suicide...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Then there was a “small” change in history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 7, 1665, Laditz, Chairman of the Freedom Army Staff Meeting, served for one year; Marshal Govar joined forces with the defending forces and 10th Division of the Rennie The 'Lenny' force launched a typical self-community coup. Because of Clade's active Marshal Lopez, the Govar army failed to control the capital, and had to lead the main force from the port area to break through, hold the ship of the inner water fleet down the river, and reorganize the team in Fort. Due to the influence of Radz; Gowar in the Northern Army, the troops of the Northern Military Region expressed their support for the hawkish veteran and did not recognize the authority of the Provisional Parliament and the government...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
