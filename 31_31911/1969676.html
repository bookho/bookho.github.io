Free Army General Staff<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***-***-***-***-***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Receiving the Empire The surrender troops spent a whole night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of being surrendered, an elite group of the Governor’s brigade suddenly made a mistake and broke the order to force a breakout. This unexpected night battle made everyone exhausted, causing no small losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extra hundreds of wounded and prisoners of war made the officers and soldiers of the Freedom Army squandered. Lopez took more patrols from his own troops and warned of possible counterattacks. He estimated that one or two thousand imperial soldiers disappeared into the hills near Jena with chaos. If you add the sentinel magical force that was defeated before, there are probably about 3,000 emperors scattered around Jena, which is not a big threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We accepted the last four companies, the surrender of 510 enemies, the sir." A dwarf eunuch of a Klad gunfighter reported, " In addition, we could not find the whereabouts of Sid Nass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unsurprisingly, let him go. It is difficult to catch a senior mage. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admiral Krad Lopez issued the last order, extinguishing the torch in his hand: "Use the reserve team to maintain pressure on the surrounding area. There will be no fighting today, let your work go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officers of the Western Generals rushed to their original position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals looked at the Chaoyang and walked into the temporary tent group of the staff who had just set up. The old staff and half of the barracks were blown up in yesterday's artillery battle, and the engineering team built a new one overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The early class officers have not yet got up, the night shift officers are still outside commanding and hosting prisoners of war, and now the Liberal Army General Staff is the only one. Clade walked through a few curtain doors, sat down behind his desk and began issuing orders. After completing his work, he did not call the commander, but he walked out with a large stack of documents and threw it on the desks of the staff officers. The general will look at the watch, not yet breakfast time. He stretched a pleasant waist and walked back to his tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still owe me an explanation, Clade."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Marshal with gray hair Conti Fox is sitting in his position, waiting for him. On the table is a bottle of red wine that has just been opened, giving off the unique fragrance of the new wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait to drink this bottle and drink me, you must have never drunk this distilled wine." Clade put his hand into his arms, magical I found a beautiful porcelain bottle, "The authentic Western Tang Dynasty kiln celadon bottle, the seventeen-year wax seal official residence of the Daqu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although I I don’t understand, but I feel that it is a very cultural wine. If there is no such thing, can the Jena region also produce such a bar?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carat De picked up the glass and sipped himself: "The vines have all been burned. But as long as the roots are still there, we can graft them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" We were almost burned." Fox smiled. "Do you think so, will you leave the reserve team in Jena, Admiral Lopez? I have not received any notice from the Western General."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word front is like a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lomez looks as usual, standing and explaining: "This thing has to start from an unreliable self-propelled gun. You know the breakdown rate of this thing." Up to every 100 kilometers? There are 70% of the self-propelled guns, it is impossible to reach the northern line, so I left them directly nearby. In order to protect these weapons, I left a third of the troops, I did not expect It just happened to come in handy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately the emperor does not know this, right?" The marshal continued to smile, and the tone suddenly turned, "I There is only one question. From the beginning, have you left one-third of the elite units directly left?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No notification, no signal , no documents, no transfer soldiers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No notification, no signal, no documents, no transmissions."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if we are almost going to collapse, your troops are here too?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cradd slowly nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing wrong with holding the reserve team, but you don't realize that this is a very dangerous plan?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kingle's fox slaps the glass in his hand and stares at the slightly sagged arc and continues to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lopez drank the wine in his hand: "I believe that you can hold the camp. If you look at the wrong time, it is my ability; if I can't turn the timing into a winning one, that's not enough for my calculations. Fortunately, it didn't happen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is your way to do it. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my way of doing it. I have never doubted my decision, no matter what, no matter what the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excessive self-confidence is arrogance, Admiral."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The staff of the Western Army I also believe that you and your officers can hold on. In fact, if it is not Silver Dragon, this 仗 did not need us to act. We not only saw the opportunity. We chose the opportunity."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have chosen the opportunity." Conti Fox whispered, staring at Clade's eyes: "I have heard of you since more than a decade ago. Whether it is at the military academy or in At the border, people are saying, 'If things go on, Clade Lopez will one day become a Marshal of the Freedom.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the middle-aged general In the middle, it is full of firmness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you left the army, many people celebrated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fox stood up and raised The wine glass is tilted. The red translucent liquid quietly flows out of the glass and lands on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I heard your explanation, Lopez."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krad The shoulders shivered slightly and did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think that the day you paid for your actions has arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conti, the Marshal Fox, took off his military cap and placed it on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From now on, the entire Free Army field force will be handed over to you. I will follow the advice of the staff and flee back to safe Lenny." The old marshal looks like a sigh of relief. "It’s not my responsibility to go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cradd slowly picked up the cap Just like this military cap has an iron weight: "This is really a heavy price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To win, Marshal Lopez." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow your order, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conti? Fox takes it from the table From the celadon bottle: "As a price, I took this bottle of wine. What is the name? My grandson will like this wine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please wait for the news at Lenny." The new marshal who completed the biggest encirclement in history answered this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the old Marshal’s departure, Clade Lopez regained his position and covered his face with the marshal’s cap and closed. eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything in memory is repeated in uncontrollable eyes. He has gone through so many battlefields, from the West to the East, from the East to the West. The motherland and dreams, perseverance and courage, the future and hope, all that is, everything, and everything, will eventually stay on this rank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Free Marshal Clade Lopez". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally sat in this position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in this position directly directing the 180,000 regular and irregular forces of the republics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit in this position that has been used by numerous names to prove himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will save his country in this position, or destroy it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sound of the cloth, an officer walked into the tent and freed the new marshal from his memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello? I have some questions about the order you just issued."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krad Put down the military cap and correct the sitting position: "Resistance? Captain Soledon. Already in the morning shift, is there anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is hesitant to handle The order book is heavily placed on the table: "General General, I personally have doubts about this order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be so embarrassed, we The hero. Stand straight and stand up." Clad picked up the order. "Is there any problem with this order? The unit you pulled up will be permanently compiled and will still be directed by you. Official number It is the first 'Republic' division's second independent battalion 'Fortune'. It will continue to exist like the first independent battalion 'Guangfu' until the end of the Freedom Army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is coughing twice. His tone is full of confusion and confusion: "You...you know that I am not talking about the first page."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cradd opened That page. "Is it decided to deal with the captives? I don't think there is any problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first page is written in the bold red text: "Olivia? Hugh Coleman, the first princess of the empire, prisoners of war, first-level guards, imprisoned for exchange." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the door is gradually getting better: "No. You know who I am talking about. I saw your signature, I can't understand." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krad turned the second page and turned the order and placed it in front of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still feel that there is no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second page, writes this A line of words--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" 黛 ? 薇 薇 薇 冯 冯 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费 费. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is retorted by the door: "I can't accept this order. I need an explanation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The princess with the actual military position can be regarded as a brigadier. We have not been able to seize Sid Nasse, so the imperial prisoners of war are headed by her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You know what kind of explanation I want." The doorman lowered his voice. "Even if it is a secret... but she is your daughter, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kela German gas stagnation: "I don't have a daughter. Don't mention this again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know, she is Jenny. Card! She is Seneca Lopez! She is your biological daughter, sir! You don't have a daughter, do you remember your wife?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The door was violently shut up. Unconsciously, he found himself roaring at the top commander, and his hands were on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged marshal is looking into his eyes and smiles warmly. His eyes seem to penetrate the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, sir." Resist the door and step back two steps. "I am dying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krad's finger slid gently over the name: "Do you know how many free officers and soldiers have been killed by this Marquis of Finica? Fingota?, Captain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, sir. But she is still your daughter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Junia? Weilun? von Figota is not an ordinary prisoner of war. She is a magician, a citizen of the Republic. The citizen of the Republic assists the enemy in treason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But treason does not necessarily require a death penalty. She is not a soldier, she is never, she cannot apply military law." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krad’s eyes are not shaken. He just sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you suggesting that I make a special order to forgive a traitor who is stained with blood of our comrades, Captain?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the door is a bit moist. He secretly rubbed his eyes with his hand. "This is not a forgiveness, just another chance. She should have the opportunity to choose her own life. She has not even begun to choose!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Life is something that cannot be chosen ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klad stood up and took a few steps in the tent. Hard silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Like she can't choose a parent, I can't choose a daughter. Once you make the wrong choice, you have to take responsibility for it. If I Forgive him, who can forgive me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clade sat back on his chair and turned his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I went to the celebration party last night." Clade’s topic turned and seemed to start to say something that had nothing to do with, "In that celebration. On, your magical good fortune and the general vitality are the things that everyone talks the most."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marshal took the marshal hat and put it on his face. For the first time, Nanimen noticed that his military cap was different and widened his eyes in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I was there to hear more than one person mentioned, 'If things go on like this, Naimen? Soledon will one day become the Marshal of the Freedom.' Go to the execution of the order, Captain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door quietly respected a military ceremony, picked up the order and turned back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he picked up the curtain, he heard Clarke’s low pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't guess the ending. I used to think, you will be my son-in-law...now I still think so."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful voice that was full of magnetism in the past sounded a bit hoarse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain Soledon returned with the file Own camp. Several military camps in the vicinity were plowed by the Fegota artillery, causing various losses from the photos of the family to the spoiled spoils. His camp had the privilege of escaping, but there was nothing in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resist the door to open his own bag, rummaging through the paper and pen. He remembered that there was some fireproof paper left after the last time the scroll was finished, and the enchanted ink should also have a new can. He also found his official ring. This 玺 ring was issued when it was promoted to the captain. Since it was too formal, he had not used it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was cut from the rolled parchment and cut into two pieces at the seal: "If I, Naomi? Soledon had an accident, Please forward this document to Lieutenant Anne Sefer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up another one and did it according to this, and pressed it with a ring. Printed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the letter is also very simple: "Annie, please take care of my strong operations. Those people are me on the battlefield. You are the most trustworthy I know." Officer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After writing, the door was sealed with wax, put a roll on the table, and another roll in the jacket pocket. He took off the medals and collars, put the cloaks in the trunks of every officer, and took out the epaulettes of his ensign's era from the mezzanine of the box and put them in the jacket pocket. He returned to the table, picked up the order, opened the second page, looked at it, and closed it. Just like going to war, he put on his military uniform, carried the armed belt, hung the gun, and stuffed the new medicine tube into the inner bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went out and left the military camp of the Jena. The road passed through the camp of Meti Crosso, where a large number of leisurely soldiers without shifts were crowded. Resist the door to stop and inquire about it, and learned that the beautiful girl player has not yet got up, and the fare for the afternoon performance has increased to three bottles of red wine or a bottle of distilled spirits. He shrugged, didn't go in, turned and walked to the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camp for the most dangerous prisoners of war is located in a medium-sized building on the banks of the Kings. There is no prison in Jena. The building was originally a town hall. It was temporarily used as a prisoner of war camp after the installation of a full-service detection system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Captain Soledon, you have worked hard. Is it to interrogate the prisoners of war?" A sergeant at the door honoured the military ceremony and warmly greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the entire Jena army, there is not much to know the door of Captain Soledon. It is eagerly rumored that the brave young man accepted the command of the marshal and turned the story of arrogance in Jena. At the celebration party last night, the officers from the various departments of the Western Army were in a constant stream. They held the glasses and sipped them with great pride. Although there are not many female officers, their alcohol consumption is even more alarming, and the wine is more difficult to refuse. Until now, Naimen seems to feel that hangover is affecting his ability to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Resist the door and nodded and presented the document. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sergeant swept his eyes and gave him the whole bunch of keys: "Going to the women’s prison? The most dangerous ones are there. Right cloister The deepest part."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door quickly walked past a room in the original City Hall. District councillors have their own offices here, and these tightly guarded offices can be converted into prisons. The post was set up a few times, the trap changed direction, and the alert circle was layered one after another. In theory, each advanced caster should be held incommunicado and wearing handcuffs and ankles that constrain the effects of the spell; but this time the captain's senior officers and casters are too many, and there are not so many rooms to be held in solitary confinement. The Jena army captured all three brigade-level units in one go, plus the Rasta detachment that had been defeated before, and the total number of captive mages and pastors exceeded 100. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, Captain Soledon. Interrogation work?" In the depths, there is of course a sentry. This time the guard was a famous magic officer, a lieutenant who was known by Namen, and the Western General. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Notify the work. There are a few people who want to review it." The doorman slammed the command book in his hand. "I hate to have some work. You are here." How did it get done, crowded like the dormitory of the Lonnie University witches? The dirty mess is not mentioned, a room can actually squeeze into four or five young girls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't mention it. Fortunately, you didn't really catch Sid? Naser or Silver Dragon yesterday. If you catch it, we will die without a place to die." The lieutenant took over the command book. With two eyes, I complained while signing. "The female prisoner's camp is better. The male prisoner camp has rioted last night. The second division used a cannon to smash half of the church before it was suppressed. They never dare. Let these men get together and let the female prisoners take their place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door itself took the key from the wall: "You will not let the woman The Marquis is also crowded into a small office with others?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We let her and the princess princess Staying in one. This is the best treatment." The officer in charge of the guard smiled. "It's pretty, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you follow The regulations stipulated that they should be able to take anti-magic means, and they should not be fragrant." Nanimen laughed and opened the lock of the heavy wooden door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I personally feel that the full set of anti-magic means is quite flamboyant -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door was closed and the door was closed directly. The innermost part of the office, which was originally the speaker's office, was designed specifically for secret conversations and has excellent sound insulation. He stepped on the anti-magic array from the secretary's desk and opened the door of the inner room with a key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one that Yanika wore was the lavender general dress, and the dirt and blood on the top were not removed. She used a somewhat quirky posture to squash her in the deepest armchair in the office, revealing a cold smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the nobles of Olia should feed me! The first princess of the imperial court, I would like to feed others like a maid! You are also free. The army’s captain, don’t you think it’s a shame? If you relax, I won’t run away-”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oria sitting on the table next to it Not so excited, she slammed her hand on the door. It seemed to be justified: "Okay, I don't know what to feed. After all, we are prisoners of war."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door looked at Renee, who had at least four anti-magic tricks on her body. This childhood girl, now looks like an elegant panther in a trap, his hands are backed up behind the back, leaning against the armrests of the chair. There are two pairs of anti-cutting on the back of the arm. One metal is used to hold the wrist, and the leather chain is attached to the upper arm. There are also two pairs on the leg, this time the metal is on the ankle and the cortex is on the calf. Probably because of these flaws, she was placed obliquely on the armchair. In contrast, Princess Olia, who is a pastor, is much more free. Only two skins are bound to the hands and feet, and the hands are not cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He secretly nodded: the guy outside was not bad. Renee is indeed much more dangerous than Olia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay. I know that you must have something to do, what is written on the stack of things in your hand? What information is needed?" The tone is full of impatience, "Say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is silent. He began to circle around the room and thought about how to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh...this is not an intelligence requirement. My sir - you know who I am talking about - I want to know..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped and took a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you really want to go back, 黛妮卡?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the armchair The brown-haired girl curled up into a group of lips, and her face was red and white, and I didn’t know how to answer it. Her body twisted twice in the chair, as if she wanted to reach out, but she was not allowed to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably it would be wrong, and the door is a bit excited: "That... if you are willing to accept, I can take you to the sir. He should be Give you a chance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time even Olia can't stand it anymore. The first princess of the empire coughed up fiercely, just like it was: "Lieutenant! Although there are some abruptness, I still have to say that it is impossible for you like this! Faced with a so-called request from a trapped lady, this Not a request, but a threat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is that the case?" The door took the key from the waist, "That..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 twitched again in the chair: "Enough, Olia, don't talk to this idiot. I can't move, you can beat him for me." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door turned subconsciously. He saw Olia staggering up from the chair, bowed his head and stammered and asked: "Really, really want to fight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Of course, hit. Hands-on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door suddenly felt a pain in the back of the head, and a cold feeling soaked him. His legs were soft and he struggled two steps forward and fell on the shoulders of Olia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long green hair, Maggie ya wearing a military uniform, standing behind him, her right hand index finger flashing ice blue The light. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The princess took the key in the door of the door and carefully placed his body on the chair, and finally relieved: "We finally fooled." It’s really uncomfortable.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Your play is not white, he really thinks we have only two people here.” Actually, Maggie smirked "He didn't notice the attack from behind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Olia untied her body, she came up to help her unravel. Yanika stretched out and suddenly screamed: "Ah... shoulder card, stuck, painful..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The princess didn’t know for a while What to do, or Maggie ya came up to help her to correct the position of the shoulder. Three women gathered around the door of the fainted door and began the next step. Yanika took off the uniform of the door, and Maggie picked up the thick stack of orders and quickly flipped through it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading a few lines, Maggie's movements slowed down. She took a deep breath and whispered, "Do you know that this young man is determined to hold a mortal death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." Renee gnawed her lip and replied. She is holding a roll of parchment letterhead that is resistant to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you know that he was going to let us go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know This letter is for me to see." Yanika smiled. "This guy took off all the medals and collars, leaving only the epaulettes and the letter. Moreover, there are two sets of epaulettes, a set of ensigns, one Put on the pipa."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Princess Olia’s eyes widened: "This is specially prepared for us, 黛妮卡."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastards are good people..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't rush to conclusions." Maggie has already read the stack Command book, stuffed a thick stack of paper in the hands of Renee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡Looking down. The establishment of strong operations, the decision on the disposal of prisoners of war, the status of replenishment of the Free Army, the statistics of losses, the admission of prisoners, and...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .

"He should also cooperate with us."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Renee squatted down and took a hidden knife from the door-to-door military boots. "There is one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp She looked at the face of the door. Without a suitable place for the knife, she cut a strand of hair around the back of the chair and handed it to Maggie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you will become magic, and the material will be enough."

You remember it very clearly." Maggie stared at them both. "Hey," he laughed, shook his head and put on the military uniform of the door, and took care of his hair. "What's next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will soon Will be discovered, we give up this identity, and then engage in a military uniform." Renee replied, "There is ample information in the documents he brings. We have an advantage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"At 11 o'clock in the morning, Marshal Fox is going to Lenny. Organizes the guard to protect the portal to Lenny."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a glance, nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
