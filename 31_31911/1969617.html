Let the capital's lords see what we are!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can compare this level with the masters of the whole army!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deafening The cheers and cheers surround you. The red-red light rises from the infantry training ground, ensuring that the power of the flame will not leak out of it. Forty men and women dressed in neat winter uniforms and faint red fire-proof halo around them gathered in the fire enchantment and geared up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If there is anything uncoordinated, only the two hundred and more flaming birds running in the enchantment are round flamingos. No matter how the killing or bloody game, encountering these cute little things will become powerless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I seem to start to understand why the Free Army has this cruel and expensive tradition..." Namim talked to himself and observed the field. Case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully leaned back against the fire enchantment, staring at the firebirds on the left and right sides who walked leisurely. Their cockles are not tied with ropes, and they can spur more than a meter long burning flame at any time. A very dangerous and exciting traditional project that leaves a light gray burn spot on the skin. According to the rules, players are not allowed to use weapons or magic to attack other players. Only the flames emitted by the flamingo are considered effective attacks - of course, attacking the firebird is still allowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they are not the most dangerous, the most dangerous guys are leaning against the fire enchantment like him. Naomi knew a few people from other units: their magic is probably better than him, but the rank is not as high as him, and his position is not good. In any case, they have plenty of reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The game begins!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a certain authority preempted the corner position The lieutenant colonel loudly conveyed the order to the referee on the side of the field; immediately, he immediately pierced a nearby firebird with a short spear in his hand and added the first score to his scoreboard. A group of the second lieutenant had not had time to respond, and was burned by the flame before the flamingo died. The lineman immediately ordered him to leave without mercy—so Eugen got the second point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cheat! Cheating!" The soldiers belonging to the Third Regiment immediately screamed, but they were suppressed by the observers of Eugen’s cronies. However, such an obvious provocative act did arouse the same enemy of the players who were originally fighting in the field. All the firepower was concentrated on the Lieutenant Colonel. Several soldiers who were close to each other immediately grabbed the flamingo from the side and put it in his hand, rushing toward Eugen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lieutenant colonel still chewed the gums slowly and suddenly rolled around the ground, avoiding the first firebird that was thrown over and Flames, followed by a loud and loud command: "The targets are concentrated, Itis, Peter, open fire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound he ordered was so large, positive The soldiers who rushed to him reflexively stopped and looked around – at this moment, Lieutenant Colonel Eugen showed a well-thought-out smile, his right hand sweeping out like the wind, using his best skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"force glue-like force field!""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, the fan-shaped force field from him The right arm stretched out across the range and slid away. As the force field gradually rises from the low to the high, there are countless invisible low walls in the center of the field. Many of the flamingos were arched by this force, but under the deliberate control of Lieutenant Colonel Eugen, no one was directly touched by the force field. At the edge of the field, it seems that there are countless invisible pillars that hang the firebirds in the air. All the players near this half of Eugen, the face changed dramatically! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is already late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, Eugen, we have to grab points!" Peter; Major Cousin opened the military uniform and instantly took out more than a dozen coats from his belt. The knives that ignite the phosphorus are thrown away by one of the flamingos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I am smiling when I give this gift to the gods." The female captain smiled coldly, and the rays of the left and right hands were shot like an online gun. Each hot line hit a firebird's fire sac. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, don't sneak, leave me some points!" Eugen was in a hurry, and he took out a spear and kept stabbing nearby firebirds. His shouts reminded others that many people immediately began to earn the scores of the top firebirds and the trapped people in these power fields, completely disregarding the friendship. The anti-European encirclement network immediately disintegrated and fell into a scuffle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Passing the field, burning a fourth group of sergeants, scored their fourth and fifth points. Now that no one has noticed him at all, he is happy to earn a flamingo score a little bit on the edge of the melee, or to earn a one or two clicks with a shot or a sneak attack. Anyway, it’s a good thing to be humble at this time—not to mention that he has slightly shifted his position with refraction magic. Phantom magic is one of the few magics he is best at. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 points, I haven’t finished the bottom... But these people are really amazing, he thinks a little self-deprecating. The more you think about it, the slower your hands move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game took less than ten minutes, and twenty-seven people left, only 13 people left. The number of flamingos is not counted, but there is not much left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 40-person big scoreboard that was temporarily set up was already messed up by a group of scorers, and the names of Captain Kussen and Captain Ittis were painted behind them. 18" and "21"; what is more surprising is that the sacred shield of the paladin is swaying and swaying through the flamingo group of the flamingo group; the Viscount Rasta There are 15 points, which is higher than 12 points of Lieutenant Colonel Eugen. Further to the bottom of them are the navy lieutenant who is good at throwing many flying knives, and a lieutenant who is good at dispelling fire magic, with 11 points and 9 points respectively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry about rushing to grab points, first defeat the team of the staff, otherwise don't say group points, even the individual points we have no chance! Everyone puts their feet The flamingo drove over, beware of the sniper of the major and the captain, and gathered in the northeast corner!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The navy lieutenant found that the top four were actually the direct troops of the staff People, some panic. He immediately summoned all the nine people left in the vicinity and retired to the corner, and they were confronted with Lieutenant Colonel Eugen in the southwest corner. His orders were clear and well-organized, and the other soldiers who had been in a mess before had actually returned to order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good..." Eugen spit out the mouth of the mouth and habitually stretched his hand to the waist, seemingly looking for something, "destruction." Their collection!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But before he ordered his order, Isis had already shot. Accurate flame rays traverse the invisible force field and fly toward the soldiers who are collecting the firebirds. Three rays hit the ground of Eugen, but the rest rushed into the eastern half without any force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Throw away the firebirds in your hands and immediately fall down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The navy lieutenant was slightly confused But still decisively ordered - this timely order made Itis's ray missing. There was indeed a corporal who was smashed by the flamingo, but there was also a sergeant who was not only burned by the flamingo, but also directly burned by the flames of Isis. Everyone in the staff of the staff has turned green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Corporal Wiscon, exit! Sergeant Kato, exit! Captain Itis, quits!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this judgment, the eyes of the captain showed a hint of regret, with his 25 points left. On the sidelines, Captain Itis's escorts came with a sigh of regret, and then applauded for the highest score. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, it seems that all of us men have to work hard." Eugen touched his chin and shouted "There, we will fight!" The firebird with your monopoly rushes to the middle. Whoever stands last will receive the remaining dozens of firebirds! We are not good for the weak women to take the championship, isn’t it?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, your agreement is fair...just so!" The navy lieutenant responded, his left hand swayed and took the soldiers forward. "All With the Firebird charge! Dispel his power field!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lieutenant raised his hand, Eugen's force field turned into a dust in the air. When the middle school and other three people gathered to meet their assault, the right hand of the navy lieutenant hiding behind him suddenly threw a four-handed flying knife and crossed the entire center of the stadium without force! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eugen hurriedly raised his hand and used a force field to stop the flame of a firebird around him. The foreign aid Rasta was concocted, and another flamingo was opened with an invisible sacred shield with a greenish glow. Seeing these two guys who practice defensive magic escaped with this unscrupulous method, and the audience outside the audience was a bit of noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Major Cousin, exit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The navy lieutenant breathed a sigh of relief. In the end, the raid was not all fruitless, killing the opponent's long-range firepower...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lieutenant Condé! Sergeant Campbell! Raymond Sergeant! Hano Lie! Sergeant Milano! Sinnar Lieutenant! The above six exits!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He jerked back and saw a The young, unremarkable lieutenant is cutting the fireball of the fourth flamingo. The flames of the flamingo have eliminated the fire enchantment on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rebel... traitor! Are you so concerned about your own points?" The navy lieutenant named Senaler gnawed his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door; Lieutenant Soleilton sighed at the sigh of the exit: "But I am attached to the staff. Since you did not expel me in time, it is yours." Mistakes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a buzzing sound on the sidelines, mixed with the slogan "Egan, shameless, shameless, Eugen!" The lieutenant colonel's face was still the expression of the sling, shrugged and walked toward the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, no matter what, we won. This kind of game is to use all methods to win. Well done, lieutenant, you performed well. The task of a spy. How many points are there now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the spy was heard, the brow of the door was wrinkled and hesitated before answering: "15 points. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Then the individual game... Let's get started?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Europe The root suddenly put a short spear in his hand to a flamingo at the foot of the foot, but unfortunately this did not even spurt the flames, destroying his sneak attack plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was shocked, and he stepped back, took his pistol from his arms, and lowered his arm and immediately shot at several nearby firebirds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Six-tube?! This gun is really good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facebird The cross-fire flames ejected, Eugen did not return, and the palm of his hand waved, and the force field came out, taking advantage of the momentum to skip the flames that were only sprayed at the ground level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oops!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left foot kicked a flamingo with six tubes in hand The pistol rang three times, piercing the firebird's fire sac, and the flames slanted upwards, aiming to take the European fundamentals; and the lieutenant colonel's hand was soft, dispelling the invisible force field, and the short spears were thrown out. I flew over the ear of the young lieutenant and pierced a flamingo fireball behind him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is stunned. At that moment, the Lieutenant Colonel did not use tricks and did not use wisdom. He saw that there was no laziness or slack in the face of the Lieutenant Colonel, but it was full of sharpness - just like a sharp-edged blade! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the true face of this lover? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resist in the door, exit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the surprise of the spear, The door was convincingly left the stadium. 19 points, he is content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only two people left on the field, and the only eleven firebirds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, you are the last lieutenant colonel." Now there are 18 points of the Viscount Rasta holding a flamingo in front of each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To each other. I have long estimated that you should stay in the end. It is the elite of the empire... Do you want to test it? Don't know our Who is better with the special combat forces and yours?" Behind the speaker's name, he also wrote "18". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lieutenant colonel thought about it: "It should be a bottle of 44 years of champagne... Of course, I have to fix it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh...44 years Champagne is the year of the fourth free war. Next, we don't bother with the force or the shield, how?" Count Rasta lowered the voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, let's get started." Eugen immediately threw out his first firebird and let the flames spurt Rasta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paladin seems to have been prepared, and the flames have been avoided on one side; the flame of the flamingo in his hand is shot at a very smashing angle. To the Lieutenant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm...you have insight? Yes!" Although the mouth praised, Eugen did not idle, the second and third two firebirds at the same time Throwed out, the left hand with a pistol on the arm shot through the fire sac, the right hand pierced with a short spear, with a crossfire to attack Rasta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The viscount fell backwards, and the flamingo on the other hand was used as a cover, and two rounds were hit on the ground to escape the opponent. Offensive. When they re-arranged their postures, they realized that there were only two flamingos left in each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am 21, you are also 21...there are only 4 points left on the field, and the duel still wastes 1 point. How is it enough?" Russ The tower waved his hand and pierced the fireball of a flamingo, letting the flame burn on himself. "I abstain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I follow up." Eugen smiled a bit and made the same move, saying that he abstained. Then, it was the cheer of Captain Itis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the game, Lieutenant Colonel Eugen appeared again on the viewing platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The officers and men of the Free Army! Everyone is very hungry? Then, our roasting flamingo feast is about to begin!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live!!!" The hungry soldiers immediately excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, please dine!" Eugen waved, and the whole anecdote even pushed the dining car, big and small, into the field. Then, everyone saw the long-awaited roasting flamingo...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......The fire that was penetrated by various things such as spears, lead shots, darts, rays, etc. bird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, this is for a reason. Because...there is something wrong with that abominable logistics department... This year we actually didn’t have a budget for roasting flamingos. The firebird that I just played is actually squeezed out from the rations of all of you. Please bear with the brave free officers and soldiers! Work hard to carry forward the spirit of our Free Army and eat these things!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, almost everyone was in the abdomen logistics department. Everyone continues to be silent, as far as possible not to let dissatisfaction be reflected in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door; Lieutenant Soleilton felt a chill behind him - the bitter cold, even standing next to the campfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis patted his shoulder sympathetically: "It’s not your fault. It’s Eugen’s waywardness. I shouldn’t have hosted the Firebird Contest this year. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it is my responsibility not to take into account this extra consumption." Nanimen stared at the flamingo that was shot by a musket in front of him, shaking I shook my head. "I will remember this mistake... It’s just a firebird. There will be no second logistical error anymore. I swear. Let everyone blame me... I have no objections."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at his depression, the captain shook his head and turned away; after a moment, she returned with her own prize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"砰!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Champagne opened 21 years ago, the wooden stopper flies like a bullet In the upper half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To achieve today's victory, the greatest credit is still to be lieutenant to Lieutenant Leiden. If he is not a spy, we will probably lose. Let us Lieutenant and our victory, cheers!" Itis raised the glass, loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
