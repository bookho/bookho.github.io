			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The route between the Intra-Narrow Sea and the Far South Port and the Phase Port<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political capital of the Republic of Intra-Real, Far South City, was established during the reign of the Hengping Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who conquered the land and built the city, named it Taiping. The builders expect it to become the capital of the peace-harding country, and then let the glory of the universal path spread across the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its shape was established with reference to the capital of Shuntian, located in the northern plains of the Eastern Empire. In order to defend against attacks from the sea, Yuannan City, like Shuntian, is located in a quasi-inland position more than 30 kilometers from the sea. In order to ensure the connection of the capital to the sea, rivers and canals, it is connected to the highest level of the Royal Highway, which is now the Far South Port. In order to prevent the harassment of the Berman pirates, there are towering retaining walls and continuous beacons on both sides of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that, hundreds of years later, no one needs these beacons anymore. The long walls of these defenses have been adorned and immersed in the grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The descendants of the Coman Marauders have established their own fleets, and their overseers have become the most heavily valued military advisers to the new Daoist. The latest news is no longer needed to pass through these beacons, but is quickly transmitted to the locals through the network between magic users. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seventh Fleet’s Marine Cavalry was leading the way, and Colonel Schlopp Cliff led the Army’s Guards in the back, walking with him. Lieutenant Colonel Hull Tedwood, Special Envoy of the Free Army Headquarters. Among the naval and army soldiers, the former national guards, the temporary parliamentary parliamentary general, the Federal Party’s Sam Webster, and his entourage and several fellow horsemen’s coaches. At the end of the team, at the forefront of the Army Cavalry, it was the young Superintendent of the Intrepid Army, wearing the red one-sleeved military uniform, Major Neremon Soledon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Major Solton and Webster passed over the Royal Road, they were prepared to be invited to board the flagship of the Marshal Wei Taiping in the Far South Port. The news that the Conservative Party’s plot was defeated in parliament has spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that arrived was the message from the Archbishop of the Reformed Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie Sefer’s letter of magic is encrypted with magical techniques. When received, it will burn like a light ray, in front of the right eye. Come out with a holy light, you will never admit your mistakes and believers. There are not many casters who have the ability to use the magic to encrypt the Arcane. The only one that will directly pass the letter to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations won the first round, we have begun to prepare stocks and bonds that we have absorbed at a low price before rallies these days. The profit should exceed 30%. After that, we will re-stabilize the price. If anyone has doubts, you will put my name on it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message is divided into two parts, all with God Encrypted to ensure that only Bonnie’s personally blessed people can receive it. In the free countries, few people are willing to confront the Bonnie Sefer, who has been destined to rule the religious world for many years, but there are too many people who are highly vigilant about the current and future female figures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But be careful, opponents won't give up as simple as this. We have built alliances, but others have patience. Even three or five years, they I will also try to penetrate this route. If you are curious about what they can do, look at the memory in your hand and ask Cleveland. Although she does not necessarily remember all the relevant information, she can still Give you a reference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the door was listening to the information sent by Bonnie, the Webster Member on the side had just stepped off the carriage. Although not very good at magic, but seeing the door to press the finger on the ear, he also knows that it is receiving the action of directional communication magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fast speed, or direct magic! Must be the news of the big partner in Palo Alto."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old senator is correcting his own appearance, wearing a pure white curly wig and listening to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You guessed it right. After all, I and Colonel Cliff are just the ones that sent the big man to fall in Murrayman's pawn. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not like the smooth return of the parliamentary order, to rebuild the words of the "Devil Sam" of the phase of the Hong Kong Council."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound with an oriental accent is more than the interjection The person himself arrived earlier. The Navy Marshal Wei Taiping had already set off the horse, arranged the ferry, and personally came to meet the passengers. Although he is only ten years younger than Webster, the shape of the Marshal is seemingly much stronger. Years of hard sea life, left him with a grim and angular face, a pair of bloodshot eyes, and a muscle like a knife and axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Archbishop of Sefer has been eager to start looting the ships of the far south of the gang? She is a natural pirate on the exchange. The Fischer, the real pirate, grabbed the money and didn’t have her people.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people who have great interests in the route company are surrounded by the Guard and the entourage In the middle, walked to the ferry boat and walked to talk about the consequences of this special parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean the commander of the Kazan Fisher Fleet? He does not look like a pirate."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistance recalled the fidelity lieutenant with gold glasses, a dark gold moustache, and even a slide ruler with him. Lieutenant General Fisher will be the person in charge of negotiating on behalf of the Seventh Fleet and the Route Company. It took a total of 35 percent of the proceeds and took away the trade rights of a large number of vessels. To say that he is a university professor, it is more convincing than saying that he is a pirate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Seventh Fleet can dominate the East, but the pirates are indispensable. Even Marshal Wayne himself is relying on Zhang Futu to rob the Eastern Empire and Pazhou. Then he turned over and went to the fleet of Hua Chao to rob Zhang Futu, and then established the foundation of the Seventh Fleet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear Webster talks about his past The history of Wei Taiping resolutely retorted: "For so many years, your old guy is still so unobtrusive. Even if we are all shareholders, I really can't get along with you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same feeling. If it is not for the Conservatives who are thinking about overwhelming the Shuanggang, I really don’t want the Marshal’s betrayal to use our phase port as the home port. The burden is too Heavy. Once the black ship is suppressed, I still hope that you can go back to Lingyangmen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But before that, I need to supplement my loss. In the sea battle of the West Longhai, the Seventh Fleet suffered heavy losses, but Intel The parliament has so far only repaid a sum of money..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the two elders in front of them began to talk about the various contents of the navy and appropriations, Slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a certain distance, he put his hand into his jacket pocket and touched the gap in his pocket to touch the blue gem that was stored in Anne Sefer’s memory. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you remember the story of Shrope Cliff in your future, Anne?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Anne in the gems replied in a no-floating tone: "Let's not Anne's memory for you to look at it. The history of Anne's memory is not complete, her history is not very good." Well, the Schlopp Cliff once conquered the Green Bull House and was promoted to the Lieutenant General, but was dismissed by the parliament a few years later and confiscated all property. He resigned from the military in an angry manner, in Zhang Shiyi’s master After serving in the court, he died in the war near the mountain range several years later..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the explanation of the memory gem, Nana suddenly understood why Bonnie Sey Phil will be so keen to push the expedition to Murrayman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that she is also a successful case of plagiarism in history... No wonder Zhang Futu will finally retreat so decisively, and Qingniu House looks downwind like that. Anne and Bang Nie, I already knew that Daoguo had already reached the edge of changing the dynasty..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually grabbed Cliff’s original credit, which made Naimen feel A little uncomfortable; at the same time, he is also a bit secretly glad that these two people will always stand on his side. People who know the history of the future will feel much safer in their own camps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way I am like a bad person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but mention it in his mind A question: "Do you know Dubreu Gauh? Does he die from this battle in your history?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this answer did not relieve him much. For whatever reason, so many people are still dead in this speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do in your original history? Or, would I have come to the country?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not the memory of Anne, but it seems that Zhang Yishi has visited the Holy Empire many times..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; resistance door is head down, listening to the sound of the memory, and suddenly, a powerful arm suddenly stopped his way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The overseer will be able to fall into the sea before going forward. The ferry is here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Wei Taiping stood at the end of the trestle and held his shoulder. The door jerked up and realized that he was standing on the trestle and was busy pulling his hand out of his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Navy Marshal frowned, squinted, with a questioning look on his face: "What magic is it studying? So focused?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, just some news coming along the magic net."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Taiping touched her own The gray is short, the eyes are narrower, and it seems that there is still light shining from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marshal’s captain reveals a smile that you know I know: “Ah, some news. It’s almost as fast as the big man. It’s not a country. The one... ah, the young man is really good.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old navy laughed and pushed the door to the liaison boat. Resist the door and stretch his hand into the pocket, holding Annie's memory gem tightly, for fear of accidentally falling into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his wolverine, the old Webster old members who had already boarded the dinghy smiled; and the two at the helm of the dinghy wore the navy The blonde and female navy in uniforms laughed out in a "grid", and several other sailors who were responsible for paddling also turned their heads aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, don't laugh, start!" Marshal Wei Taiping jumped into the dinghy and waved his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boat quickly left the port and approached the fleet that was moored in the Far South Port. This fleet is of course far less than the entire fleet of the Seventh Fleet that was parked a few months ago. At best, it is the size of a sub-fleet. There are less than 20 large ships and thirty or forty other ships. And armed with merchant ships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the small number of ships, the door quickly saw the ship they were about to board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the boat is particularly conspicuous under the surrounding boats. What's more, the top of the mast of this ship is also flying the flagship flag of the Seventh Fleet and the command flag of Marshal Wei Taiping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the Marshal's ship not a flat wave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the door is blurted out. When he attacked the Elf Embassy in Phase Port, he saw Wei Taiping’s command ship “Pingbo” and also saw the first ship’s “Broken Wave”. These two ships are three-deck, heavy-duty battleships with over 100 guns. But this ship has four layers of artillery decks, obviously neither. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the four decks that Nami has seen and even killed on it. The last time he boarded the ship, its name was "Heavy Supply Ship", which was used to hold a large ship for the banquet. He also remembers that the naval officer who was chatting at the time vowed to him that such a large ship was too slow and too inflexible to be suitable for naval warfare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, no one answered his question. After a long silence, Marshal Wei Taiping personally opened his mouth and answered his questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Pingbo is no longer in the fleet. The Broken Wave is also not in the fleet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At that time, the "Western" had laid down a ladder for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the ship itself, is already answering this question for the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the largest ship in the fleet, it was misappropriated as a banquet ship, banqueting the most famous celebrities in the port. Inside and outside the warships, there is a magical glow; all the magical abilities of the guests are combined to arm several of the best freelancers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, if the ship is parked in the Far South Port, if it does not have four decks and a huge body, the door will simply not recognize it. At night, in the Gulf of Phases, the battleship is like a dream world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks like a broken ship that is about to be towed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outer hull is covered with craters. Numerous barnacles and algae slammed up the bottom of the ship, crossing the fourth, third and second layers of the artillery deck until the edge of the first layer of the artillery deck barely stopped. The original oak hull of a water became a hull that was assembled with variegated wood that did not know where it came from...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even those dozens of faces Almost the Red Red Fleet's proud red firefighting sails have also become sails with gray dim canvas, even the most important main jibs and square sails. Only a dozen bright red fire sails were mixed in between, and barely proved its identity as the first ship of the Red Fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship is still that powerful ship, but it is only a change in appearance, making it look old and many. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How could this be? From the last time I saw it, it only took a few months to go?! What happened?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After stepping onto the deck and looking around, the door was screamed. Not only the outer deck, but every piece of wood on the ship seems to have passed through the time--that is definitely not the damage that can be caused in a few months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing this ship, Webster is also showing some mental impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that our funding is really limited. But I don't think you should deliberately look for these bad materials to fix it; Is this intentionally ugly to us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old parliamentarian said half of it and reacted violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. If you want to fix so many places, this boat should have been sunk for a long time. It is impossible to return this way. Marshal, what is going on here? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of the Ghost Fleet. This ship was taken away by the Ghost Fleet of the Black Sail and then taken back by one of our main ships. We also I really want to fix it, but I don’t need too much money to repair such a ship. We need to guard the enemy fleet at all times and we can’t withdraw it from the fleet.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A young male who was harder than Wei Taiping’s accent answered them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw this person, Wei Taiping looked around and hurried forward, angered: "Buwu! I did not say that I would like to arrange a welcome! It’s Mr. Wei, and this is the Soyrian ambassador. The people who had specially transferred this boat were to welcome them. What do you say when you come here to say these beautiful scenery!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The young officer wearing a naval school gown and wearing the rank of captain of the colonel snorted, and Tie Qing clap his hands and clap his hands and call the order in the oriental language. He seems to be a mixed-race, with the facial features of the Orientals, and the dark skin. Before the eyebrows, it looks a bit like Wei Taiping, but there are not so many deep grooves left by the sea breeze on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Taiping reprimanded him two times and turned around to introduce: "This is my flagship captain, the dog Wei Buwu." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard that the young man in front of him is the son of Marshal Wei Taiping, and Sorlayton and Webster are slightly surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this your son? It’s an excellent navy." Mr. Webster greeted him, "Buwu... I want to use the name of our language." Is Bruce Wayne?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Buwu snorted again: "I am a fan of words. I don't want the name of your language." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is just twenty years old this year, my third son, the young man was born in Lingyangmen, young and vigorous, unlike I often sail around the world." When Wei Taiping said these words, he looked like an ordinary father. "If it is not by my position, he probably won't get the position of captain. However, during the last naval battle, he was still very heroic." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This topic..." Wei Taiping nodded. "It’s better to sit down on the lower deck and eat some afternoon tea according to Mr. Webster’s habit. After the last naval battle, we have repaired the two months. On the second deck, the old view was reluctantly restored."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his introduction, the female navies responsible for guiding and receiving were also on the top deck and arranged in a row. The wall leading to the second deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was somewhat surprised to note that all these young female navies, although not all of them are national colors, they have a unified character - —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All are blondes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All female navies have a golden hair, no matter how beautiful or ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After discovering this situation, Nermen felt that the sweat on his head was flowing down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to ask questions several times, but he still can’t ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think, this advance transfer is also for...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Taiping seems to have noticed his Hey, take the initiative to say: "Ah, Soretta's Warlord has made you notice. In the recent voyage, we tried to save all the blondes that can be bought along the coast, but all the suspicious blondes. Young girls, we also tried to persuade them to join the fleet. Since you have been looking for it once, the church’s big man has also collected it for you, then our entire fleet, and all the captains associated with the Eastern Route, will do their part. Completed this commission. The blonde girls who were collected and whose identity could not be confirmed were all on this 'western'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is really unknown What to say is good. He really wanted to confirm Anne Saffir in the blonde girl who had lost her memory, but she thought that his allies collected the blonde girl and felt extremely embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, he noticed that some of the blonde girls were sluggish and seemed to have been manipulated by spiritual magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Taiping is like reading his heart and continues to explain: "Ah, spiritual magic is not what our people do. It is because of these blondes. The girls were manipulated with spiritual magic, and we suspected that they might be the great man in the church and the goal you want to find. In order to prevent errors in the process of lifting, we simply trained the basic fighting knowledge and abilities of these blonde girls. The work of disarming and inquiring about memory is believed to be better for your gendarmerie and the big man. Of course, all this is just a matter of our hands. When Major Solton is at the phase port, you can take this boat. The blonde girl is all taken away..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to describe the feeling of the door, it’s like being tied up, then tied the stone and throwing it into the endless Like the ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these people still say that this is his own will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, this is definitely jumping into the endless ocean immediately and can’t be washed out...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “How many people are the blonde girls collected by everyone?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is crowded out again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, about 1300 people, it will almost make this boat work." Wei Taiping laughed. "In order to prevent accidents, I have tried to The male sailors and officers and men have been transferred away, I believe you can understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Buwu snorted again, using a kind of watching the kind of drama The expression of ignorance and ignorance is looking at the door, and the face is full of disgust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened his mouth and thought about it, but still said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's talk about the sea battle of Xi Qian Long Hai."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weber Under the guidance of two blonde sailors, Mr. Stuart took a comfortable sofa and sat down, and changed the topic in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Taiping’s expression suddenly became serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it is absolutely impossible to be the fleet of the empire. Even in the evil Holy Coman Empire, they will not allow such magical techniques to be massive Use. That will only lead to everyone's self-risk, the whole rule is on the verge of extinction, just like the end of the elf empire, or the period of shamanism and invasion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remembered the strange words that the former Marshal said. "The magic they used, is it just said by Captain Buwu... 'Ghost ship'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Taiping sighed: "Yes. That is a horror story that we often hear when we sail on the high seas. In the legend, the ghost ship is the product of the unwilling rebellion of the wrecked ship and the crew. When the merchant ship is on a single trip or is traveling in a small formation on the open sea If you can't beat them, the ship and the crew will be controlled by these undead and become a new ghost ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Every ship is pinned with great expectations and numerous investments, and the magical souls that can form horror can be understood." The door nodded. "Many magical phenomena are made up of such negative beliefs." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Webster took a sigh of relief and couldn’t help but look around at the seemingly dilapidated planks: "Is it all that is on board?" Old traces are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is exactly the case.” Wei Taiping sighed, “This ship was once defeated and captured by the ghost ship. What is even more terrible is that... On that day, there were more than a few ghost ships on the West Dragon’s sea. That’s A whole fleet of former imperial vessels controlled by the ghost ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A whole fleet of ghost ships." Resist the door and couldn't help repeating it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he said this, the temperature in the entire deck seemed to have dropped, and several sailors were shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When we reacted, the entire battle center was completely broken by the Ghost Ship fleet. Their erratic movement broke through our fleet and the Elf fleet. The defense also exceeded the expectations of the warring parties. When the enemy's first breakthrough was completed, we were surprised to find that the number of ships hijacked by the Ghost Ship fleet has reached one quarter of the total number of warships. I better The ship, as well as the best boat of Dray Wayne Mandrill, was taken away by the ghost ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Webster from the couch Bounced up: "In the report to the parliament, there is no mention of the possession of the body!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door also reacted: "So you just Will it be said that the two ships are no longer in the fleet?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Later on that day, the battle was not really big for us and the elves. The battle of the fleet. We have actually ceased fighting on both sides... If we continue, all the ships will become secluded The food of the fleet. The rest of the mission is to recapture the ships that were plundered by the ghost ship and to rescue the ships and seafarers who are trapped in the ghost ship. These, of course, will not be written in our logbook."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the result will be no match."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exactly, I and Man Derry lost. The empire also lost, and the loss was the most thorough. Their expedition fleet was completely destroyed by the mysterious ghost ship fleet; and we and the elves were taken away by half of the ships. Until now, I I don't know where the fleet is sacred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand. It is really difficult to explain to the parliament... but it must be explained. I will try to give you Granted more fleet reconstruction funds." Webster frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Taiping smiled bitterly: "In fact, this is the main reason why I strongly support your route company. We can no longer afford internal consumption. Who is I don't know what the ghost ship fleet wants to do. They may appear at any time and completely block the sea between us and Murrayman and Huachao. We must maintain a fleet to deal with their threats."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, how can we recapture a ship controlled by a ghost ship? How can we avoid a ship being controlled by a ghost ship? Since this ship was taken back The Guardian Marshal should be very clear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the question of the door, Wei Taiping explained: "It’s very simple. Kill the ship by connecting the ship. All the undead creatures that control the ship can take back a boat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
