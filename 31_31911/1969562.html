Don't die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reesa rushed down Next to the blonde girl in the ground, she kneeled on one knee and explored her breath. There is still breathing, but the eyes are tightly closed. She hurriedly took the healing potion from under the robes and poured it into Anne's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm..." The blonde girl who drank the potion struggled a few times and slowly opened her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alchemist’s heart trembled slightly. A few months ago, she seemed to have seen a similar scene... She looked away and wanted to dispel this unlucky association from her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze of the move, happened to sweep onto a tall trainee priest's hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there is one difference. Here is the world of civilization - this ship has the presence of a pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nop... Mr. Knopp, come over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that there was some horror The shouts, the trainee pastor Nopp turned back and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well... there really is only one woman. The woman who shines with golden light on her body...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just... did you call me, Ms. Hermont...?" He tempted ask. He still can't believe that the panicked female voice will be sent out by the "golden alchemist of pure gold" who has been smelled by the whole ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Less nonsense! Hurry up, trainer pastor!" Reza's tone restored the indifference and momentum of the weekdays. "My slave a is hurt!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor of the trainee sneaked over and squatted to check Anne; Seifer’s injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"cure light!" The white light that had already gathered in his hand was fleeting. "It may be a bit sinister...but I want to know how she was injured?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza has a red face and scornfully replies: "This... first It fell from the top of the mast, then flew flat, and finally hit the force... Hey, hit the extremely hard metal. Is the situation serious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This..." Nopp brows and hesitates, seemingly thinking about how to word. "If this is the case, actually..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact... ...Miss Anne seems to have suffered nothing, I feel very strange. If she really falls from such a high place, luck is really not good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Almost at the same time, the blonde girl made a "snap", opened her eyes and woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well...a little pain..." She sat up and rubbed her head. "Sorry, the master, I am worried about you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啪"! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before she finished, Reza’s right hand slammed on Annie’s left face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are my property, you have to be aware of the property! Don't mess around next time, I don't want to go to the place where no one wants to slip into the property." Take a nap, such a boring reason suffers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Anne; Seifer held her left face and was completely stunned. Tears unconsciously twirled in her eyes, and she tried to suppress it and prevent them from flowing out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza no longer speaks and turns away. After a moment, her golem was left behind with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nopp looked at the blonde girl sitting in the ground in a dull manner, feeling a little unbearable, persuaded: "You don't care too much. She is cold on the face, but still in her heart I am very worried about you. When you didn't wake up, she was very anxious..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just?" Nopp was a little confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just... I didn't expect to be slapped for the first time in this situation. Life is like a storm, right?" Anne Sefer broke into laughter and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha?" The trainee pastor is puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wind has just changed." Annie looked up and looked at the clouds in the sky. "The situation has changed. Do you want to hide?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The southwest trade wind is still blowing quietly, and the wind has increased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Klein Emperor" sail has three or five small bullet holes. However, due to the increase in wind power, the speed of the ship is not slower than it was just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Refill!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Light cannon suppresses shooting! Repeat it, light cannon suppresses shooting The light cannon elevation angle is 19.5 degrees, 19.5 degrees!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy ship sails! The long guns test the enemy ship hull!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The command from the commander’s command room was passed on the upper and lower artillery decks. Obviously, the iron wall admiral has adjusted the combat target to the enemy ship that has not yet entered the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"4 rounds of shelling, 10 to 2 hit rate... Was he not a division commander before? The captain’s experience is also very good."<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the character of the captain is completely incompatible, Leonard has to admit that as the captain of the Ferron; Letonsti is indeed very strong. According to this battle, the words of Fei Long may not be realized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A burst of frustration rushed into his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s good to win without a pick-up battle...but he just feels a bit wrong. In the depths of his inner secret, he even hopes that pirates can do more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I went out to change my tone and look at the situation." Leonard absently dropped the sentence and walked out of the hatch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can feel the gaze behind his back. The gaze is hidden deep, but he can feel it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The offshore fleet is much better than the distant sea fleet." The captain’s gaze is so proud, "You are all dregs."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elves went out, the southwest trade wind blew his pale yellow hair...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Southwestern trade wind? No... ..." Leonard; Kakawi jerked his head up and rushed onto the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw that the other party was changing the sail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath - he identified the god The breath that is casually blown out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind has changed! From the southwest wind to the east wind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God's mischief...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not God...but people . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world, there has never been a god of mischief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind master...!wind master!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;windwind (windrol), Can change the magic of the wind direction. The half-elves smelled the prelude to this wind change - but it was too late to deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A pirate, how can there be such a thing..." The ominous premonition in his heart is getting stronger and stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The wind that the magic blows, have you seen it, Elf? Let us cheer for the borrowed Dongfeng." Carl Ben; black robe standing wearing The bow of the Nobel, raised a glass of fine wine found on the passenger ship, and wished in the direction of the Emperor Kleon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six-sided cross-sail that was still full of southwest winds at the moment was hit by Dongfeng. The "Kleon Emperor" was full of sails and slammed back. Rebound to the other side of the original. This is a fatal blow for the cross-boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge reaction force was imposed on the ship, the helmsman could no longer hold the rudder, and the whole boat made a turn in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the shells that were fired lost their heads and strengths and fell into the sea in a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five minutes! Take the east wind off the sail and let the starboard turn to the enemy ship!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Mark; Blackbeard dropped the windy scroll that had been turned into ashes and rushed onto the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, the southwest trade wind suddenly turned into a easterly wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, the original superiority suddenly became a disadvantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main spinnaker of the "Black Trojan" has already been transferred to the direction of the East Wind, by which it draws a three-quarters of the sea. The arc came to the top of the "Kleon Emperor". His helmsman was already ready, slamming along the strength of the east wind, slanting toward the elf sailing ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the artillery that has been loaded with chain bullets on the starboard side, fire! The mainsail of the target enemy, now they will reverse the sail, temporarily unable to act!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest advantage of the schooner is that it can be used more than a cross-sail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artillery shells connected by chains, with the orders of the pirate captain, accurately hit the sails of the suddenly stalled Emperor Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a chain bullet that is designed to destroy the shells of the other side's sails and masts. The chain of a pair of chain bullets happened to be wrapped around the rear mast of the "Kleon Emperor"; with the huge roar, the huge mast of the giant wood was broken with a bang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the break! It can't be repaired at the moment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The main sail is slightly damaged!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The front sail is broken!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The vessel stalls, now sailing two knots!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because the front sail, the mainsail is broken, the rudder process slows down, you may not be able to escape the enemy's next shelling!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this series of bad reports, Ferron; Leton Sti slammed from the seat and his teeth creaked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The damn pirate... change the right full rudder, cut to the other side of the bow, the starboard full force fire! Before they rushed up, the grape bombs and the incendiary bombs waited Don't let them go back alive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, but another enemy ship is approaching the first one, should we..." Stop the extremely angry sergeant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't take another boat, first sink this ship that humiliated me! Go all out!" The iron wall admiral has already thrown his graceful grace. When he arrived in the clouds, his anger broke out completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people! These pirates! Even dare to despise the fleet of Sansen... with the magic that can only be effective for five minutes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will ask you to pay the price! Open fire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order under his anger is also Also got faithful execution. All the artillery of the Emperor Klein fired together and smashed all the accumulated grape and incendiary bombs on Mark's ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf battleship guns are more advanced than the pirate guns - these are enough to make the pirate's superiority invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the four-door cannon on the starboard side turned the unfortunate sloop into a battlefield of fire and explosion. "Kleon Emperor" is indeed one of the strongest battleships in the open sea - this is not one or two magic can be changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no artillery to fire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Brig" type has only one layer of artillery deck. This layer of artillery deck has been completely covered by black smoke and flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two minutes...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rotary! Steer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mainsail is on fire...!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirates cried and shouted into the sea and did not jump in. They have all become the souls of the dead under the shells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One minute...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abominable! Abandon ship!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even with the upper hand, Mark’s sailboats can’t move any more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Southwestern trade winds blow up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time as the end of the effectiveness of the wind, the "black trojan" was permanently sunk into the bottom of the sea under Ferron’s angry shelling, turning into a huge Swirl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark ordered to put down the lifeboat and hurriedly jumped in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the shadow cast by the main wing of the "Quasi Angel" appeared in front of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Mark’s vessel as a bait, the “Quasi Angel” successfully crossed the dominant range of the “Kleon Emperor” and entered its own dominant range. region. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf's artillery advantage is thus invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kezmi; Stewart held the first "kit" in his hand, muttering to himself: "How does that black robe know?" The other party won't shoot us? Did he specifically send the 'black trojan' as a bait..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, Mark asked us on the lifeboat A little slowdown, he wants to get on the boat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pirate ran in, and he saw Mark walking along the lifeboat to the "quasi-angel". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He doesn't know how to take care of the big picture! We must now sink the enemy with all our strength - although we have entered the effective battle zone, the opponent's gun is still more than us. Ah!" Katzmi sneaked at the corner of his mouth, clenched the remaining two tips and gave orders. "Don't care about Mark! Let's fire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss! Mark He has been with you for several years..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if he is on the way forward, we must rush over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark; Black Beard soon discovered that even if he was fully rowing, It is also inseparable from the sailing route of the quasi angel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dinghy immediately under the impact of a giant ship Fragmented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Karben... You used me as a pawn that you can sacrifice..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He used all his last effort to tear the smash into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Farewell, Captain Mark. I told you long ago, don't be too impatient." Carl Ben; black robe quietly poured the glass of wine Into the sea, "Okay, I should start preparing here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reporting the captain, the enemy ship has begun to sink!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this report, Ferron’s anger began to calm down, and the unpleasant feeling of “a bitten by a dying dog” faded a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it too pleasant?" A moment of uneasiness began to rise in his heart. If the other side is prepared for the wind, is it a special sacrifice to the No. 2 ship that does not make much sense? If so...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
