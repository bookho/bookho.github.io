At noon, Bonnie ordered the guards to fight the flag of the bank of the Cross brothers, and changed the low-key when they marched on the east bank of the king's river, and swayed to the south gate of Kengal. Seeing that they marched so arrogantly, the guards guarding the South Gate did not dare to neglect, and sent a deputy company commander with a whole row to pay respectfully and politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are invited by the Jurassic Law Society to perform a charity performance in Kengal for the peace of our country. This is a girl genius. The famous organ and pianist Metsey; Miss Crosso."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie, who is a housekeeper; Seifer said seriously to the defenders. When he heard the name of the largest Protestant group in the country, the deputy company commander did not find a reason to block. After the end of the routine inspection, he also deliberately set aside several soldiers to lead the team to the headquarters of the Law Society, St. Warrens Cathedral. Before and after the door of the cathedral, she let the soldiers leave and walked to the main car door of the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Crosso, we arrived at the destination." Bonnie's voice was light and the female voice was restored. Within the entire team, only Metty knew Bonnie’s female identity. When she was discussing with George; Crosso, she was very responsible for persuading the banker to let his daughter go with her as a person in charge of "pure gold" - Bonnie suspected that if she was not a woman herself, George; Crowso would rather choose bankruptcy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the negotiation, the serious banker repeatedly screamed at her, and she was optimistic that she had not left Metty outside Lenny. At that time, Bonnie was full of mouths - because she didn't know that a arrogant 16-year-old lady was so difficult...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have arrived? Here is Ken Geller, Kengler, Kengler!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the eager and excited cry, the door was pushed open and slammed The ground hit the forehead of the strongest Protestant pastor on the ground. Bonnie hurriedly held down the top hat and took a forehead and stepped back two steps. The usual style was gone. The lovely blonde girl didn't even look at her, and ran up the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral. Seeing this scene, the whispering whisper broke out among the guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I feel like I was cheated by history... this Metty; Crosso is really... one of the first generation of blood rose...)<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steward of the men’s clothing is thinking in the heart, telling the guards to be optimistic about the team, and striding forward with Metty to the cathedral at the top of the steps. She had to rush to the cathedral before Metty had a conflict with the priests of the cathedral, otherwise there would be big trouble... At this time, Bonnie found that she had miscalculated another thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde girl in high heels and a dress skirt is as light as a wind across the sixty-six steps in front of St. Warrens Cathedral. Bonnie has never seen it, and I have never imagined that people wearing high heels can run so fast, so quickly - even wearing pants and riding boots, using the perfect body customized by magic, she can't catch up with the girl's pace. Metty rushed through a group of debated pastors, knocked down a book administrator with a big book, interrupted the prayers of several honest believers, and ran into the church without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Meddy; Crosso, the first generation of purple roses... theorizing and systemizing musical magic, forming the Arbitration Association Musical Magic Department to limit this The use of magic... As a member of the right and left hands and the pioneers, their musical magic has outstanding performance in the fifth free war, the Koman revolution, and the restoration war, in the first generation of organizations. Responsible for the affairs of the South, with outstanding merits... Participated in the blockade plan for the enchantment of the outside world, with thoughtful thoughts and accurate calculations......)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie recalled the secret history of the organization On the introduction of Metty; Crosso, smiling and nodding his head and apologizing to the angry clerics. It has been so long since I returned to this era, she has not been so stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Is it because the fifth free war did not immediately erupt? What is it that made this innocent girl have such a big change in the history... Is that called fate?)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She decided not to take care of the lady’s own travel, and marched forward along the cloister on the left side of the church. St. Lawrence Cathedral is one of the oldest cathedrals in history. It was built in the 560th year of the standard calendar and its name comes from St. Sadie; Warrens. The church itself was handed over to the Protestant four factions after the Reformation. One of the ceremonies. After the classical white cloister of the White Council, it is the room where the highest director of the Law Society is in charge of the bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, respected priest." Bonnie took a letter from her jacket pocket, covered with a small blue seal, "Get in and inform the lord."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"sor...Innovation will be a priest...?" The priest asked a little strangely. As we all know, Protestantism does not have the same authoritative core as the Holy See. The most important organizational structure is the four major retreats of the believers: the society of the society (societydiscipline), the society of the church (societyaustereness), the provincial capital (societyintrospe, the association (society) ), plus more than a dozen medium-sized seminars - there is no name for the innovation conference.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your briefing is over, the bishop must Know." Bonnie smashed her hand. As an elite pastor of the later generations, it is necessary to break into the core class of Protestantism. It is better to use this training as a breakthrough...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Innovation (societyrefor, the only non-communist and low-level priests in the Protestant factions who are dedicated to the improvement of the magical technique. The number is small, but it represents the hope of the Protestant against the old religion.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 55 km southeast of Kengal in the early days of the day Neutral area<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team slowly moved forward, horseshoe stepping On the stub, on the In this season, the forest with almost no leaves looks brown-black, and the crows fly from it, some are gloomy. Seeing the large crows flying, the knights headed by the team pull the stables.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s weird. Uncle, you and the ladies are behind the house.” Xiu Lan waved to the gloomy man around him, both of whom waved the whip and ran towards the crow. Place.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, it’s already a very difficult thing to live to become an uncle..." Jeter; Nitton is somewhat dissatisfied Retorted, but Xiu Lan’s horses have disappeared into the Black Forest. After their horses passed, several crows flew up. The pastor’s uncle spread his hands and rolled over.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ladies, go slower, be careful with traps. The trap detection book will be used by me, but I don't guarantee that every trap can be detected."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, thank you." Yanika quietly clenched the newly bought scepter and answered nervously. The other female pastor just nodded in a hurry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is the seventh day since they accepted the mission, and the team is stranded south of Kengal. On the tenth day, I just received my second salary yesterday, and the financial difficulties of the team were once again alleviated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task is Parker; Tap is brought through the thieves union. The content of the mission does not sound difficult: to alert the suspicious people and robbers in the area to the area north of the Lenny Government military warning line, regardless of life or death, if there is additional compensation for bringing back the prisoners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But why is the thieves union?" At the time, I was curiously asked, "Is this task not a direct public commission?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably to prevent public criticism. After all, it cannot be said that the purpose of this mission is to cut off the supplies of the Northern Coup and the reconnaissance of the coup." The uncle explained to her. "Good pay, no advance payment, no blood, just do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because their team has four spell users, it's easy to pass After the screening of the guild, I got enough money to solve the urgent need. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adding the second salary yesterday, and the bounty of the suspicious captives in front, the money is almost enough for the team to use for half a month..." Renee, who was promoted to the team's account, was carelessly calculating the next cost. According to the current situation, as long as this task can still be done for ten days, the economic problems of the team can be solved. She did not bother to spend the day with Raf, she was very pleased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle, Miss Master, come over and see!" The shouts of Xiulan came from a distance, and the three hurriedly followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gathering of the crows is really for a reason. In the depths of the forest, it was originally a hidden road. The floating soil was covered with new wheel prints and horseshoe prints. A carriage fell to the side of the trail and was burned by fire; more than a dozen bodies were messed up near it, wearing different armor and costumes, and the body odor emanating led to the crow. Parker; Tap is kneeling beside the body and checking the body. Seeing this scene, Lei Fu; Miss Namlock some disgusted with a handkerchief licked her nose, and the horse retired two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, I do." Renee did not hesitate to roll over and squat down, and began to look at the wounds and burnt positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body scent rushed into her nose, only the 16-year-old girl just frowned. She secretly told herself that she was used to the stench. She must get used to this taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wounds are mainly gunshot wounds, but most are not fatal; the deadly ones are all spears. Yanika will focus the light of the left hand's detection near the wound, and there is no magic reaction. She noticed a detail: most wounds are pierced from behind or behind, which seems a bit strange. She focused her attention on fire injuries: the conclusions of this time are obvious. The same degree of burning in the range is obviously magic - the burn caused by the rocket or the torch must be uneven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One to two hours." Next to Parker; Tapu first spoke, "South."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncle Jett also came to the conclusion: "They have more than one carriage, they should be the people of the northern army. The one who died here is a team of mercenaries like us, about six people; the guards of the other side. It also lost four. If you walked south for one or two hours, you can catch up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is magic, but the level does not seem to be very high. "Niqueka also came to the conclusion that "the purpose of using flame magic may be to cover up, but it is not well concealed. But be aware that the other party may have a spearman with rich experience and quick action." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiu Lan frowned and turned to Lei Fu: "Ms. Let’s vote? The index finger is chasing, the middle finger is not chasing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five index fingers are erected and point to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later in the day Kengal St. Warrens Cathedral<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie pushes away The thick mahogany gate went into the room of the bishop. As soon as she entered the room, she saw a striking banner hanging on the wall facing me: "Discipline is unity and unity is power." An old man is standing at the bottom of the banner, facing away from her, as if reading the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not a lawsuit known for its tactics." Bonnie smiled a bit. She knew that 80% of the Free Army garrisons followed. The law of the law. In order to show respect to the bishop, she took off her hat and exchanged her voice for the true voice of the female voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most respected lord, a priest from the Innovation Society will see you here." She followed the etiquette rigorously. Unlike the Orthodox system, most of the teachers in Protestantism are equal, but they are changed according to age, seniority and status. Even an ordinary old pastor may have a tribute to the bishop or the bishop. Protestantism has only four levels of teaching: priests, patriarchs, bishops, and bishops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop placed the letter on the table, turned around and looked at her. "Are you a brother or a sister?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister." Bonnie decided not to lie to the old man, "from Lenny. This time, I have a Good news and a bad news bring you, and there are a few small things to ask for your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say good news," old man Answer, "Sor's good news must be inspiring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We already have complete treatment." Bonnie said faintly, "This is us." Innovation will be one of the greatest achievements since the Reformation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"砰", the teacup on the table fell underground and shattered. The old bishop's hands pressed on the table, trembled and tried to keep his body from falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I... can you take a look?" The old man asked with hope. "I hope that you will be this magic. Don't use it, let me look at it." Let's take a look at the beautiful sea blue light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be sure to follow the instructions." Bonnie stretched out her right hand and muttered the prayer and raised her index finger. . A slight blu-ray emerges from the tip of her index finger, followed by the middle finger, ring finger, and little finger. The blue light gradually darkens, becomes pure, and becomes clear. Like the endless sea, it extends downward from the tip of the four fingers, extending and extending until it covers the entire palm. The dazzling sea blue light covered the entire room. It was not until the light faded that the Archbishop took a long time to return to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bad news is that we haven't found any way to rely on the law to use this magic. We haven't found a way to rely on Park Road, introspection, and justification to use this magic." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop has indulged: "That... I can take the liberty to ask, how did you use this magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We followed the plural virtues and repeated introspection. Now, we don't know that those virtues can do this - but we have proven that this can be done Perhaps we can try to expand the content and scope of virtues... If we don’t stick to a dogma, we may be able to break through the barriers. Virtue brings a firm belief, a firm belief leads to a firm self-will, and self-will Bringing strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie carefully revealed the contents of the great work "The Principles of Divine Magic" that appeared more than a decade later. It can accommodate the freedom of others, not obeying the dogma, not only strictly demanding themselves, but also popularizing simple and simple ideas, correcting each other's mistakes, opening up the introspection of the mind, not only popularizing doctrine, but also popularizing the justification of justice, virtue and faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop has been stunned for a long while and finally smiled: "I think, I know how our law will be done in the future. Now, please tell me about you. If you have a request, you must follow it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie heard a big sigh of relief in his heart. She knows she is successful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, I need to borrow the organ, piano and sacred classes of St. Lawrence Cathedral, as well as the big chapel here. My lady is going to be here these days. There is a charity show here, and I hope you can help. Of course, my innovation will be a priesthood, and please keep more secrets." When she said the last sentence, she exchanged the man’s voice. "I hope to borrow the power of the martial arts. Ask as many people as possible from Kengler's celebrities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop is in a difficult situation: "Can you start tomorrow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie; Seifers thought for a moment and put on a top hat: "Also, but of course, the sooner the better. We have lived here for a few days, if you have chores, please Take care. Please tell the respectable priests, my name is Pluto; Luther, butler Bruto; Luther."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nodded, and stopped talking. In the end, he did not ask the name of the young princess himself, but he had already foreseen that the person in front would become the future Protestant star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, if your priest sees a cute blonde girl, it’s too gentle to bring her to my room. That’s us. The performer," she added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaving the team to settle down, Bonnie called a rental carriage and quietly left: "Go to the official residence of the Second Secretary of State."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nikolay; Lord Machiavelli?" Even the driver’s voice was accompanied by a tremolo. "That man is a pickpocket, do you know his past deeds?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, let's hear it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether chatting with the coachman She did not know that only half of the second secretary of state was at Kengler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time about 70 km southeast of Kengal Neutral area<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chasing out for half an hour After the journey, the rut finally came to an end and disappeared behind a sharp turn. The adventurers stopped behind the woods and listened to the movements nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sound around, silence to some point of repression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silent enchantment," 黛尼卡 whispered, "The two sides may be fighting..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; The voice just fell, a harsh muffled sound came. Renee turned her head and saw a magical arrow flashing yellow light inserted in the old tree next to it, straight to the feathers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Recumbent!" Xiu Lan whispered to her companion, and she rushed out from the other side of the tree. Almost at the same time, the two pastors each dropped a dispelling technique to break the silent enchantment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
