			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xi<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Russell’s Defense Minister of Defense Ladz; Marshal Govar is dead "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news caused a stir in the military and the government - it was destroyed in the pursuit of the "Lenny Great Detection Network" The turm caused by one of them is even bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of after-care does not say that the problem of light credit and accountability makes the whole system arrogant. No matter whether it is the Southwest Army system or the French Marquis system, no one can escape the responsibility. Admiral Betsy concentrated the main force on the North Gate and recognized the use of the internal blasting gun. He had to bear a lot of responsibility in this respect; but he finally decided to send a door to the door; Hull, who was chased by Solonton, could not escape. Lieutenant General Lopez, who has always been savvy and strong, has somehow been in a state of paralysis, which has aggravated the extent of the commotion. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such a chaos, Hull only had time to join the military of the door to the archives and was called by the parliamentary inquiries. The specific process of this inquiry was not known to the lieutenant in the headquarters of the military building, but it was also known as an extremely fierce political transaction conference with the cerebellum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final decision, nothing can be kept secret; that night, Lieutenant Colonel Hull came back with the final decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original military system was cancelled and the field forces were reunited. "Given that the two candidates are not suitable to perform their duties at this time," they asked Kongti; former Marshal Fox, who is not a former marshal, is in charge of the staff meeting. He will directly command a new organization called the "Central Army", which will go to receive and adapt the troops of the former Northern Army. The former Southwestern Army of Lopez changed from a provisional establishment to a formal preparation of the Western Army, and the rank was raised to the rank of general, responsible for the defense of the entire West and the South. The French army was reorganized into the Eastern Army. They allocated some troops to the Central Army and the Southwest Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end of the fourth free war, the Free Army finally compiled all the other marshals, two generals, and three troops. Twelve freelancers and six reserve divisions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western Army: Admiral Lopez. The current "Imiya" division, the tenth "Lenny" division, the sixth national "shooting" division. Should be governed by the sixth "Mattby West" division, the seventh "Southwest" division, the fourth national "Morning Star" division. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oriental Army: Admiral Betsy. Currently governing the third "Faus" division, the ninth "Central Mountain" division, the eleventh "Great Wasteland" division, the twelfth "Oss River" division, the second national "Trident" division, the third national "Double-edged sword" division. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Central Army: Marshal Fox. He is now in charge of the second "Intre" division, the first national "Machete" division, and the fifth national "Trenches" division. Should be in charge of the first "Republic" division, the fourth "San Sen" division, the eighth "Ruollock" division. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three military formations look the same, but in fact, at least half of the Western and Central Army forces are still in the ranks of the government. To this end, the existing units of the Third Division and the Ninth Division have been strengthened to give Lopez a new Lenni division, so that they have barely gathered a lineup of more than 20,000 people, and will soon go to the southwest to accept the seventh division. surrender. The Interview will also arrive in two or three days as the main force of the Central Army to travel to Ruslock to accept all the troops of the former Northern Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably this is the case. As for you... the last decision above is like this. For the final defeat of Govar, a three-level Medal of Freedom is awarded; You have destroyed the 'Lenni Big Detection Network' in combat missions and caused a huge number of friendly casualties. This medal will be recorded for a while, until one year later or next time. You may want to transfer to the center. Army.” Hull turned over the thick minutes of the meeting and picked out a few places that involved the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was slightly shocked: "The Central Army? Why not the Western Army?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Ah, that's because Robert replaced my position in the Western Army. The new Tenth Division is made up of the Fabians' forwards and needs to be familiar with the troops to sort out the preparation. I entered the Central Army. The reason is the same: the two divisions of the scimitar and the trenches were originally affiliated with the Southwest Army. It is not difficult for the troops to change to the highest commander, and the staff can not be replaced so well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The lieutenant colonel rummaged through the desk drawer and pulled out a piece of paper from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman nodded. "Yes, tomorrow will be fine. But can you let me think about it? If you want to go to the Central Army..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her friendly smile Up: "Do you still want to go to General Lopez? To be honest, I personally do not recommend you to choose this. It is good for you to go to a few different units. If you have been staying with you personally. The commander there, others will think that you are an incompetent guy who climbs up only by nepotism. To be honest, you did a good job before; you need to prove this to other sirs."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the door is still hesitating, he continues: "To be honest, the Central Army is a good place for officers with great ambitions - especially the magical officers. Although Marshal Fox is an old-fashioned officer. But he doesn't trust the magic like Betsy. General Betsy would rather bring a hundred anti-magic scrolls, and wouldn't use any new magic items that have a certain probability of failure. He trusted the white blade charge and the gun. And General Lopez’s personal ability is again Too strong, he will cover up the glory of his men. Be a staff member here, you have many opportunities to get ahead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full of Lieutenant Colonel. If you get ahead of the crowd... this person must have done it. As a "real" lieutenant colonel, he can become a general at any time - as long as a division commander dies. Or, if appropriate, he may even be promoted to a temporary army commander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, the Central Army sounds good too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hull rummaging through the file folder. The folder he took out this time was dark gray, and the cover was covered with a bold red "top secret" stamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You used to work in the logistics department of the rebels? Also served as an assault company commander? A very good resume."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Do I still have to work in the logistics department? Assign Firebirds?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is estimated that there will be nothing in a year. Firebird. To be honest, logistics is a good location, safe, although it is not easy to make meritorious deeds. You can't serve as a company commander, but you can have any one of the company's squad mages." Hull's quill smashed the ink twice, at the appointment The book is stalking, "The fifth national division, the haberd division. The chief of the logistics department, the first assault even the archaeologist, the alternate member of the Central Military Staff - so you are satisfied, lieutenant?" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen thought for a moment and replied: "No problem, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations. Tomorrow I reported at 8:00 in the morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left the military building, and he walked with joy in the direction of his home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the welfare home that night, he and all his relatives ate late into the night. The wine is not very good, but it is enough to make people indulge in the faint and beautiful world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he has no time to think carefully about the new position he has received. It sounds like this position is very good, the danger is small, the merits can be made, and the future is good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the headache was reported the next morning, Naimen understood why Hull had to work hard to sell him last night. He began to regret why he did not hear the assigned troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where he took office is not a formal freelancer at all. It was a national guard--a mean media called the force "a miscellaneous force" or a "military division." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officers are almost all third-rate officers who have been eliminated by their own divisions. Soldiers are supposed to be volunteers recruited by Lopez in Lenny and surrounding areas, but in fact one-quarter of them seem to be weak and languid, and another quarter looks like a hooligan or a cockroach. According to the "training" situation, about a quarter of the soldiers are only on the payroll. He forced himself to ignore the "soldiers" who were on the ground with their pipes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door suddenly understood why the soldiers who were also recruited in Lenny were divided into two divisions. Obviously, Clade picked up those really good volunteers and left the soldiers who were not good, but not motivated, and who were neither good nor volunteer, to guard Lenny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, he is going to take office in this army, provide them with logistics, and lead -- no, this time is followed -- from these people The "outsiders" that were picked out were built to make contributions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that I shouldn't drink so much wine when I was just 18 years old..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking like this, he pushed the door of the logistics office. There are only two desks inside, and one is empty. This is worse than his informal preparation office in Fort Vatican: there are five or six people there to clean up the logistics of the entire fortress, and it will not be so punctual. Then again, it is also a regular division. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was irritated to sit behind the desk and began to look at the organizational structure of the department and the General Staff, waiting for the arrival of his adjutant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her; The name of Lieutenant Colonel Tedwood is written in a prominent position. He also has a lieutenant general and two major generals. On his lower two floors. Many of the eunuch positions are empty - they seem to have never been served, including his adjutant position. Maybe he doesn't have to wait for someone who doesn't exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who came in did not comply with the military regulations: she did not Knocked on the door and did not get his permission. But when he heard this voice, he had no time to pursue these minor problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You... are you not a reserve officer? Are you not going to take care of business?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Oh, I have finished the matter. Anyway, I am just a small butler. I will not have a problem if the group is missing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still wearing The blonde and female lieutenant of the bright red Intre Army uniform came in. She dragged in with a big box and a women's bag and threw everything on the table opposite him. Her magical - perhaps really magic - quickly smashed out a variety of gadgets that had never been seen before, and almost filled the table in a flash. After doing everything, she found out the thin piece of paper and took it on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Intresats lesser Anne; Seifer was seconded to the Logistics Department of the Fifth National Division as a logistics adjutant based on this appointment. She is here to you. Reporting, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was holding his head in both hands, kneeling on the table, staring at the appointment book. He didn't know how long it took Anne to make this decision and how much it cost, but he knew that his unfortunate military career was just beginning. He does not deny that Anne is a very capable person, but sometimes the girl's nerves are as thick as the central column of the early Koman architecture. Her army that was ruined in this military discipline... he was a little afraid to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do they want to throw the sheep into the wolves? Or...the opposite?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He began to wonder if he chose the army as a direction of life is not a terrible mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a total of six people in the huge team who have escaped the "crash of the big detection network." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the active of the two knights, all of Jenica’s team escaped the frenzied magical fluctuations that caused paralysis, fainting, and ** damage; On the other side of the receiving force, there was only Itis; Captain Magnum escaped the magic effect. They took a full four coma, which seriously slowed the speed of the pedestrians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, the spare horse was left in advance, and the big bang escaped. I didn't expect the stone wall technique to cause such a terrible effect..." I muttered, thinking back to the disaster just now,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, it’s our chief’s fault. He just thought that he should find something to stop the terrible magic. "Is and Vlassall; Rasta and I chatted and talked back." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But why did the lieutenant know? Implosion is a magic that is rarely used, even the Magic University did not find this magic. The potential danger. If we know that this magic may cause the magic loop to collapse, we will not be so unpredictable..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, Shulan. Consider In the past, it didn’t help.” Rasta turned back and persuaded. “The key question now is how to get the understanding of the Julesian army without saving the Marshal Govar and causing huge casualties... right? Miss Shangyu?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well. If you go back like this... I think the military will be unstable and there may be mutiny. Not to mention, this situation, I Lieutenant Colonel Eugen also has a great responsibility." Itis has a heavy face. "But if you have to say it, there is no way to stabilize the military."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
