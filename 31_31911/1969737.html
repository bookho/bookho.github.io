			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warning: Because it is the history of the first parallel world, this setting is not necessarily accurate in the world of bis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Historical chronology warning dividers-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before fiducial(bf): pre-standard calendar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after fiducial(af): Standard calendar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bf About 500,000 years: Early Homo sapiens began to appear. It has been proved by evolution that it is the ancestor of all humanoids and the source of spiritual power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bf About 100,000 years: "Original spiritual power" began to appear in history. Unearthed evidence of the original totem worship and spiritual power in the ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The main phenomenon of this period is the remarkable improvement of primitive humans’ ability to hunt large creatures. Since there are not many tools found in archaeological excavations, It’s hard to explain the huge number of large biological corpses found in the remains of the caves: it seems that overnight, these snails struggling at the bottom, relying on berries, hunting small animals and finding natural dead creatures, have been killed. The power of the dead big beast... Of course, that is not the amazing light and electricity that we use in later generations, but just a little bit of 'supernatural' good luck..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;bf about 75,000 years to 60,000 years: the warm climate, "great differentiation" and "great evolution." Since the total amount of mental power has reached a certain level, there has been a “primitive god” (many theologians believe that these primitive pagan gods are only a combination of desires and beliefs). During the excavation of the period, many traces of alien creatures were found in the world; other types of creatures that mutated due to "mental power" were also discovered. Therefore, during this period, humanoid biology has become the major races we have seen today, and natural landscapes and creatures have also been heavily influenced by the source. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...When we explored the remains of the Gaynor in the province of Koman, we found a lot of traces of primitive religion. It can be said with great certainty that They must have a system of gods and totems like shamanism. In the caves of the Gaynor, there are a lot of wrecks that are difficult to describe and difficult to analyze by paleontologists; many alien biologists say they have nothing. Questions have the characteristics of invading creatures... although we are not sure whether these worships and prayers have been answered, and whether our ancestors can use them..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bf About 60,000 to 40,000 years: Early human life became extremely difficult due to the rapid deterioration of the environment and the entry of a large number of alien genes. In this, they learned to use tools and developed the earliest magic. In the later period of "great differentiation," the branches of early humans perished about nine tenths. For this reason, mental power declined during this period; but after that, as the survivor's mental ability improved, the total amount of mental power began to expand again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the spiritual power of this period has obviously developed. According to the ruins of the remains excavated in Changlin, some human tribes have mastered this period. The technique of obtaining concentrated and powerful mental power through 'meditation'. Magic is no longer a flash of light that happens by chance, nor is it the power of a small amount of overflowing beliefs through primitive prayers, but starts like a modern mage. Relying on meditation to concentrate on one's own strength, and then mobilizing the power of nature. Most of the basic techniques of magic that we are familiar with today may have appeared during this period..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;bf about 40,000-20,000 years: the last ice age. This is one of the reasons why many alien invaders have perished in this plane; but there are also many new cold aliens and magical creatures that have survived in the polar glaciers. During this period, several main branches of Homo sapiens - race (white, yellow, red, black), genie (golden white elf, grey elf, black elf), halfling (yellow dwarf, gray dwarf, The white dwarfs, the half-orcs (green, gray) expanded to all corners of the temperate Nanzhao, and almost killed all the docile large animals in the expansion. The original gods began to mature, and humans began to use early magic called "basic skills." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The first magic in the modern sense is still a lot of controversy today. There are many archaeologists who believe that the earliest magic should be Some basic magical elements of the energy class - such as 'lighting' or 'ignition'; and the psychomechanics are firmly opposed to them, thinking that the earliest magic should be the basic element of the protection or change class - 'moving things 'Or 'hysteresis'. Theologians have insisted that the earliest magic should be pure 'prayer'... This debate is still going on today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"...In the early days of the 16th century and the two great discoveries of the late 17th century, we rediscovered the surprising 'big cavity' in ancient legends. This discovery proves that ancient legends are not nonsense. A large cavity, located under the huge mountain range: we found countless lost species and civilizations in it. 'The big cavity is a natural miracle, and we will be able to build a splendid civilization in it'. Without a civilized war, this prophecy may indeed become a reality..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bf11000-8000: The germination of what we later called "civilization" began to appear. Some primitive tribes began to domesticate wild plants by relying on natural cultivation and a small amount of spiritual power - that is the first step in getting rid of hunter-gatherers. Later, the settled farmers (or some stimulating hunter-gatherers) began to domesticate the animals. This period lasted for about 3,000 years, and finally formed the "early civilization center" that we later called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bf8000-7000: The origins of civilization that can be traced back during this period include the plains of the middle reaches of the Confluence of the Great Plains and the Huayin: they should have had the original The power structure and religious structure, the priestly rule structure built around the spell users has obviously formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bf7000-6000: The germination of civilization has expanded to the Western Golden and White Elves (higher elves) at an alarming rate (compared to the madness calculated in the previous 10,000 years) Among the dwarves in the mountain range. After only about 40 generations, the entire continent has entered the tribal gods hierarchy and many farming tribes have emerged. In the same period, the domestication of pigs, sheep and other animals has also been completed - from among these tribes, the earliest herders were produced. But because the text has not yet been produced, the magical achievements of this period are difficult to determine: the non-stop battle between farming and hunting tribes, and later nomadic and farming tribes, it is easy to eliminate the sporadic modern magic sprout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bf6: The earliest hieroglyphic records appeared in the original civilization on the west side of the Ridge Mountains. This earliest hieroglyphic character developed into the West and became an alphabetic letter - the pronunciation of this text in the future was faithfully inherited by the ancient Elvish. When the text is eastward, it gradually cuts off the appearance of its pictogram and becomes the meaning of the square. Also in this period of entering the hands of civilization is the horse - this day will rule the entire battlefield, defeat all the horror of Warcraft, carrying the great creatures of the hope of the entire human civilization. Although there are many more creatures and World of Warcraft in the world than horses, only the horses can carry the entire human civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The linguistic examination of the Old Elvish and the Middle Eastern Standards proves that their original pronunciation is quite close. On the interpretation of the Great Eastern Plains by linguists This pattern was discovered in the hieroglyphics in the ruins of Tep. Some ancient Elvish and Oriental vocabulary words can even be replaced by pronunciations directly..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;"...In the era of no mental control and animal husbandry, people want to domesticate creatures, which must be carried out through complex natural genetic selection. Only a few large mammals can satisfy domestication conditions, and almost all of them remain. No. The large mammals that pass the test are only dogs, cows, horses, sheep, pigs, donkeys, and camels. Among them, horses are the most important. This kind of animal with strength, speed and endurance has completely changed the next. History: There are horses who defeat no horses, and the number of defeats is small... until the modern generation is replaced by steam and internal combustion power, Ma has disappeared from the historical stage..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&& Nbsp;&nbsp;bf5000-4000: The era of bronzes, wheels and magical rituals. After the text appeared, people finally found a way to convey the use of magic: it was called a "spell." The invention of bronzes also promoted the study of early psychodynamics: the earliest magical items were also created in this era. With the popularity of horses, chariots have also entered the field of vision. At the end of the 17th century, after the redevelopment of the Great Wilderness, people discovered the fascinating ancient civilizations of this era in the lower reaches of the marginal river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...When we rediscovered the prehistoric Far East Cognac Valley, we discovered the glorious civilization that was here in the past. The huge underground and underground shrines! That amazing Irrigation channels and furrows! The statues of gorgeous and full of sensual lines! There are also slate carving the earliest magic spells with cuneiform texts! These all civilizations fully prove the absurdity and limitations of 'the superiority of the elf civilization'. Far from the elves Before leaving their trees, the Tepu people on the edge of the mountain range have already completed an amazing and brilliant civilization! It is a history that has passed away..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;( The passage was completed in the 18th century, the period when Koman’s narrow nationalism flourished. The Komans eagerly pursued the ancient history of mankind, and they made the Tep people the ancestors of the Komans; in fact, due to the “big invasion” "The existence of the period, the characteristics of the Tepu people have been difficult to determine.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the East, this period is the beginning of a large-scale civilization.Unlike the West, the invasion of the East ended relatively early, and a unified tribal alliance formed around bf3000 to resist more invasions by Western/Northern barbarians.This is the root of the country in the future. They have maintained a rigid centralized system of secular empire and sacred empire for a long time, which gave them a strong political structure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bf2000-1000: Glorious city-states were born in the West, the wisdom of the classical era began to shine, and the civilization centered on the trade nationals Sveren was established on the shores of the mainland.In the far east, it enters under the rule of a huge unified dynasty with ethics as the connection.Numerous city-states built on the basis of iron, farming and civilization, scattered from the shores of the land of the heart to the river of Metebisi, from the forest of the elves to the vast areas of the mountain rangeIn the prosperous South, in this era, it is still only the primeval forest occupied by the green species (orcs).In this era, philosophy and magic are prosperous, and countless scholars have proposed countless hypotheses from the "water and fire elements" to the "light and dark duality".Various real and fake magic books compiled with the Sferren alphabet, as well as various idols/religious worships that fill the continent<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bf1000-bf500: In the early stages of this millennium, the civilization of the Sveren began to decline, and the land-based Hanni people began to rise.They did not completely eliminate the predecessor civilization, but faithfully inherited the discovery of the Sveren people - later generation historians called this the Sferren-Canni civilizationThe wise men, philosophers, and magicians who emerged from the Cannes completed the greater performance of the BisferenThey already know that "character" is just a representation of the source, and can use various methods to shorten, change or ignore.They also know that through continuous basic exercises, people can improve the effect of driving mental energy.The Cannes divide the magic effect from low to high into five levels (equivalent to today's zero to four segments, but the composition is quite different), establishing a university and magic society among the various city-states, performing various alchemy, Discussion and debate on metaphysics, philosophy, and original scienceThis is the first golden period of magic. About 50% of the below-mentioned arcane used by us today is about 50% created during this period.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves developed great magic when the Cannes expanded the range of arcane magic.There is no doubt that healing magic is an epoch-making invention that is eligible to be included in ten or even five inventions that change history.As a modern person who is used to treating magic, it is hard to imagine the shock that this magic gave to people: what kind of miracle it is! That is far more impressive than the little tricks the priests played.When a priest heals a wound in front of you - even a small wound - it is hard not to convert to this religion.The power of this religion is surprisingly powerful: it successfully unifies the chaotic and hostile forest elves and terrestrial elves, and finally establishes a unified national identity that will be called the “high elves” in the future.Even the nearby human tribes were conquered by the power of this religion.When the Canni people's civilization is divided into kingdoms, empires, and city states because of the understanding of magic and mutual blockade, the civilization of the elves is unified under the protection of the same religion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bf500-250: The philosophical conflict between arcane and magic has finally occurred inevitablyPhilosophers and theologians travel across the continent, the nature of the debater, wisdom, and the worldReligion is springing up and rooting, and devout believers begin to spread all over the earth.During this period, God - finally appeared on the historical stageWhen people believe that God is a person, God will have personality.A large number of true or false gods, prophets, voters, and popes appear everywhere, and magic gradually begins to penetrate the hearts of the people.At the same time, it has also been invested in war, adventure, and conspiracy.Around bf277, the emperor's Dharma, blessed by the Dagong Church; Tiotstein succeeded in controlling all the elves in the Western Forest through peace and force, unified them into the "Sacred Kingdom" and began his conquest of greatness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bf250-100: If there are any advantages to the elves, it is their life.King Dillamon can patiently wait for a strong opponent to die, or wait until they are stupidThe average life span of the elves is about three hundred years. For the conquerors, this life is very good.During the long life of Diormond; in his long life, he gradually conquered most of the human city-states and kingdoms on the shores of the mainland, killing their kings and transporting their wise men to the capital of Hongrinasti.The academics of the elves began to leap forward, and the arcane and philosophy have taken a new step.The priests of other human religions also received such courtesy, and the priests with unique skills began to preach throughout the Kingdom of the Saskatchewan - eventually, most of them were subtly accepted by the orthodox church.The glorious civilization of the Kingdom of St. Mori has great appeal, and gradually makes those small states unable to do so.Soon, the Elven Kingdom has the entire West Coast, beginning with the human power of the East – the Canny Empire with a long history is across the sea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bf100-0: This century is the century in which elves compete with humans for hegemonyDuring the hegemony of the Canny Empire and the Sassen Kingdom, the entire continent was caught in a period of constant war.King Dillamon was killed in battle with the Canni Army, his son Kuras; Tioldstein inherited the throne, still repeatedly defeated by CannedyRegrettably, although there are hundreds of battles on the battlefield, the Cannes still cannot achieve even a little advantage in culture.Compared with the tolerance of the elf empire and the advanced civilization, the Canni people gradually feel powerless.In the end, after their greatest masters died, Kuras; Tioldstein broke their defense and razed the glorious city of Canny (the city that was later called "Canny Fort"), which was later New city rebuilt there)That is about bf15 years or soNext, the elf disarmed all the alliances and hostile countries with lightning speed. The force extended to the mountain range, and the dwarves and orcs also praised them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
