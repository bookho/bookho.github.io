This is the sixth day of the Jena Blenheim double battle. The battle in the Blenheim area has been going on for a whole week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Lenny Battle is a fierce and vocal movie, the Jena Battle is part of the opera, then Blenheim is a battle. TV series, most of the time is flat, but the number of key sets is **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From August 4th, the Fegota public launched a wave-like offensive against the Freedom Army on the South Bank. The Elf reinforcements have also successfully reached the right wing of the Emperor's right wing the day before yesterday, covering the entire battlefield on the side, extending the strength of the entire battlefield to two to one. Fortunately, the Elf Army is pretending to be fighting hard, the entire front still relies on the Fergota army to launch an attack, and then again and again by the Major General and him. The army was defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Metz River, which is not too wide, looks like an insurmountable Scorpio, the Fegota between Russell and Russell. The bodies are more than two thousand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Until the morning of August 9. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the sunrise of the day, the Freedom Service was surprised to find that it was originally the position of the Elf Army, and the silver armor was shining. Tower people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This transfer is a secret transfer. The Marquis of Cavendish? von Fegota led the army into the Elf camp at two in the morning. He secretly mobilized eight battalions and crossed the river in the form of a column from the position of the Sansen Army. The weak left wing, the elves followed behind them to consolidate the results. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Command’s command was so flustered for a second migration to leave the Sansen artillery bombardment, but this was only the beginning of a nightmare. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Bruto put all the reserve teams into the left wing and reorganized the line of defense, the right-wing Bluscher began under the cover of the maid artillery. Cross the river. It’s also a staunch attack – just as they know that the Free Army has almost no spare reserves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the right wing was broken, the defense retreated to the town of Blenheim, and the Freedom Command was forced to move for the third time. They gave up the Metz River defense line and almost the entire Blenheim, and then retreated to the village of Grau on the banks of the Metebysi River. On the line of defense, the artillery positions outside Blenheim are almost their last reliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than nine battalions of infantry are defending Blenheim, resisting the Bruchelle's attack again and again, and the other seven battalions are on the left. The shelling of the Elf-Cavendi Xu coalition. The Liberal Army’s logistics staff have begun to burn the goods that may not be transferred in the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such a difficult situation, the afternoon combat meeting was held, but the unresting air was surging at the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third post-migration headquarters is located in a hillside church outside the village of Grau. This church belongs to Park Xiu, one of the four major schools of Protestantism. Yes, the responsible pastor has long since fled, leaving only a large unguarded cemetery. When every battalion horseman rushed back from his camp, he felt an unspeakable repression next to the cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of attendees at the staff meeting was nearly half that of the number of people who should be present, and the presence of a large number of front-line troops and the collapsed battalion officers were not natural. I don't know why, even Major General Bruto Luther himself has not appeared. The staff members who have returned from the front line have begun to be unable to stand up and begin to exchange the battles on their respective fronts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not all the reserve teams are pressed to the left wing. I am afraid that we will be completely stunned by the assault." Another captain of the captain sighed. "But this leads to a serious shortage of right-wing troops. You have heard the name of the Marshal." Oriental Fable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which fable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second Kengal battle When I spoke, the story of the Eastern King and the Minister of Horse Racing. The Minister used his superior horse to win the victory against the King’s medium horse and the medium horse against the King’s inferior horse. It seems that he is practicing this strategy now. "We are waiting for the horse now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has been five minutes late." Finally, a famous camp staff could not hold back and fight against a headquarters. The staff asked, "Why didn't you return to the Major General?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lord General went to the front of Blenheim forty minutes and personally directed the battle there. A supervised bishop’s help to the battle is great. When I left, he seemed to be still The front line is with the commanders of the five battalions in the inner city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another staff member who came back from the right wing explained: "To fight against Bruchelle That madman, our strength is far from enough. We are almost lost in Blenheim, and the enemy prepares the full battalion to rush into the town one after another. We can only barely keep the offensive on the periphery. The artillery does not play against it. The upper hand, the female artillery played too accurately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is only one problem in my statement." The speaker is a battalion commander on the left wing," How many reserve teams do we have? The cavalry squadrons have been very difficult to cover the battlefield. The infantry is suppressed by the other side in the left and right wings. This fight can only be defeated across the line! Where is our reinforcement? Since Jena has Winning, when will the reinforcements come over?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the theme of this staff meeting is that there is no further reinforcement." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heard this gloomy Sound, like a spring, like all staff bounced up from his chair, facing the door salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marshal Lopez left his reserve team in Jena. Jena won, which also means we don't have enough troops. So, now Let's hold the Blenheim detachment combat meeting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their commander walked in from outside the door and pressed his star on the table, three A tired officer followed him. There was silence throughout the church and only the voice of the Major General was heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I swear by the honor of the Freedom Major General Bruto Luther, everything I say next is what I think is true. If it is I can’t confirm or don’t know what I’m going to say.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80% of officers and 100% of non-commissioned officers did not hear their commanders The routine oath, because they only noticed the change in his appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pluto? Luther’s Major General’s uniform has been completely soaked in blood, and the enemy’s blood has dribbled down from his cuffs, and it looks like Like a murderer who just finished working. That is not like Chen’s identity as a bishop or former senator, and it is in stark contrast to his usual elegance and gentleness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than one person is thinking: Has the war situation deteriorated to such an extent? Although the Major General is almost the most powerful magic user of the whole army, it is not a good sign that a battle will hit the main body and the blood can be used for bathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the speeches were in full compliance with their expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone, we are now suffering from a full-scale attack by our superior enemy. The enemy already knows Jena’s fiasco. At the same time, they also know that we have no reserve team. I know that Lopez’s team is not in Blenheim. We have to put away all fantasies, and today is the final battle.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eloquence of former members of the Republic of the Congo is as always Good ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first phase of the morning defense, although temporarily successful, but the enemy has summoned their reserve team to invest in Blenheim, we have no soldiers I can invest in the right wing. Since I am going to the right wing to defend, there will be no free speech stage in today's combat conference. I will directly state what I know and give orders."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our troops will be divided into three parts. The heavy forces are nailed to the left, the right wing is dead on the south side of Blenheim, and the enemy is throwing more troops into the town. The central cavalry gradually releases the array from now on. From 40 squadrons to 15 squadrons, 25 squadrons withdrew and stood by behind Grau. The staff continued to retreat and was ready to abandon the headquarters."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All staff members have opened their mouths and feel that their chiefs are crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone shouted out loudly: "Strengthen the left and right wings, but withdraw the middle? Then prepare for the fourth transfer?! The sir, so you can't win!" I have never heard of the strategy of withdrawing the central government, nor have I ever heard the victory of voluntarily giving up the highlands and villages!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pluto? The screaming slammed the officer, and a bloody handprint was shot on the military map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, no, we don't have time. Because one of the most important things will happen in twenty minutes. All the magic in the region will be invalid. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general will speak in an understatement, but the careful person can hear the urgency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Most of you should have seen the Jena’s report. After twenty minutes, the situation will be more than the 'magic muddy' phenomenon that takes place south of Jena. Seriously. You immediately rushed back to your respective battalion team. From now on, you will save all the use of magical items and leave it to use in 20 minutes. If the enemy is in chaos, immediately break it. The meeting is over."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, how do you know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God." The Superintendent of the Innovative Society answered this question, and no one immediately Ask a word more. The entire Free Army, and even the entire South, could not find a few theologians who could be compared with the Major Generals in front, and questioned that he was purely redundant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the Major General sat down in his chair, crossed his hands and began to pray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officers bowed their heads and used their shadows to cover their faces. They went out in a complicated way and went back to command their respective units. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can hear the content of their commander’s prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content is like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister, you think too much about miracles! You can build the bottom layer through the Arcane, yes, this upper layer of response and communication agreement, no I still have to rely on the theory of magic to build, or the whole magic net is just a bunch of magical flows that are connected to each other! Besides, sooner or later, sooner or later, don’t choose now! I even have Brianim defense fast. Can't keep it! This is chaos! And this is not a general mess. This is a complete mess!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not a scruples With his magic and the remaining staff, Bonnie Seifer almost wanted to open his hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miracle. The divine magic that she has worked hard for many times, but can never be completed, is the same as the complete resurrection and is listed at the top of the sacred theory. Only the most devout or priest who has contributed the most to religious theory can occasionally summon this great miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wish and miracle feel very similar, they all make a request, and then realize it through the magical power of magic. However, the means of achieving the two are different. The wishing technique is like a power of attorney submitted, and the means of its implementation must be reasonable, but you may need to spend some time to understand whether the way you wish to make a mistake, and to understand why it chooses such a means. The miracle technique is more like a magic box that can change the rabbit. It directly realizes the result to you. How do you think about it? The result is realized by what means. Most of the methods are difficult to reconstruct with rationality - or It is said that the level of magic science at this stage cannot be reconstructed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the latter is much more dangerous than the former. Who knows how these black boxes of the gods will understand the miracles you pray for? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The miracle will become a sacred condemnation if it is wrong," and the history of the church is full of such examples. Bonnie knew that the original version of this sentence was "the mission will become a heresy if it is a word." The effect of miracle can be more complicated and more powerful than wishing, but the relative reaction is more direct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
