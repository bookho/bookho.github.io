Soleton can still see everything, from the empty shelves in the room to the desktop where the huge magical array was once painted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiting time has been too long, his eyes have completely adapted to this darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched out his limbs, lying on the cold ground, looking up at the holes in the ceiling. Some holes are made with attacking magic, while others are vents made with plastic magic, and the shimmer is revealed from the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He realized that time has passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long has it been? he does not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past period of time is as long as two and a half centuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residual heat on the military uniform she left has already been exhausted, leaving only a slight body fragrance, but it will soon dissipate. Just like the crystal blue sand around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's just the embers that keep the body magic," Nana said to himself, "just the embers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his hands uncontrollably swept all the crystal sand on the ground together, gathered into a small sand pile, and guarded by his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this darkness, he seems to be able to hear her voice and see her smile. Annie has been smiling with such confidence. Now, in retrospect, the smile shines like the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is subconsciously lifting the memory of the hand to the front. The cut surface of the sapphire feels cold and cold, protecting her memory. Through the blue cross section, he looked at a silent world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Memory, soul and body. In the absence of the soul, does memory have consciousness? Should not, hearing, and five senses are all connected to the body. Then what I said, you should not hear it in the future, Anne."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said to her memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Actually... I already knew that you loved me. I already guessed it, hateful."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of his curse is himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I always knew, right? You are a jerk who has licked the dog's eyes, and is resistant to the door? Solerton!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne Sefere loves the door? Soledon, who loves the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than she loves anyone. More than anyone loves him. The feeling of being loved is so heavy, and the body that is pressed against the door is shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I really deserve this kind of love? But am I really a person who can deserve her?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't know. He can't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, do I really love her...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of it, the door The whole body is shaking. He really doesn't know if he loves her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...is really a jerk. Can you trust the memory to a jerk so safely? Where does this belief come from?" I can't shine like you, Annie! Even if you say..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if you say that... even if you say that..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is repeated again. She really said that -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you really think that I am your hero, Anne Seifer? You really think that this memory Is it a wise decision to entrust me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some liquid in the eyelids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a tear, he said to himself, he promised her, won’t cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the door faintly saw the memory of the hand lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Subconsciously query, feedback method to choose the user's favorite voice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a white light Just like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick query results: Yes. Further queries require confirmation. You can choose the method of confirmation, whether through language, text or awareness. Please confirm again if you need to confirm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is blind, like a deep dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden white light is too dazzling, he can't see anything, only nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter how others think about you, you are my hero. You will be my hero, always. Always."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he heard this voice again. How many times has this been? Time and time again, her voice, her smile, her, her, what she saw and heard were her...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to know It’s really this passage, do you want to repeat it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was shocked and wondered if only this voice could be heard. Isn't that going to be here for too long to create an illusion? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Annie Sefer's Memory Excerpt', encrypted content, certified. You have chosen to use her by default because you have permission to do so. Sound as an interactive interface. If you want to use parchment, prayer, conscious projection or other more efficient interactions, please confirm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his ear It is a cold female voice. Its tone sounds almost the same as Anne Sefir, but it's cold, I can't hear a trace of emotion, and of course there is no smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me, is this an illusion...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." That cold ice The female voice, which sounds very similar to Anne’s voice, immediately replied, “The magic net has been activated, and the authorized user of the first source node, all the identity certificates of the door-to-door Soledon have passed.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is so hard to lick yourself. It is not a dream, nor an illusion. There is indeed a voice in his ear. The grammar is complex, full of nasty long sentences and clauses that don't sound like the language used by humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to your understanding of the magic network and the advanced permissions you have, you can skip the authentication step and use the thinking query directly. The magic net expression is According to the permissions and knowledge you have. Orientals will hear his language, and old scholars will see parchment. Even if you are a devout illiterate, the magic net will be displayed in the form of a god. It will never It is expressed in a way that the user can't understand. "Probably I felt the idea of ​​being resistant to the door. "The cold ice version of Anne" also lowered the sound with interest. "If you don't like this sound, you can change the expression."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...it's good." Too much information made Nana's reaction too late. "If I don't understand it, the magic net has a near-infinite expression?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. It is a combination of reason and belief, limited only by the knowledge and imagination shared by all members. MagicNet expands everyone's ability and Build yourself in these added values. If you want to investigate further ? The principle, there are about 7100 relevant results, need a voice in the form of about 60,000 minutes, which is expressed in more than 40 days time, we must continue to do "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;The Voice of the Magic Network immediately replied: "The knowledge of the whole world. There are currently 77.34 million detailed information, which is still increasing with the expansion of the network-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resist the door and waved his hand: "You don't need to query. Also, it's not a query that I specifically explained, and I don't need to query it. I already know that this is really a miracle... the miracle is uncompromising. She succeeded. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie is not bragging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She really has the desire and miracle to change the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She really gives everyone magic, it will definitely bring a new era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But... for her, I am also her hero."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he was a child, he thought he was different. He has flexible fingers and a firm belief that he can be a good thief, and of course he can be a good magician, one day to use his own power to change the whole world, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he knows that he is no different from others. Everyone must grow up, buy citizenship, marry a wife, and that's all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he knew that everyone was different from everyone else, but not as different as he thought. Some people will die in a stray bullet, some will not; some have courage, some do not. They also have different dreams, but in the end, they are not much different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But she said that I am her hero."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a choice. Some people decide what they want to achieve, they go to action, and the world changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is really no different from others now-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I can work hard A career that is different from others. Some prophecies are self-fulfilling, just like wishing, right, Anne?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the magic net suddenly asks again Road: "Is this a query behavior?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is laughing. Maybe it's like the smile that Annie has been hanging on her face, maybe not, he doesn't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not because I know the answer. Because she said, I am her hero, so I know. This prophecy will be self-fulfilling." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never thought that there would be someone who really thought he was a hero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should probably go to the empire...but I won't go. I won't give up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world, one person really thinks that you are her hero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if there is only one person, "it is enough." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a trivial person, only a trivial dream. All my things are not earned by myself, but by luck and the gift of the gods. Everything I want to work hard to achieve, all failed, no success."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is his past experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, in this world, there is another person who thinks that I am not a small person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Even if you search the whole world, you may not be able to find a person, calling you a hero of him or her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will be your hero, Anne. I will be the hero you imagine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Sometimes, as long as a title can change a person's world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, as long as you change a person's world, it will change the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because faith determines power, it has always been. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faith determines power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s always the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, a group of sheep led by a lion can not beat a group of lions led by a sheep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a person with a firm belief that goes forward for his goal is always better than a hundred people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although this sentence is a bit late. Although you can't hear this sentence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; With or without magic, the world is driven by those who are firmly committed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They and they know what they are going to do, they and they know why they are doing it, they and they know how to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know the answer now - I really love you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the door Uncontrolled wetting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I love you, Anne. Although I can't guarantee it now, but one day, it will be more than anyone I love. One day, I will It will be more than anyone who loves you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kept repeating the words, although he knew that no one could hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not dead. No, it’s not dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered that Promise, raise your hand and try to dry your eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I promised. I clearly promised. This is not a tear, I didn't cry because I promised."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, how to wipe the tears can not wipe. The eyelids felt a slight pain, as if there were countless gravel rubbing inside. He knew that it was the crystal sand that her body had formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I found what I should do. Because she said, I am her hero."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this time he did not have to work hard to pile up those crystal sands together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the reality does not match the ideal, I will change the reality. I swear, I will be worthy of the name of Anne Sefir, the most powerful mage of the world." Hero."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door stood up and clenched. The nails licked into the meat, but he didn't realize it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will defend your wishes until the end of this life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leiden looked up and looked at the ceiling she had stared at, and the sky outside the ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if that hope is necessarily bloody."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is gone, and the past He is not there anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe the country I want to build, and finally I am destined to decay, to devour everything. But I will do it too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up and put on the red one-sleeved uniform. The size of the military uniform is only a slightly larger vest for his size. He re-visited his two trophies. He picked up the "power" and inserted it in his armed belt, and carried "kindness" on his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, wait for me, Anne. I will fulfill all your wishes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He secretly hid Anne's memory card in the heart of the vest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the proof of her memory, and also the center of the magic net, the first source node. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Absolutely won't lose. Because I am the hero of Anne Sefir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The door turned and turned to look at the empty hall. The fire door has closed it forever. He saluted the empty room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major looked up and looked at the big hole that had just been hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the delivery anchors should have been closed, he thought. In order to achieve his goal, what he needs is...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need to query the following magics and confirm the possibility of using them. The first one is - ―”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nelity said several requests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the Magic Network responded to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;August 9th, 1666 At 6 o'clock in the afternoon, the great zero (thezerohour)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three districts of the Mentby West River in the district of Lenni South<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a black smoke column everywhere in the city of Lennie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to report the position of the emperor’s entry, the Free Army had to ignite the roadside houses to create a smoke-transmitting military. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because all the magic has been invalidated, it is easier for Emperor to enter Lenni for the second time than expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the two sides of the reconnaissance cavalry caused some casualties, the main force almost did not shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retreat to half of the Freedom Army was caught off guard, and they decided to shrink the remaining troops to the port area in case they were broken by the emperor. The emperor immediately concentrated on them, and the company from different regions filled every street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the blade-like sunset, the last major force of the empire was arranged in a strict array on the not-so-wide dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last officer of the array on the right wing of the army has almost stepped out of the dam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the attack has not yet begun. The array of heavy blacks and greys just stopped there, waiting quietly for the attacking horn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the wounded and defeated soldiers passed through the gap between their arrays and were reorganized behind the supervision of the officers, which was the failure of the first attack. People who have escaped their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because there was no resistance in front, the Pioneer troops rashly broke through and the result was defeated by a strong block. It was a story that was completely new." < br br br 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛 玛? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the mouth is talking, the soul of the green hair has always been hooked on the shoulders of the host, for fear of being swept away by the great changes in the magical world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is also normal. Anyway, with the current strength of the two sides, the South Army can not win a few games. Their residual strength on the North Shore has been less than 10,000. People, right? The Eastern War art named this situation 'half-crossing', which is one of the worst situations - not to mention that they can't use magic now."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of her parasitic looks to the northeast, talking to herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl with short brown hair is not an ordinary noble lady. She is no stranger to the battlefield and even commanded an army of thousands of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This girl does not know the results of Blenheim, nor does she know that she has become the next lord of the Pyganta Principal:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denica? Weilun? von Fegota Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A name that sounds full of appeal in all senses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we don't know if it's true." Maggie insisted, "Don't forget that this situation is caused by the Free Army, maybe they Just to lure the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Without the sound reinforcement, who can dare to launch an offensive? In the face of a solid support, no magic support is just a death. As long as a little more complicated protection and support magic can not be used as expected."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ninja turned his eyes to Newton, who was also working and recording with a large group of magicians, and shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking, are you now in this spirit state unaffected, Maggie?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It cannot be said that it is completely unaffected. Now, the Secretary of the Security Minister may be mad, he should be able to discover the dummy I have left over there. Have you learned the basics of the undead school?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Yanika shook her head. "Most of the books in this school are only accessible to senior members of the association."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soul, **, memory, any two can constitute a stable state, if there is only a single element, it needs a huge magic to maintain, or will become a completely undead. I am now the reason It can be stabilized because it is borrowed from your ** and nerves; the only thing that is lost on Sid-Nasser's side is the memory and the counterfeit soul. Now it must have been exposed because of the chaos of the magic structure." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost female magician appears to be a lot more than the past, which exposes her End of anxiety. Since the collapse of the Elf Empire, there has never been a huge event that has changed the laws of all magic. No one knows what the enemy is doing and what the consequences will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, until now, you didn't feel anything abnormal, Maggie ya? Still only I can see you, you just lost in front of others In other words, the current magical state does not affect the origin of any magic, but only affects the way magic affects other things, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Jenica looked around and confirmed that no one was staring at herself, reaching out and pinching the face of Maggie. In the eyes of others, she just rubbed her fingers in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it's just involved in your own actions, it's exactly the same as before. You borrowed my ** to build existence, so only I can communicate with you. Yes, what is the difference between the current structure and the first structural change?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green-haired witch licked her hair and broke free: "Only a single subject Simple magic and most of the magic have returned to normal work, but most of the complex magic can't work. I can maintain existence, but can't show up like before. There must be logic in the middle, but we haven't found it yet... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before solving this problem, we are absolutely afraid to attack. If the enemy magic can work normally, we are going to die. It is too stuffy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡? Wei Lun stood up and repeated it to his guard with a slightly louder voice: "It's too stuffy, I go." The front of the position is breathable. Inform the Minister of Temporary Magic Affairs Sir Newton."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She deliberately bit the word "temporary". The Guardsman suddenly stumbled and did not stop her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior walked a few steps along the path he was familiar with, and soon found a two-story building that did not have a fire or owner, and dexterously turned in. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the roof here, you should be able to see the whole port...ha, sure enough. The Free Army is not much left, their ship is empire The artillery forced to retreat to the outskirts of the port area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggie slaps on the shoulders of 黛尼卡, floats up again, squints and observes The formation of the Free Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The distance is anchored by the magic gun range...do they also know that the empire’s remote magic cannon has failed? The magician responsible for launching is not working properly. Start it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not good news. So the Free Army can't retreat, the two armies must have a battle. Considering the current state of magic, really Winning and losing is hard..." Yanika shook her head. "You are a professional politician, Maggie. What do you think will happen if the Empire loses here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Missy, you have to escape. This is not the last army of the empire, but it is the last one with offensive capabilities. Lost the 30,000 people, the emperor absolutely It is impossible to escape to the north."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The result is almost the same. Nearly 20,000 people here are the last and organized backbone of the Free Army. They will first withdraw from the river. I am afraid that this number will not be exceeded. The 100,000 people who have been defeated by Lenny have already played. Broke the backbone of the entire Freedom Army. If you lose 20,000 yuan, I am afraid that the Free Army has not been able to retake Lonnie in three years. The Western General Army in the north is also categorically incapable of this ability."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 thought for a moment: "What you mean is that this is a decisive battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. There will be Peace." Maggie suddenly spit out a new word, "Sweet peace. The illegitimate child that can be produced by the most brutal war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maggie, you I really like to say good words in an uncomfortable way.” Renee laughed. “If those pacifists hear you describe their favorite peace, they will die.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am only stating the facts. War can only be ended in two situations: When the party has lost everything, or when both sides have no power to fight, the real peace is very expensive. You should also start thinking about what to do after the arrival of peace, 黛妮卡维伦.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s still too early to escape or play the court game. Anyway, I don’t need the credit here, let them go.” I was lazy. "From the day before yesterday, I have not slept even a good feeling. If Newton can't make a secret of magic tonight, there will be no change on the battlefield. This is definitely the final battle." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice suddenly stopped, her eyes fixed in the direction of the setting sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"--It will break out tomorrow..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sharp whistle broke through Skyline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone looked up and saw only a deep red curve cloud rushing to the left in the sky, drawing an orange in the sunset Cloud map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they have an understanding of the future of magical science, they will know that it is the end of the condensation that occurs when high-efficiency hydrocarbon fuels are burned, or "flying" cloud". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the trail, Naimen Soledon shivered in the height of minus 30 degrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good... so fast! What is the magic of this speed? This magic called a manned magic missile is really a 'prominent, destructive Is it enough, can you travel fast's spells?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the magic net that sounds like Annie is explained in real time: "This magic is magic." The follow-up magic of the missile uses a huge technique. The common wizard can use it to escape from the pursuit of high-speed flying machinery. There are 19 detailed results. Do you need to continue?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need! Ah... Auntie! No, I, I want to query control magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding with the magic of a temporary query A one-time high-speed aircraft, the door to know what is called asking for trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temporary search for magic is always very dangerous - it tells you what is the knowledge you need, but it doesn't tell you how to use them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the query. The control method is very simple. You just need to use the third positioning magic that you queried before, aim and then squat down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh... forget it, anyway, I will be frozen to death. Set, position... the center of the emperor array! Dive!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flying cloud turns a big "v" in the air and goes straight down the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tail to seize the gripper of the giant magic missile, and recite the spell of the feathers with the fastest speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But others can't see his jealousy and panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of all bystanders, the entire flying cloud behind him reflects the red glow of the glow in the setting sun, which looks like a straight thorn to the emperor* * Central volley spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Protection magic can't work! The troops are flashing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Protect yourself first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The strongest empire guards are also in a mess in the face of unknown threats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter who is coming, or what, one thing that can be confirmed is that it is free to use magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still very advanced, new magic that no one has ever seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every empire knows that they have a strength advantage, but they also know that they do not have the advantage of magic suppression now. Enemies can refactor the magic rules of the entire world, and they can take advantage of it at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Gustav Hugh? The Emperor Koman also knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no security minister's insistence, he has no ability to get here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it seems to be the end..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea floats young The emperor’s mind, no matter how to drive away, can’t drive away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, the missile slammed on the ground in front of him and exploded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, the blood of the royal family was launched, and Gustav wisely escaped a few pieces that should have hit him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he saw the part of the missile transported on the ground and the familiar face standing on top of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the smoke, stand a familiar enemy. Just one day ago, he still squatted in front of his eyes and survived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More crazy is his dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young free soldier was wearing two military uniforms, the lower layer was a complete blue Russell military uniform, and the upper level was a ragged single Sleeve red Italian military uniform, this military uniform is soaked in blood, looks like a bloody camouflage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two military uniforms are tied together by a pair of major epaulets, and the hem of the placket flutters in the evening wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the chest of each military uniform, there is a big and scary medal - Gustav knows that it is the highest medal of the Free Army. Medal of Excellence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young major’s mouth is smiling. There was a smile all the time, and this smile made him look a little crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More crazy is his equipment. In addition to the pair of chapters of excellence, he even took the symbol of the imperial emperor "power" and "benevolent" one of the Eight Holy Swords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is undoubtedly a show: it is he who defeated the last resistance of the Imperial Lenny Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, this person is standing on the commanding heights of the entire Imperial Camp, looking down at the entire emperor, and their emperor, without a trace on his face. Fear--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All but his face is full of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the roof not far away, 黛妮卡薇伦 opened his mouth and couldn’t believe the sight: “Soleton?! God. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, among the gaze of everyone, the Major of the Freedom Army slowly spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of the only loudspeakers in the entire battlefield, the sound of this small area can be transmitted to the entire Lenny. All others have no time to do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "I am here to end this war, Your Majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gus Taff did not consciously take a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he said this arrogant, the door of Soleton was still shaking slightly. He did not expect this magic to fall directly to the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door said to himself, even the emperor stepped back in front of me, calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can do it. Don't let them preemptive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raises his right hand A magical missile is accumulated on each knuckle. The voice of the magic net quietly told him that in addition to him, there is still someone who will have such magic, although he does not know who it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The clustered missile (massivemagicmissiles), prepared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsurprisingly, faithful The Guards shouted to prepare for defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door does not hesitate to slap the right hand, a dozen missiles flew out along the source of the sound, and the empire that lacks defensive magic immediately A scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please forgive me for preemptiveness. Is the Holy Empire a negotiating envoy for this kind of hospitality? Your Majesty?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door directly points to the name of Gustav. He was a little surprised to find that there was no high-level caster around the emperor. It is another opportunity that is good for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, a major, can represent the Free Army? I thought the Fox dictator would send a more important person."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gustav coughed twice, calmed his mind and tried to re-establish his dominant position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know who I am, the Emperor. If you don't know any of these officials, do you need to introduce them?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gustav opened his mouth and tried to squeeze out the word: "You are the chapter of excellence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I am the one who just used it for myself. I am the one who is incapable of judging the situation, only a little clever and adaptable. I am the fool who doesn’t know how many cards in his hand will dare to bet the winner.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you know, this is me, some people say that I am her hero, and the door is filled in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When we last met, you said that you are glad to have an enemy like me. I hope that you will still be glad that I am your enemy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door lifted the "power" and activated the ability on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large group of imperial nobles exclaimed: "That... that is... that is power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" "Feng? Fagota is a great soldier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door smiled and said: "And I am the new Lenny Army combat staff, 'Double Excellence Chapter', Naimen Major Solonton. End this war, kneel down. Let your troops retreat, I will also take my troops to retreat. There is no need to bleed more."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor was surprised to find that he seemed to cringe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t know how much power the enemy is in front of him, and he doesn’t know what will happen to his rejection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This emotion is... fear? He is afraid of this person, afraid of this enemy who is younger than him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough..." Gustav coughed twice and put on the most serious expression. "You mean, let's be here." Sign a peace agreement, let peace come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door raised his mouth and revealed an Annie-like smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This smile is a bit crazy on his face, but he knows that his ideas have never been as clear as they are now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until now, the Security Minister finally came to the late with the main casters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if Sid? Nasser, now he can only make some swear words, he also dare not directly attack: "Bold! We are now You can still kill you, and all your army, a small major! You only have one person!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen finds his acting skills more and more skilled It’s just like another personality emerges: “Do you think that I am alone here?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Anne is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is flashing through the thoughts in the heart, but fortunately the enemy should not be able to regain the magic of reading the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he has. As long as he moves a thought, the familiar but cold simulation sound will whisper in his ear the use of the magic he wants, the number of people and the magic consumption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should have regained some of your own defeats. Should you know our magical power? Sorry, there may not be a lot of defeats." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time even Sid's face has changed. The security minister apparently remembered the terrible high-end magician who reached out and pressed his finger on something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must have the ability to kill me. But we still have a lot of majors. You can certainly kill the 20,000 Free Army here, even Kill their commanders. But if necessary, we can choose a new dictator, such as the active Marshal of Jena, or the great Webster former member..."<br />< />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sid snorted and said: "I don't believe you have so many majors like you. Does every major of the Freedom Force have a double chapter of excellence?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know that we have a stronger magician than me." Nike shook his head. "And, I want to emphasize that you only have one emperor, no Recognized as the heir of the heir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment of hearing this sentence, almost all court mages and pastors have changed their looks. They are trying to protect the emperor, and the door suddenly raised the "power", referring to the emperor, and shouting:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, Gustav! Ancient Stav? Hugh Coleman!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He called the name of the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me your decision! Do you want to fight to the end, or is it peaceful?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; At that moment, Gustav Hugh Coman was relieved for the first time in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He regretted not killing this enemy in the central square of Lenny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this remorse, he took a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 2. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, let us be peaceful. I represent the sacred Coman Empire machine ally, in the name of the empire orthodox ruler, in the name of the covenant gods, we two From this moment, the army will stop all hostilities. If this oath is violated, the punishment of the gods will come to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shoulder of the emperor sank for the first time . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he took Lenny and won his long-cherished wish for centuries, he was not happy at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen thought and replied: "On behalf of the Republic of the Union, I agree to this oral agreement in the name of its orthodox ruler. In the name of the gods of the covenant, all punishments will come to us equally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this evening, the "1666 Lennon compromise agreement" was produced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire will control all the land to the north of the Metebexi River and west of the King River, and has two-thirds of the Great Plains of the Ruhr, almost all of the elite areas. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This compromise is only a confirmation of the situation, and both sides have lost further attack capabilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main forces of the Lenni Army and the Western Army have been broken, and the Emperor will default the remaining Freedom Army to the King River and the Metterby River; The empire also needs time to build defenses in the new territories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have 80% confidence, he is bluffing." Yanika looked at the figure of Nani, and said in a complicated mood, "Soleton has always been a ...the kind of person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the comments of Jenny, Maggie asked coldly: "But if you are the Queen of the Empire, Do you dare to gamble on the remaining 20% ​​with your own life?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably not. The 30,000 troops who got the accident won the rumor Nie is already an unexpected surprise, and it can be regarded as having won 70%. Even if the other party has only one chance to kill the emperor, it is also a loss that the empire can't bear. Under this circumstance, no one will choose to desperately destroy the 20,000-strong army. His grasp of timing is indeed very accurate, just... this is not peace. It is only two or three years of truce."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggie s nodded: "I As said, peace is very expensive. The backbone of both sides is still there, and the price is far from expensive. Only when both sides are exhausted will there be a generation. Peace. The history of the Hundred Years’ War is like this.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What did he think?” Renee looked at the one who deterred the entire emperor* * The person, sighed, complicated and difficult to understand, "I used to know him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you like?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What about that?" Renee said in the smallest voice and turned her head. "In any case, from tomorrow, I will change it and think about how to hold it." The city is here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She climbed down the roof and walked into the retreating emperor. The troops dispersed, leaving only a small number of surveillance units to monitor the free army that gradually boarded and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;August 10, 1666 3 o'clock in the morning, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mentby West River District, Zone 3, Reni South Region<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* ********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The withdrawal of the army took nearly eight hours on and off. At the end of the crossing, it was midnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistance? Major Soleton took his "power" and stood on the edge of the dock, such as the patron saint of the Freedom Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every soldier and officer salutes him as he passes by, thanking him for avoiding the last battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For eight hours, he never left the port and gave a short speech to each of the leaving camps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone, the Republic of the Union is over. But this is not the end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today We still can't take back Lenny. But we will come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will come back later. On the day we came back, in the old province of the province On the ruins, a much new and new regime will be established."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A regime that is more adaptable to the new era."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what the content of the speech is, it ends with the same sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"New Freedom Army, crossing the Metebexi River!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dudu!" Crossing the river!" "Duohe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers spontaneously shouted as an answer, extending far and far, stimulating the nerves of the Empire surveillance forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Empire’s surveillance forces did not react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who have seen the magic of the afternoon, no one doubts that he has the ability to track the position of the emperor and launch a deadly attack. Most people think he won't succeed, but they don't dare to try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, no one knows how many dangerous wizards the Freedom Army has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the Security Minister and the group around him have never given up. Although the emperor's will collapsed and accepted the peace treaty, they still tried to find the last glimmer of hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the last boat. He will definitely board the ship." Sid Nass put down the telescope in his hand. "It's a responsible person. However, he must have thought that we would resolve their magic secrets so quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And he gave me a reminder, I found out that my previous thinking was Wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young and temporary Temporary Magic Minister Isaac Newton stood at the long table beside him, sorting the parchment on the table, face A smile of satisfaction is revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been analyzing the flow of magic all the time, which is actually a wrong direction. The South Army established typical radiation between the muddy zone and today. Type flow, the magic is concentrated on a central point, as long as we can successfully contact the center point, we can use magic like them. However, today they updated the structure of the entire magic network, and also changed the logic of interference, which makes We were very painful at the time. The magic flow is completely confusing, and the work seems to be completely random, and it is impossible to simulate a logic that works."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Newton picked up the top piece of parchment and handed it to Sid. There are a few lines of scattered text and a few sloppy paintings on the top. Almost no one can understand what is drawn, except that he can barely recognize a skewed cylinder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is...?" the security minister took the parchment and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the magic he uses, and the magic flow that our observers see. It is the big iron column that flies in the air. Magic. Its magical flow is also scattered, but have you noticed it, lord-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? Why are there so many magicians pointing to our magicians? Flow? Is he taking magic from us?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is one of the best gold medals in the association, Lord Sid. After seeing the point, according to our recovery, in fact, this magic is used in the same way, it uses all its usage and demand magic to our magician. These lines are supposed to come from the environment. Magic. There is no doubt that while he uses the glare of the magic, our magician does not do it involuntarily - I think I can name it 'simplified version' - the casting process. So the actual magic of this magic is very expensive. May not look like that It is not as high as we think."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we haven’t mastered this magic yet?!" I haven’t waited for Sid’s opening, The Ionite Hartmann of the Holy See has been eagerly inserted. "Just reorganize the simplified version scattered in the hands of our various mages..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I have already completed this." Newton took another piece of parchment. "When we infered this process, several wizards who had participated in the enemy's magic process remembered that there was a similar 'meditation' in their minds. The process. But they didn't realize that this was a side effect of the enemy's new magic structure, but as soon as they got the reminder, they immediately understood the specific working principle. We re-collected these recalled parts and got ten Three broken scrolls are the complete working process of this magic. To be honest, it is too complete, and there are even many super-magic changes and variants that don't actually happen."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidmer recites the contents of the parchment: "But it is not so simple to use it. If there is no magic aid, this magic has at least seven segments - the scattered magical structure of light is a group Amazing super-magic technology."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our gains are more than that. According to this 'distracted' conclusion, the Temporary Magic Headquarters immediately concentrates on the staff, for all afternoons. The lapsed magic has been reorganized. When three or four people use a spell at the same time, the magic work will return to normal. We thus confirm that the enemy should completely change the form of magic flow work - from concentration to dispersion. Just by the people around you agree with the same knowledge, you can temporarily make up the environment for magic work..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newton continued: "We may need to count all the mastery of the magic and plan to comb the entire emperor to ensure that everyone's magic works properly. There may be many protests and school disputes, but recover Magical power is the first step. We can also confirm that the enemy should not have recovered all the magical power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Security Minister suddenly raised his head Come, the eyes are flashing cold: "Is it only the emperor? How do you confirm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newton’s words: "Maybe the scope will be bigger. But this A large-scale law reconstruction is impossible to maintain for too long. We have observed that the magic obstacle of the 'mud area' has subsided..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too optimistic. If I didn't guess wrong, the white light in the afternoon is the magical part of this magic. This is probably a super-large magical array of two plus two forms, perhaps its power is enough to change the whole world." Sidner Wrinkled his brow, We have to be prepared to sort out all the magicians throughout the empire. Two people here, as well as Clade Lopez and another mysterious pastor in the north... oh. But we still have a chance. Newton, Did you just say that the enemy did not restore all the magical powers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newton nodded: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we will attack now, be sure to put the door to the door? The Soledon guy is here! Now we have magic, not afraid to catch him! The last boat has not yet set off!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does this not ruin the sacred peace treaty?" Ionet Hartman was somewhat worried, "That's what he swore..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We did not tear up the peace treaty, we just asked the brave school official to serve as a representative of the South Army to the Empire. He will get everything from a diplomat. Treatment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When these words were said, Sid had already put on the armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Temporary Magic Headquarters, Security Department, Staff Headquarters, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all senior casters set off, arrived at the dock before the last batch of the South Army sailed! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are so fast that everyone is nervously restoring their gain magic according to the new theory." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This action of the empire, the young man wearing a two-layered military uniform with a major epaulette, did not know anything about it. He still clung to the "power" representing the imperial emperor and boarded the last Yingtre camp in the port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finally reacted, "There is something wrong," he was surrounded by the Imperial Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not the first time I’ve met, Naimen? Major Solitton. You are indeed a great enemy, I admit, but you are still--” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sid? Naser’s words were interrupted by the other’s actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please don't fire, I will disarm. But this is not a surrender. I am only the lastee who is entrusted to be a free representative of the Freedom Army." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Major did not hesitate to kneel down and put "power" on the ground and honored the military minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, all the talents were surprised to find that this man’s red uniform is not a camouflage, and he has no medal of excellence on his chest. He was just wearing a blue military uniform and a red military uniform that ripped off a sleeve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, my major shoulder badge is temporarily borrowed, I am just a temporary lieutenant..." Because of the tension, the young man talked a little stuttering," Major school life, ordering me to wait here, to give the emperor’s tokens to you, to show... 'our sincerity to maintain peace'. He also said that if the 'power' is lost, 'the emperor is under the rule There will be some troubles when the nobility is there?'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette? Hartman laughed: "It’s a funny person. If Not an enemy, I am very interested in making a friend with the Nassell Major Solonton. Should he be on the penultimate evacuated ship?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The security minister bit his teeth and looked at the little soldier who had no magic in his body. He nodded. "Hurry on the boat. Go to the other side to help me tell your dictator and the major, who? I mean, I received it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette broke out again and laughed, and the next Newton frowned and pulled. Pull the sleeves of the bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of them, a white crow flies past the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the end of the battle day<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meteby West River<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't need power, I just need kindness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negemon? Soledon called back to his own Devil, let the white crow stop on his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His boat has passed through the river line, mixed in a large group of transport ships, he is not worried that he will be discovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the cabin are carnival, but the door does not want to join them. He knew that as soon as he showed up, he would become a wine barrel and be completely poured down by a barrel of beer and red wine. People will pass on his great achievements in Lennie, and he regrets that he did not finally make that decisive blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just leaned on the ship's side and breathed the hot, humid summer air in the night wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marshal Lopez once told me an oriental proverb, 'All the crows in the world are the same black'. However, with Anne's magic, you can summon A white crow. Our proverb says, 'This is going to happen unless you have a black swan', but how do they know that there are no black swan in the world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The door is still wearing Anne’s military uniform, and only this dress he is reluctant to hand over to the substitute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of this military uniform is a bit small, he can't tie the button, simply let the front squat open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some people think that human beings are powerless, no matter what they do or do. The world is cycled as usual, justice will never win, progress and revolution are just making more There are many disasters. So they should do nothing, just repeat the slang words of these spells."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goalkeeper reached into the inner pocket of the military uniform, grabbing A crystal sand came out. He did not hesitate to sprinkle the crystal sand along the ship's side into the Metebeisi River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you think this is wrong. You think you and I can change the future of the world together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He has no trace of sleepiness.
