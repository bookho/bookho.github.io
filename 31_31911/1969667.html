Free Army General Command<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first wave of magic saturation attack is over, endurance Press the beautiful woman around me to the player's position in front of the organ. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is handed over to you, Anne - hey, no, Miss Devil. Be sure to stop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "This thing absorbs a lot of magic, so I count as a loss. How much extra magic can the employer provide?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there is Loss should be reported to the Lenni Army Logistics Department in three copies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resist the door to deal with the devil's complaints, pull out the safety from the emergency kit Rope, with the railings on the side of the warning tower connected to yourself. After taking a deep breath, he jumped down. The safety rope is more than ten meters long, just so that he can safely stay at a height higher than the ground. A combat knife with a backhand broke the rope, and the impact of the ground made the legs faint. There is no use of two pieces of magic that slow down the speed of the fall, because he knows that even a piece of magic can't be wasted now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camp is in a state of chaos. Even with the protection of the "Taolong Melody", there are still some heavy artillery shells and magic penetrating through the layers of defense nets, squatting on the piled up materials and the barracks. Not many of the masters who mastered the middle-level magic, the officers who can use the water dragon or the rain to extinguish the fire tried to control several large flames, and the remaining officers and men flew between the fires without flies. The defending forces of the headquarters reluctantly gathered together and rushed to their posts, but no one could organize an effective attack or defense. The accents from the republics were mixed together, and some of the recruits were in chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the headquarters has not yet issued an order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak to himself, the door is speeding up The pace through the camp. At this time, the camp always looks great. The camp that can host 50,000 people is itself a huge city, but he rarely notices this because all actions and plans have taken this into account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, headquarters should now be organizing counterattacks. Of course, the premise is that generals and school officials can get accurate information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can probably guess what the staff is like: no intelligence, let alone reliable information. The scouting cavalry squad on the west side of Jena was stunned, and the magical whistle was completely shaken by the overwhelming magical force. The "Taolong Melody" sentinel is the only one that is expected outside the opponent's, but it is also supported by the saturation attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the only staff officer who is clearly aware of the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic vortex on the top of the head keeps turning, slamming against the incoming enemy fire. Although a group of acid bombs were intercepted, they exploded in a place not far from the front right side. The acid splashed from the inside reimbursed an artillery, and the entire gun group squinted and rolled in the ground. Obviously, the opponent adjusted the type of shells of the magic cannon and switched to the magic that can resist a single interception. The imperial person is definitely not a fool who has no ability to learn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the gates of the headquarters, the soldiers were sent out, and the senior sergeants were questioning where their peers had returned reliable information. Because there are too many people coming in and out, there are no even people who have queried the password. The door was frowned, grabbed the first post and reprimanded two sentences, and passed the password and rushed to the staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The quality of the soldiers has also dropped... After all, there are quite a few troops trained only for about four weeks."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsurprisingly, the entire staff is immersed in the low pressure. A large group of peers or squatting or squatting outside the office of the marshal, breathless, two magic officers are fully focused on maintaining magic. Naimeng patted the shoulder of a known officer and asked him what was going on. The man licked his mouth impatiently without even returning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, this is related to the next phase of the task, don't make a noise!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the regulations, if the other party's strength and firepower are more than double that of us, we should organize defenses and should not attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her's counter-inquiry: "defense Can you win?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. But we can make the empire’s troops lose a little bigger. And let the Blenheim’s Western Army have a little Reaction time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much more?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two days."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, what is the use of two days? Is it enough for General Lopez to come back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not enough, But enough for our magician to build a temporary transit passage to Interry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence. Heavy silence - this is a bit strange, but the whole room is in a strange silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Kingle's Fox" sitting behind the table spoke up. Within a few hours, his voice seemed to be getting older. He did not ask why he retreated, nor did he ask what it could do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is Ittray? Our Headquarters is at Lenny."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her He hesitated and replied to the deputy: "At the beginning of the attack, we contacted Lenny. There are 13 failures in the internal transmission points of Rennie, and the remaining four are also very unreliable. The Capital Defence Command It is believed that the emperor’s guards are outside the city.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We thought they were here, we thought they were there. According to the existing information they may be It may be there, of course, logically they can't be here and there.” Fox's tone is ridiculous, “And my best men want me to escape from here, then squeezing in two thousand The island on the other side of the kilometer looks at everything here and there, just because this does not know where the threat is. I thought I was a good general, you two do not have to play double spring."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent. Still a lot of silence. Hull’s voice broke the silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you are still a good general. But this is not the fourth war. It is our fault, we have not expected to be here. We have no intelligence, but we are faced with the dilemma of winning in three battles. You can't win 100% wherever you are; but as long as you are still in Interlake, we have a 100% chance to Fight once."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His adjutant inserted a sentence: "We can't lose all our chips at once. To have experienced people can rebuild the troops." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please make a decision. This way, we can safely fight here to the last person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;silence. silence. silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I allow you to build temporary transmission channels, two. One to Lenny, and one to Intre. But don't lose, you have to retreat. All the backbone units must be retired together. The outside bastards are also --"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咚咚". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door knocks. The staff whispered in a whisper, trying to find out who was in this nervous moment to interfere with the conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Special sentinel surveillance officer, Captain Soleton, has an emergency military report."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Come in." The old marshal coughed twice. "The door doesn't have to be closed. Anyway, the rabbits outside of our conversation here are listening. Now the senior officer will have magic, unlike when I was young." So good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two officers who focused on maintaining the magic rushed to pick up the eavesdropping magic and rushed back to their position to pretend to work seriously. Look like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s about the enemy’s configuration, Marshal Fox. The enemy has a very obvious weakness. It’s obvious.” Nana took a deep breath. "I guess based on the enemy's strength. This is a new tactic of the enemy. The magicians are brought together for assault. They have no reason to organize such a large and large-scale attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, they don't have ordinary troops that match this firepower, and there is no reserve team. We only need to concentrate on the superior forces-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people in the entire room Jumped up from the seat. If you say that people who don't understand this point, you are definitely not qualified to sit in this room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They didn't bring defense forces and reserve teams?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All military attacks, 斩Break their outstretched hands!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The other party has only a strong firepower, then use a dispersal formation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if you use ten ordinary soldiers to change them to a mage, it is worth it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fox coughed heavily, all the eyes of the audience They are all concentrated on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the guns of the attack ring, everyone! Now disband, investigate the losses in the shelling of the various units, and replenish the lost first-line force commanders in priority order! The order is coming!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff cheered, and the tide of paper rushed to the marshal's desk. The proud free military people think they are working in the most professional war machine in the world: once the machine is launched, it is invulnerable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gun immediately rang, setting a time for each commander to perform their mission. Based on the clock of Marshal Fox, the commander fired the gun with his heart. When the three cannons sounded, all the units that could be organized were ordered. In the nine sounds, the first unit rushed out of the camp gate in the third wave of firepower coverage of the enemy. At the thirteen o'clock, the enemy's shelling ceased urgently, and the troops began to be dispatched on the west side of the mountain. After twenty-five sounds, three Intercontinental and three Ruhrocks were ready to make a surprise attack, staying at the farthest end of the mid-range magic and the six-pound gun range. In the suppression of long-range magic, this unit still maintains discipline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door did not sign up to join the assault troops. He must live, unless he has no choice, he will not be willing to join this task that requires courage. In the end, he chose to stand far behind and watch the warriors marching quietly. In the chirping sound of the organ, a colorful vortex is swirling on the sky interlaced by the rainbow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you know if the current enemy is nervous?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite On the hill, the enemy commander is also looking at the free army that is preparing to attack. Counts Frass Rasta lamented and laid down the telescope, knowing that these free army in front of him could not be suppressed by long-range magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plan was a good idea for genius at the beginning: to concentrate the most elite troops of the empire and to kill the headquarters of the Free Army in the first wave of attacks. Eight hundred magicians and five hundred light magic cannons, half of the emperor's ammunition are here, and the two-hour bombing is enough to turn Jena into hell on earth. The Imperial General Staff of course also considered the entire plan to retreat after the enemy fell into chaos - but no one thought about how to retreat if "the other party can defend and then organize a counterattack." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much is our ammunition left?" Rasta asked her staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adjutant is probably wrong, confidently replied: "At least 70%. Let them attack, we don't have to be afraid of them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It took only a quarter." The viscount sighed. "I thought they would organize it a little slower...do they have a high section?" The mage uses artifacts to defend? Ming Lopez is not here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Free Army has only 15,000 soldiers in Jena. But for this squad of more than a thousand people, 15,000 people is an amazing number. Rasta can also conclude with the simplest calculations: the Free Army can organize at least ten times in the face of this size of assault. If you follow the empire's offensive criteria, each company uses three times, they can organize thirty times. A force consisting of magicians and artillery is incapable of resisting the wave-like impact of well-trained infantry. Moreover, he has seen the enemy begin to deploy troops on his southeast wing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens if 800 Masters and 500 Magic Guns are all left here? Rasta barely imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The premise is that the empire still exists after this failure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rasta began to talk to himself. The pressure was too great, and the Viscount could not wait until the opponent launched an attack - it was late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Retreat as planned, everyone. To the northwest, not the southeast we expected. The problem is that we must defeat the first attack before that." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Retreat." All the staff who were laying out the defense stopped and began to summon the commanders of the detachments, "Understand."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rasta knows that everyone is waiting to retreat. But the question is how to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All this is my responsibility. The magical power of the Free Army is far higher than our estimated upper limit. This is my fault. We only I can use the batch to retreat, but the question is how to divide it. It is reasonable to say that I should die here for the country; but I hope to be able to go back and take all my responsibilities and not let you be responsible for my judgment mistakes."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this speech did not work. One obvious reason is that most of the magic officers are temporarily drawn; another obvious reason is his illegitimate child status. The Viscount thought about it, took out the retreat plan, and began to arrange the order of retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, let the ladies and those under the age of twenty retreat. Then, all those over the age of 40 who are above the gold medal and the bishop In the second batch, the deputies of the temporary teams are also in the second batch, who are responsible for commanding the retreat. The third batch is the rest, but we must have some mages to take the volley."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hints in Rasta's words are obvious. Soon, the volunteers got together. Volunteers from the Liberation Knights and the Medical Knights accounted for half, and the young ones who were young and conscious were over half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hundred and fifty volunteer mages and six hundred gunners, the most determined strength of the empire. Later, two hundred of the younger potential or more powerful wizards will keep up with the team, leaving 50 people and artillery to resist the last one. If the enemy catches up, then the 200 mage and Orthodox priests will organize a second interception on the nearby farm to ensure that the main force can escape smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy's signal cannons are still ringing, rhythmically, every minute, and the length changes indicate that they are conveying commands. Rasta can see the front of a total of six companies, as well as the same number of reserve forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop all long-range magic. Mid-range magic preparation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom Army's assault began The "Go ahead!" and "Assault!" shouts mixed together to form a chaotic sound field. The total strength of the assault was about a thousand people, and they were rushing here at a speed of three hundred meters per minute. The default magical enchantment on the ground was stepped on, but the speed of the Freedom Army did not slow down. It was a powerful and accurate war machine. They were like saying to the strategists of the empire: the times are different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the time when three or five magicians can reverse the war. No, even if 800 magicians can’t reverse the war, Rasta is a bit lonely. Think about it. In contrast, the identity of the Royal Security Agent is more of a style of the ancient knights' heroic heroes -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then several green lights are triggered in front of him It is. Three or five fire walls burned, but the Freedom Army's magic officers skillfully used throwing potions to suppress them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount did not hesitate to issue the order: "Two hundred meters line trigger! Shoot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the era when most junior officers can't afford a pocket watch, these magical enchantments and bullets are necessary. The choice of medium-range magic is much more than that of long-range magic. Some of the most famous magic, such as fireball magic that is difficult to burn off textiles, or a poison cloud magic that can create continuous obstacles, will not exceed 200 meters. The mid-range repression ability of the 800 Masters is equally dazzling: if anyone uses the detection magic to see the present scene, their eyes will be burned without a doubt. The artillery was replaced by a shotgun and was also trying to shoot. The enemy soldiers were cut down piece by piece like wheat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Army’s answer was that they started using accelerated potions and defensive magic. Each company has three to four true mages and priests who begin to planly provide some defenses for their soldiers and organize another assault in the mid-range magical firing interval. Mid-range magic does not require the use of super-magic techniques, the shooting frequency is much higher, but only 30 seconds to launch four to five rounds, the loss rate of the Free Army has dropped significantly. The most terrifying thing is that no one of these six companies has retreated and no one has stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"150 meters. One hundred meters. 50 meters. The loss rate is 60%... aim! Take the enemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the battle size does not exceed 100 people The comparison is skill and ability. When the scale of the battle exceeds 1,000, the comparison is the endurance and exchange ratio of both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunner has only a short knife, and as a nobleman's mage and pastor, they prefer the sword instead of the bayonet. With the help of magic, they still have an advantage, but the exchange ratio has been reduced to two to one. The front lines of the two armies were in a mess, the magical gun positions were completely abandoned, and the explosion of gunpowder came one after another. At several breakthrough points, the Orthodox priest used the mental control and fear to cause the enemy to shake off on a small scale, which led to a larger scale of collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gunner retreats! Destroy the opponent's formation with spiritual magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rasta Slightly covered, the two-handed sword "Honour" at the waist slammed out of the sheath and covered with a layer of yellow light. There are still 400 left in the enemy, which means that even he has to fight with these magical spearmen. He took a deep breath and rushed into the center of the enemy's retreat. The slashing of the squad seems to have dissipated some of his heavy responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I command you, 'backward'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special effects on "Honours" Not strong. It’s just a moment of sluggishness, and it’s enough to make the advantages of the long weapons disappear. The sharp big sword broke off, and the sound of a pleasant break was completely different from the boring one after the stab. The wind brings the sound of the organ and the fresh bloody smell. Frasal Rasta is immersed in the feeling of taking the lead and destroying all the enemies who rushed in with the reserve team behind him. In the end, he stood down and there was no enemy around him. There were only a few young soldiers who were controlled by magic and fear. Their eyes contained real fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ammunition was fired. The first batch was withdrawn as planned, and the remaining units reported losses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He stood proudly before the magical gun position that had become scrap iron, and issued an order. The armor and military uniform on the body have been dyed red and black by the dried blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The death of ninety-five people, one hundred and eighty people were injured, the magic gun destroyed about one hundred, and lost half of the ammunition."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the report, Rasta wiped the cold sweat on his forehead. After a wave of assaults, he lost a third of the magic cannon. The enemy seems to be shocked by the results of the first wave of extinction, and more troops are being mobilized. But the Free Army will still attack. Their will is very firm and their goals are clear. The gun stopped for a while, only because the other side had to organize a second attack. The Free Army will not give him a choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Leave the wounded and fight until the last moment. You have the right to surrender." Every word of the order is so difficult to say, "No matter what. We will come back. That is tomorrow, we will come back with the most powerful force of the empire. Revenge for you. Emperor... Long live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rasta Unconsciously looked up and avoided the eyes of the men. His eyes are a bit damp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live the emperor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the roar of the wounded and the gunners. The Viscount turned and went without hesitation to the retreating war horse. The second assault of the Free Army is about to begin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he lost in this failure will be taken back tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;August 4, 2006 (mday+125) Afternoon<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mess Riverside Blenheim? Lenny Frontline<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legend has it that a mother of an Oriental sage has migrated three times in order to avoid the tracking of the enemy. In order to motivate the morale of the troops and avoid the enemy's edge, the headquarters of the Lenny Army also migrated three times on the morning of August 4. Bonnie ran for twenty-eight positions in the morning as General Bruto Luther, and even killed more than sixty enemy and deserters to stabilize the front. Now, his command is set up on a farm very close to the front line to ensure that any frontline news can be reached within five minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just received an emergency communication from Jena. The enemy magical forces raided Jena, and fortunately, they were defeated by our army in three rounds of death. Hundreds of people, injured 680 people, smashed three hundred and thirty people, no prisoners. Death and injury are more than two to one, unexpectedly fierce."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"Of course, you already know about this, Annie? What do you think should be done next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female lieutenant sitting across from him was flustered Lifting his head from the thick logistic materials, he stared at his sister innocently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say? Jena?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be confused. You heard Jena was attacked, but not at all surprised. At the time of Jena’s war, you found a logistical excuse to retreat from the front line...you set up your own reconnaissance means.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie raised her hands and surrendered: "Okay, well, I know that Jena was attacked, but I don't know how it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie lost the bulletin in her hand. "It's all here, the logistical losses have not been counted. Your face is not very good, can you continue to fight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Morning in the left wing After a few squats, the consumption is a bit big. Resting and resting is just fine.” Anne screamed at the magical force to unrestrained contract incarnation of the demon. “The enemy really does not count the loss, and the left wing is completely unrestrained. Tonight, I have invested tens of thousands of people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie shook her head and replied: "According to the statistics of the Ministry of Intelligence, the enemy has invested a lot. More than 20,000 troops - of course, some units are repeatedly invested."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like to testify for her words, the voice of the commander is passed from outside the door. Come. The two men pushed the door out, but found that the report was actually a lieutenant with the qualification of a magic officer. He was sent to the left wing in the early hours to enhance combat effectiveness, but he has been fighting until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The enemy's offensive is strong, the left wing will be broken at any time! We have lost almost all the commanders and half of the officers, the opponent's cavalry penetration has been cut off Most of the links between the company! The left wing needs reinforcements, generals!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is almost no attention to what he is saying, because all the staff’s eyes are focused on him. On the right arm. The officer’s right arm no longer existed. He looked at the section like a sharp blade. He grabbed a report full of blood with his left hand. The wound did not bleed because the military medical cloth bundled the wound violently and the end of the wound had turned blue-gray. To pass a message with a wounded person, the matter itself has already explained how critical the situation of the left wing is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s hard, let’s go to rest.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Luther stepped forward, low The voice sang a prayer, stopped his blood, and took the report with his own hands. The report was scribbled, and the writer’s impatience and tension jumped on the paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are the cavalry cut off... Our opponents are going to end the battle here. The War Department tells me how many reserve teams can invest."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff responsible for tracking the frontline immediately reported the number: "There are still thirty-six joints in the central front, and there are about twenty of them that have been reworked. Even, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fifty-six companies. About eight thousand new forces." Major General calculated the strength of the two sides, "from the center to the left wing eight If you have a cavalry, we will adjust it halfway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, is eight enough? If the other party can cut off Our communication, the strength should be a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time the objection is Anne. Not only her, but a few remaining staff members in the military also showed a strange look. Throughout the morning, General Luther chose to add fuel tactics and put the precious reserve team and reserve officer into the left-wing meat grinder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No more. Anne, if you command the enemy, what does the phrase 'left-wing is in danger' mean to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I mean... 'can work harder to break through'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. These huge investments and the effects that have been produced have formed patterns in the hearts of several marquis, and they cannot resist the temptation of this 're-energizing'. If they can launch a central breakthrough in the morning, perhaps they have already won. We use heavy The loss is in exchange for the time on the central front. In the war, it is not the better party to win, but the one who makes fewer mistakes to win."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone in the house bounced up from the position and honored the military officers of their chief. Lopez waved his hand and returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Luther, at your request, my reserve team has been transferred to the trench behind the central position. To be honest, I am a little surprised, you actually use One night and one morning, I dug up such a big trench?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major General Luther smiled: “Since time is sufficient, prepare more Nothing is bad. But how can you have General Lopez come to the front line?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My intelligence officer said that the main force of the enemy has changed, from the left I have retired a lot of troops. I have calculated the time required for the empire to prepare for the offensive. It should be almost the same, and it will come to the front line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice just fell, the earth Suddenly shaking, the deafening explosion suppressed the conversation of the officers. Except for the officer on duty, everyone ran out of the temporary headquarters and looked at the front line that was covered by artillery at the nearby observation post. Anne and Bonnie exchanged a look, and each other could see the surprise in the other pupil. In this type of shelling, it is impossible to talk, and the two exchange ideas through telepathy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this uncle estimated the error to be only two minutes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person and the person really are Different, really someone can see through the fog of war at a glance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do now? Do you want to use our true strength?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You judge yourself, my sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie is coping with it while holding up the shrapnel Force field enchantment. The other side knew that her senior priest was present and did not project a shell at it; instead, almost all the shells were accurately slammed on the trenches and sandbags of the defenders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crad Lopez frowned and walked to Luther’s voice: “The enemy reconnaissance cavalry has successfully been to this neighborhood?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The left wing was successfully penetrated by the enemy cavalry, and our cavalry fell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Well, if you are lucky, only half of the medical knight’s right wing company will participate in the assault.” Klad turned to his chief staff, “Robert, is there an artillery expert?”<br /><br />&nbsp The Chief of Staff of the Western Generals, Robert Ayre nodded: "The Marquis of Cavendish? von Fegota, the third son of the Minister of Military Affairs. Academician of the Royal Academy of Sciences, fortification and siege Expert."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is his opinion over the traditional fergos of Fegota? Maybe an internal dispute? Good news, the other’s wrong record One. General Luther, ask your artillery to shoot when the enemy begins to cross the river."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If When Cavendish heard Clade’s words, he would have sent out a similar sentiment to the Sister’s sister; but he could not hear it now. He is telling a few men to tie the big brother who is going to the front line to the headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, this fighter can no longer be commanded. The left wing he madly invested is only the enemy meat grinder, and there is another layer behind the ground. Cavendish rubbed his glasses. "When the gunfire is ready, let the reserve team enter the starting position and start crossing the river within fifteen minutes. The commanders of the units are now on the table with me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignore the Atlas von Figota in the back of the cabin, "You put me out of this idiot," "I am the right wing captain of the medical knight", the general of the Figota army We have drawn out pocket watches. Cavendish's third army was known as "the bell-like precision marching", and the pocket watch was even distributed to the battalion commanders. This accuracy is necessary for the "cannon synergy assault" he advocates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officers swayed and went to their respective units. The calmness of the north bank of the Metz River is in stark contrast to the intensive bombing of Blenheim on the South Bank. All the ammunition that had to be brought to the Emperor’s Majesty all fell on the ground. The powerful magic bombs that could change the terrain were like the iron balls. They did not consider that they were squandering the military expenses of the entire emperor for half a year. . Even from the telescope, you can see the tragedy of the South Bank position: the wooden planks of the ditch and the wooden deer's wall are lying in the mud, and the serpentine ditch that was dug up is finally opened and cut into one piece. Cut the pit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magicians skillfully dropped the instant frozen potion of tens of thousands of gold coins into the Metz River, freezing the upper part of the river. This pontoon made of ice spread out on the river, enough to let the front of a thousand people pass side by side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cavandi Xu did indeed expel a lineup of this size: 800 people in front of each line, 12 lines in depth, and 96,000 in the entire third army Hundreds of soldiers are gambling in this central breakthrough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shelling did not stop while the troops crossed the river, which caused the Freedom Army to make a slight deviation in its judgment. Until the first horizontal row of ice came, their artillery responded to the fire - the hardness of the ice surface is beyond imagination. Only a few strands and incendiary bombs caused relatively large casualties, and the remaining iron bullets could only slide on the ice to injure several unlucky soldiers. An ice surface at the end of the river was not frozen enough, collapsed under the shelling, and a company soldier fell into the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Through the Metz River, three hundred people have withdrawn from the battle." Cavendish used a telescope to look at the battlefield and quickly calculated the amount of loss. "Acceptable." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the first round of the match. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The free army soldiers who had passed the shelling poked their heads out from the surviving trenches and chest wall, using the musket in their hand and the imperial rifle stand up. Some of the emperors stood under the command of the officers and directed the shooting, while the other part began to run and prepare for the hand-to-hand combat. Obviously, the party without the bunker will suffer even more heavy losses, but the emperor has a first-line strength advantage, which can drown the opponent with a hand-to-hand combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, the first line of emperors screamed. In front of them, the flat river beach disappeared, replaced by potholes and quagmire. Countless plants cover everything in front of us, and they fill the Cavendish telescope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Phantom Line?! Such a large-scale illusion magic?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Figota On the high ground where the military temporary headquarters is located, the air seems to be stagnant. Everyone is shocked by the enemy's discouragement, and can't help but feel a little admiration: it is not to lose the arrogance of freezing the entire river with frozen syrup. The Free Army can cover the entire flooded beach with pre-prepared illusion magic on the nearly two-kilometer front! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one is alarmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1,400 people have withdrawn from the battle, slightly more than the plan. Only stupid will be happy for the illusion of magic to obscure the enemy's sight. When we look at the full When you are in the phantom of the sky, are you not seeing the illusion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cavandi is looking forward to being in the phantom jungle and has begun to untie the shoulder strap. And the men who ignited the bombs whispered repeatedly the orders in the combat regulations. "When the current road cannot pass quickly, the road is opened by throwing the bullets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a brief The visual memory of the Imperial Grenadiers, according to the regulations, bombed the trench into the trench. The lead creaked, the fire flashed, the throwers fell down, the shrapnel and the nails splashed around-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but one seems not to hear The voice: That is the sound of the bomb hitting the obstacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...There is a backslope in front of the trench and a second phantom chest! Freedom bastards!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;About one-third of the bombs were bounced back, and one-third were blown up in the open space. The rest of the bombings in the Freedom Army positions are almost as much as the bombing of the Figota Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The queue of the emperor finally became disordered, and their various companies began to blindly follow the route and were out of touch. Some of the company's magical winding vines buried in the ground clenched their feet, and these things seem to have the same effect as the later wire mesh. From the rear of the Free Army, there was a rhythmic shelling sound; with this shelling, the gunfire became more and more intense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the phantom area, the whole army opened fire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie’s commanding staff Drawing graphics in the air, launching a large magical array one after another. Clade's reserve team marched along the traffic, adding to the first-line forces, and his self-propelled artillery also advanced to the front line to begin coverage shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody taste is straight into the sky. Cavendish's head is getting more and more painful: this is not the left-hand meat grinder, here is the slaughterhouse of purgatory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three thousand... Three thousand four hundred... Eight hundred... Four thousand one hundred... Six hundred..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a team of soldiers reluctantly broke through the phantom forest, but was unable to concentrate on the forces of the enemy in the trenches. If it wasn’t for the ice that had been shelled by the enemy, some camps might have turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Invest in the reserve team! The reserve team of the Third Army and the First Army is ready to cross the river-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Although the sound is still calm, Cavendish's teeth can't help but tremble. At this time, a voice stopped him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Calm down, Cavendish! In the phantom area, the enemy can't aim at shooting, only volley! Replace the disperse bomb, shoot the friendly area , regardless of the price to disperse the fog!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cavandi shook his head fiercely and saw the adjutants dressed by the four maids, who were surrounded by the immediate Russ and his medical knight companions. He understood it all at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brucher, you actually count my third army! No wonder you support me to control Atlas, to launch the central offensive in advance!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atlas does not seem to matter. The third-ranked medical knight in history shrugged and turned the horse's head in the direction of the phantom line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The friendly bombardment of the inhumane is over, leaving only the wounded who are struggling on the ground and three or four thousand indiscriminate infantry still standing. The commanders of the various units began to reorganize the team with their pocket watches, but they often immediately became targets of enemy mage and musketeers. The loss continues to expand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Medical Knight Right Wing, Charge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All medical cadets composed of senior priests It consists of a number of trapezoidal arrays, starting from where the ice is still intact. Their bodies are covered with a variety of protective auras, worthy of the name of "the world's best-protected troops." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until this moment, the generals of the Free Army understood why the Duke of Figota was the military minister of the empire, why the Figota army dared to claim and can The army confronted each other. The right-wing company had only a total of more than 300 people, and only 200 people were involved in the assault. However, they only spent the cost of seventeen rides and rushed through the death zone that killed nearly 6,000 soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only difference between vine magic and barbed wire is that it can't stop the real elite cavalry. The first trench's chest wall was damaged by bombs and melee, and it was already fragile and easily broken by these knights; the second short trench could not stop these elite cavalry. The headed Atlas jumped off the horse and rushed forward with a flashing magic tomahawk. In a flash, the front line retreated to the third battle, and the knight's mid-range magic could already attack the Clad guns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atlas screamed and rushed to the nearest roaring artillery. A shell hit him, and he was bounced off by his skewed magic, and parabolically flew back into the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me some power to get rid of this xxx stuff, great xx gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The sacred prayers are mixed with swear words, but they can also play a big role. Atlas grabbed a lead shell on the ground and threw it out with the blessing of the "instant sacred power"; the shells smashed through the steam cylinder of the Clade gun, igniting the white fog and explosions. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The infantry who had lost their will to fight were encouraged by this and re-started to occupy the trenches that the cavalry could not care. The scream of "Long live the Empire! Go forward!" once overwhelmed the shelling of both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he didn’t know was that at this moment, a weapon that did not belong to this era was aiming at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few people have the opportunity to take their fate in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even those who once held their destiny in their own hands seldom realized that fate was in their hands at that moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a person knows that his next action will definitely affect the whole world, how can he still operate normally? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Anne Seifer took her pistol and hesitated, just as she was holding her own destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight in the scope of the "spellslayer" is obviously the commander of the enemy. She also did not think that the medical knight could break through the counterfeit modern defense system. If you enter the melee, then the Western Generals must be greatly hurt, and there is no way to rescue Jena or Lenny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "War is a random response. It is a random response. If you can't stop it, use my real magic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; There are two choices in front of Annie. If this is broken, what will happen? The failure of a free country? The empire reunified the civilized world? What happens if you use magic? Let Anne Sefer become a true nine-segment mage and then become involved in the changes of this era? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm of change is getting bigger and bigger. Her sister is like a duck in this change, and even wants to take a historic position; but she only feels a burst of confusion. But both she and Bonnie are cautiously controlling what they have beyond the ages, fearing that history is towed too far from the right track, for fear of producing powerful enemies that even they can't cope with. Keeping the power of no one knows, it seems to leave more room for choice and space for activities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least, the survival of the Republic of the Union should not be a problem. This country should continue to exist until the age of their existence. The sacred Coman Empire should not be revived. It is not sacred, not Coleman, and even less empire. This medieval heritage is not as infinitely possible as the Freedoms. It should be turned into a power of enlightenment by the door, Hugh Coleman, guiding the modernization of science and becoming the last "evil empire" in the civilized world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why do I think the goal is getting farther and farther..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thinks I have been doing the right thing. She feels that she has been using power correctly. She feels that she can rationally treat some events that are different from those expected, or the characters...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or characters. Or a character. Or a character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the end, can fate really be held in the hands of a person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if she is the strongest magician in the world, or a passer of time and space? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold handle seems to be a bit hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne shook her head hard and expelled these cranky thoughts out of her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no choice, isn't it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is Anne Sefer, a nine-segment magician who chases illusory things. Keeping history on track is to maintain the last hope of nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"metaheightened-metaextended-precise-"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left hand puts a heavy double-layered demon bullet into the pistol, and the right hand does not move the barrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this age, she did not have a sniper rifle to use, only relying on this magic-enhanced pistol. Three hundred meters is not difficult for the artillery. It is not difficult for the rifle, but it is too difficult for a large recoil pistol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To win on the cruel battlefield, only converging all humanity, fighting with instinct cruelty. Annie held her breath and carefully extended her perception in the enemy's control area. She even took back all the magic that was borrowed to summon the devil to concentrate on completing the blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal seems to be saying something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell Cavendish! Give me the opportunity to continue to expand the battle -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
