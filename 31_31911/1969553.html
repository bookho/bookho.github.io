			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The front row is back! After the line!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As most wars, plans It is only effective at an early stage. After annihilating all the cavalry of the other side, the current situation is completely out of the expectations of the Dwarf Commander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his calculations, the dwarf should be able to completely exclude the lizard knight from the lineup - but because of the huge golden magic that was not calculated, The lizard cavalry rushed into the center of the battle. Fortunately, this kind of battle is not something that you can't cope with. Only one point made him particularly concerned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Master has never said that there are priests who can use magic weapons among the barbarians..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The female Taoist who wears a golden robe must be the key to the other side. Even dare to dress so conspicuously, it really is fearless... Now, she has summoned the magic weapon to protect her body, it is not so good to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also has some self-blame: it is too underestimated. Before that, the woman should be attacked with Feijian when she is not ready. If the master is there, I will see that this kind of retreat is a good one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This Dadongzhou will be the root of my future. But there are many barbarians on this wasteland. We have to turn one or two of them into farming, for me. To use it, to support them in conquering the rest of the barbarians, to establish a century-old foundation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This national policy has been implemented for more than 20 years. It is because of these words of the previous generation that his sects will go to this extreme overseas to help these dwarves. Nowadays, there are more than 100,000 people from their own country, and they live in harmony with the dwarves. On the coast of the west, they have established a “East Sea Capitalist”, which is also very successful. Unexpectedly, today, the barbarian actually has a spell...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is someone privately transmitted? Or is the barbarian thinking about stealing? Even... is totally different... another...? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of it, a burst of sound and burning sound pulled him back to reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the entire battlefield, it suddenly ignited a big fire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fixed his eyes and saw that the enemy’s lizard knights did not step in as they did before, but instead formed a whole group of battles by the previous battle. A fist-sized glass smashed into the array. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This glass smashed into a human, broken out, a strange sticky gel, attached to the human body, burning in case of fire, to burn out before it can fall off. Those barbarians also dumped a black liquid on the ground and let it flow into the array. When the black liquid ignites, it burns into a piece. The person who has been stained with the colloid in the glass will be burned to death immediately; the dwarfs who walk in battle are hard to avoid the black water, and those who ride the lizards can use the mount to escape. Burning fire wall. Some dwarves roll in the ground, but rolling can't extinguish the burning colloid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this? Is it a fire thunder? The barbarian has a fire thunder!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He is running fast, thinking back to the fire and thunder bombs he has seen before. That thing can produce a spell-like effect, which is very sharp for setting fire, and can't be extinguished when it is lit. This kind of fire and thunderbolt was listed as a banned device by the court, and it is rare to see it. If this is a barbaric deliberate...the barbarian in front of him...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt a bit of chill and immediately issued a new order. "All listening orders! The teams are grouped into twelve guns, each fighting against the enemy! Beware of enemy fire and thunder!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice It was too big, and both Red Wind and Reza noticed him. In the gray-iron dwarf battle, this white man in a white robe is particularly conspicuous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Breakthrough!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red wind waved and instructed all the lizard knights to be white Target attack. The dwarf's battle has been burned, and it is impossible to stop the action of the lizard knights. The green, black, and brown lizards formed a sharp knife and quickly inserted into the depths of the dwarf, straight to the white man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well! Say no, today I have to violate a ban and use Feijian!" I realized my own mistakes and realized the imminent crisis, the commander of the dwarf I was shocked and screamed out the name of my flying sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is obviously higher than others, but also wear a conspicuous white robe, for fear that others do not know that it is an important goal?" Just as the white man calls for the flying sword, the person whose target is also obvious is being judged inside the magic image. . Leisa read the mantra and instructed the ghost to move in the direction of the white man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few "beep" sounds came to her attention. She looked out through the observation port and the air exchange port of Ganda, and happened to see the red-colored flying mangling passing by from the left side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene made her hold her breath - just for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the crimson flying mans are all on the left arm of the Golden Devil Warrior, and the sound of "Dangdang" is combined. A piece, turned into a deafening explosion. The huge force pushed the entire Golden Golem back, and Leisha hurriedly grabbed the safety rope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Boom", the huge Golden Devil fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza explored her head from the inside and found that Ganda’s left arm had been completely shattered, and the broken gold pieces fell to the ground. Obviously, this thing can no longer be relied on in the short term. She couldn't help but feel the pain in her mind when she thought of the repair costs she had to pay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this magic? I have never heard of any magic that can strike the defense of the Golden Golem! Not to mention the hardened surface..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climb out of Ganda and use the blazing rubber to scare away the nearby dwarf. She began to look at the white man carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dress of the other person looks a bit like a mage robe, the hem is wide, the cuffs are wide, and there is no collar. She has never seen this style of clothing. The color of the clothes is simple, white and blue, and it is not the standard color of any magician of the Arbitration Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This guy, where is it sacred?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the white man is also looking at her . The thousand points that have just been recovered have been reclaimed into his hands and turned into a red sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know when the sword is covered with tiny cracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing these cracks, he hesitated. After all, he took the flying sword "small" back into his arms and was not willing to continue using it. If you do this again, it may really make this flying sword completely broken, which is what he does not want to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This golden man magic... is so hard that it can shock the 'empty'! Even though this hollow is not longer than the force and longer than the speed, this kind of hollow Hardness is also unseen! The origin of this woman is such a magic weapon, it is necessary to abandon the national righteousness to help those barbarians? Unfortunately, unfortunately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The thought of pity and cherished jade disappeared in his mind. The demon woman colluded with barbarians, and it was unforgivable to commit the people of my heavenly sanctuary. Today, we must eliminate all evils! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, he took out five raids from his arms. The Scorpio Five Lei Zheng Fa, is the strongest magical magic in the division, and has always been the same as the Feijian technique of the division. Even the golden magic weapon, it should not be able to withstand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reel? This strange look, what is the magic scroll...?" Reza observed the "reel" in the hands of the white man in the distance. . This distance is not very clear, but it can be determined that it is not the kind of scroll made of parchment used on weekdays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw two lizard knights screaming, cutting down a few dwarves in front of them and rushing to the white man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the barbarian attack, the white man will shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put on his sleeve and pulled out a "reel" in his hand, licking the name of the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"天;罡;五;雷;正;法......破!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Dao Xun Lei flashed through the air and accurately hit the position where the character fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dazzling thunder of light makes everyone unable to open their eyes; the thunder of thunder, so that everyone is swaying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leisha felt dizzy in front of her eyes. She couldn't understand the language used in the spell, but she saw spells that she had never seen before and never heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard who can eject the electro-optic light from the fingertips, there are no thousand or eight hundred in the arbitration association - but who has heard of the wizard who can control the thunder? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods are on, how can magic reach this power? Isn't it mentally over-consumed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless, that is a completely different kind of magic system... one is not for practical use, but purely for the battle to use the natural working system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was staring at the red wind leading his cavalry in a brave, hopeless attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If this Master is so strong... How do we beat him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and those brutal Different people, she knows the limits and abilities that a mage can do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and appeared in front of her eyes was the black cloud that was about to be pressed onto the grassland. Today is a day that is quite suitable for Ray Magic work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be in line with her thoughts, and two reels flew out of the white man and nailed to the ground. The thunder fell, and the Tosca people who were hit were falling from the lizards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of him, spontaneously give way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are comrades for the king because of the secular authority; people are polite to the pope for the spiritual faith; people for the god of war are for the fear of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no people who have given way out, they are already dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The follow-up barbarian infantry shouted and rushed up, but stopped before the thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This road is covered with carpets woven with blood, and the God of War from the Eastern Heavens stepped on the carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the reason for too much thunder, the dark cloud began to turn into a raindrop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the prairie, there is a gradual appearance of wet markings, which then turn into leeches and finally into a red stream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire, was ruined. The water was burned and was washed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves who escaped from the sky looked at the sky, thanked them for the blessing of God and their ancestors, and the time when the white man resisted the enemy’s main force alone, behind Reconstructed the battle<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield's overall situation seems to be reversed again...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just at this moment Another god of war, riding a red lizard, appeared on the red carpet and the other side of the stream, stopping on the way of the white man. At his feet, the bodies of the dwarf lances and the musketeers were piled up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Khan's Khan?" The white man stopped and asked in the dwarf language. During this time, he quietly took out the "stencil" from his sleeve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chieftain squinted at him, driving the dragon in the first two steps, also in the dwarf language: "Toska's red wind. I am honored to be with you. Fight, Master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The destiny is not on your side. Did you see the rain?" The white man smiled, the right middle finger and the ring finger clamped the flying sword. Meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red wind clenched the gun in his hand and shouted loudly: "The destiny is just a storm! Your musket, is it not invalid? It is now You may face me next time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on." The white man no longer speaks, the left hand shakes, the spell comes out, throws The position of the barbarian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tosca’s leader responded with a shout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his shouting, the rain suddenly became bigger and turned into a downpour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leisha hides under the protection of the Golden Golem and squints her eyes and tries to see the other's dynamics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She heard a thunder burst and then a burst. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, she seemed to see a reddish red flashing behind the curtain, while the third thunder exploded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outcome is already divided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tianlei still has flaws after all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Wind believes that he has found a flaw. His companions will not die in vain, they use life to point him in the direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party needs to be able to call the thunder, and the thunder will only hit the position of the character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, as long as you spot the thunder, you can definitely flash! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the power of lightning will be distributed to the surrounding. But the anti-magic armor on his body can slightly isolate some energy - this is enough to isolate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sting of the remaining current is completely negligible for a true Tosca man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red-red figure flashed against the light of the first thunder. In order to stay away from the thunderstorm as much as possible, he has stood up from the dragon lizard on the back of the lizard and leaned forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well! Not in the middle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White people are a little surprised this time. That female Taoist is nothing, this barbarian can not be afraid of the thunder? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excessive use of the method will greatly consume the individual's true elements, remember, avoid. The benefits of heaven and earth, too much use, will suffer from the robbery "The master's embarrassment sounded in his mind, but now he can't care so much." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white man endured the pain, and pulled out a five-ray symbol from the fingertips, and yelled at the barbarian Khan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough." Seeing him pull out again, Tosca's face showed a triumphant smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second lightning flashed down. This time I successfully hit the lizard...just a lizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Wind I have already made an effort to jump from the dragon back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave up his partner who had been with him for many years, only to win the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red-red figure passed by, and the lightning fell behind him. The proud big lizard chief, the reinforced gun in the hands of the strongest lizard knight, stabbed the white man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of his eyes, suddenly there was a redness, as if a group of gorgeous butterflies flew over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Hot’!” The white man shouted in his language, and the flying sword that had already been prepared was taken out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flying sword immediately turned into countless tiny hues of flying, forming a red shield, blocked before the reloading of the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red light broke into a powder as soon as it touched the gun; but the momentum of the thorn was reduced by more than half, only pierced White man's left arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the flying mans are attacking the barbarians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red wind only feels that the body is getting lighter at once. It feels like being in the sea, and the waves of one after another have pushed him far back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fell heavily in the rain, just behind the already sturdy mount, covered with almost the same size of wounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two fell to the ground, rolled down in the mud, gasping with a big mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“As long as the hard-lined dwarves are defeated, the Tosca can have a fixed home and be able to unify the tribes and build a country like the whites...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Red wind wants to stand up, but can't help it. There seems to be a lot of holes in the internal organs... The tribe has no pastor and no doctor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What if the tribe would be if I died here... What if the tribe would not die here?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whites on the east coast, and whites on the west coast. He has seen those great civilizations, and those who have special powers are even the corners of those civilizations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can go to the countries where the whites are built, how good it is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This is the last thought in the mind of the great chief, and then he passed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The barbarian Khan, really brave and unparalleled. It is no wonder that these dwarves are not on weekdays."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The white man--it should be said to be a clay man--reluctantly pull out the tip of the gun on his left arm and struggle to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left arm is bleeding, the pain seems to lose feeling; but he can't fall here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, there is the golden robe female Taoist, who must remove it for the country! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his own hollow. The flying sword has been broken and can no longer be used. He feels a little pity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing him stand up, everyone took a step back in horror. Even the strongest warrior on the entire prairie has lost, who can stop his pace? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stand up, Ganda! Block him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golden Devil lacking an arm Like a dummy, he stood up again and stood in front of the white priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"螳臂挡车!天罡五雷正法!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resist! Electric energy Protection!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men shouted their own spells in different languages. This time they all heard the other's language: it is not the language that they know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exotic magician?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Women's Taoist priest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a thunder, the fragile blue protective light vanishes. The Golem Dummy fell back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza realized that she was completely exposed to the torrential rain - in front of the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a pity, a foreign female friend. For the right way in the world, you must die here. If you are not my family, your heart will be different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leisha heard that the other person said something in a language he did not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“天;罡;五;雷......”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a way? Is there a way? Purely relying on protection, it is impossible to win... must attack! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A glimmer of light flashed through her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ganda, stand up! Go forward!" Koman's alchemist shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Positive; Law...!" The Taoist priests of the Hua Dynasty read their enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"trans...!" The Koman alchemist completed the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Broken!" The Taoist priests of the Hua Dynasty also completed the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left arm of the Golden Golem turns into a steel needle, slamming into the white priest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
