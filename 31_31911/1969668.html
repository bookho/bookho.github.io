			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;August 5th, 1696 (mday+126)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jena Freedom Army headquarters<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in the early hours of the morning, hundreds of Freedom Army reconnaissance cavalry flew between the narrow valleys and hilly areas of the rich rivers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the entire western warning line has been dropped by the enemy, this time their reconnaissance network coverage is three times larger than before, and all the investigation units are also each other Close to each other to ensure safety. A reconnaissance unit with an air detachment was sent to the southern hills to understand the speed of action of the main empire of the empire - movements no longer need to be understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, continuous combat and alertness will reduce the morale and combat effectiveness of the investigative forces. On the eve of the upcoming conference, Jena’s headquarters was brightly lit, and a night-time buffet was held for the soldiers who had been struggling, fighting and fighting. Thanks to the wine region, the fine wines of the fine wineries are sent to the long table like water, and they are placed side by side with hot bread, chowder soup, steak and other foods. It is almost unthinkable to organize a banquet and logistics supply of this scale a hundred years ago, but it is accustomed to the current Free Army: unconsciously, the organization of the military has been substantially improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is said to be the tradition that began with the first free war, when the militia often carried out a brutal guerrilla warfare with the emperor, a daily battle. After the end, all the foods that can be found will be made into dishes for sharing by those still alive. This feast has become a tradition, a habit, and a means of improving morale at a critical moment. From the Marshal down to the recruits, everyone knows that Jena will become a sea of ​​blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, in the eyes of the looted pro-Imperial aristocrats and the landlords, this so-called feast is a shameless plunder. Later, these old southern aristocrats who fled to the north entered the emperor's government in large numbers, helping successive emperors to gain an advantage in the competition for local aristocrats, and also became the most determined force to implement the southern recovery policy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wine! Go on thirty more boxes!" "The cooking group, the main course is not enough, add the main course!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is noisy sound coming from the ear. After a whole bottle of wine, the scenery in front of me seems to be shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Actually...hey...just was the original Free Army wanting to eat and drink in the name of the battle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;??? Soleton blinked and swayed toward the distant banner to find the toilet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banner should have been written "The First Day Victory Celebration"... But now he has not seen it clearly, and every letter seems to be shaking. It’s a mistake to get up and eat the nightingale, he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain Soledon, I fought under your armpits during the last assault, long time no see, cheers!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain Soledon who saw the imperial scheme? Come, to win!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you walk through each table, The soldiers who had a common incident recognized him and toasted, and the doorman had to smile and deal with the past one by one. The other half of the bottle was down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wine can increase the magic of the magician, don't be afraid, captain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This irresponsible speech... oh... I have to be with you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stomach has started to protest, just like a few naughty The baby dragon rolls inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not on the first wave of tomorrow's strike list? Hey, really not? That is, you can drink eight hours after the magic recovery is necessary. Four o'clock!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, this is also...嗝..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upper I quickly calculated the amount of wine I drank, and now I have two cups and two bottles. It seems to be three cups? It's a bit unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least for our company to have a drink! My company is in the second wave of charge during the day, Captain. For the martyrs, cheers?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, only your company can't. My company is in the pursuit of the task, there is a row left, I am more qualified to have a drink?" Another officer with a bad laugh on his face, " Captain, come on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My brother is the company commander of the first wave of assault troops. This is at least two cups, Mr. Captain?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Naimen? Soledon himself still has no consciousness, but he is already a celebrity in the military. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s not the big man who is mad at Lopez’s arrogance, but the ability to endure and the good fortune is also his job. Widely spread among the various units. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning of the civil war, the loss rate of the army after the Battle of the Rulkock has exceeded 50%; as the best army in modern history, the Free Army has the tradition of taking the lead in combat. The loss rate of officers is higher than this figure. There are very few officers who have not missed every battle. From the rebel camp, the development of the army can be a life-threatening animal. Most of the soldiers are happy to drink with such a colleague in order to get a little good luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unexpected savior suddenly appeared when the head was sore and the stomach was uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, Blenheim’s new news is coming. Blenheim is great, the enemy has retreated over the Metz River! Long live the Republics!"<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman in the red officer uniform just dropped the news and dragged the door to the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pressed the cap very low, because Anne Seifer himself should be in Blenheim. The devil's miniature wings are pressed into the military uniform, causing the arms and shoulders to be slightly unnatural. The red military uniform she was wearing was taken from Metty Crosso. Before going to Blenheim, Anne sent a lot of military uniforms and daily clothes that I didn’t leave in the army, but I couldn’t wear them because of the height and size of the chest. It was just the same as Annie’s. Guy wears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This cheers seems to be overturning the entire camp." The urge to resist vomiting under the pressure of the door asked, "Is there anything more, Devil Anne?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon like Anne looks shrugging: "Nothing is too great. Brignney's Figota army, smashed in front of the trenches The enemy's losses should not exceed 3,000, but they left the medical knight's right wing forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your master seems to be doing a good job..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go faster, I don't want you to get drunk on me." The door is like a pool of mud, stumbled by the impatient demon beauty The girl dragged out of the banquet venue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I booked the contract, I didn’t think about rescuing someone who was poisoned by excessive drinking. It’s extra spending, but I’m I want to ask the summoner for the money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the military camp, someone was very uncomfortable with vomiting to interrupt the devil girl's complaints. Empty the body's ethanol toxins, breathe the cold wind, and endure the door? Soledon feels a little awake, sober enough to start telling jokes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wine table is even more dangerous than the battlefield. The officers who died on the wine table are more than the heroes who died on the battlefield..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since there is no danger to my life, I will go back first." Devil Anne frowned at the vomit and turned away and walked away as she appeared. suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After learning a new knowledge, the original summoning creature is also a playful character. However, is this the character of the devil or the character of the demon summoner? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The midnight military camp is a magical place. There is carnival here, there is silence, there is death, the warning line composed of password and sentry separates the three. After several warning lines, he stopped in front of the quiet camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camp that can accommodate 50,000 people is less than one-third of the current use, and many of the camps have been permanently vacant. Looking up, I can see some strange light flashing in the stars. There are still magical beams in the sky from time to time, and the air squads of the two armies chase each other. The other side's magical forces are also fully fired. No more concealed marches and casters are silent. The dragon knights will fly straight over Jena to investigate the movement of the Free Army to meet the troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wine rushed, and the door-to-door gathered magical power. A meteor with blue light in the air, unscrupulously put a set of all-out tracking missiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purple light gathered on the tip of the right finger and flew out. One hair, two hairs, the magic gathered in the third hair, and disappeared in a blink of an eye. Still not enough. He is still a poor second-stage wizard, and even the minimum magical requirements of the school's military officers are not up to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still not working...Bastard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is a bitter smile and starts running All the way, shouting the password tonight to run to his own camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Driving into the canvas door, he was not surprised to find that Devil Anne had arrived first, lit the oil lamp, and was taking care of her own sleeping bag by his bed. . He passed the devil and stumbled over his already laid bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will the wine wake up?" Devil Anne was slightly impatient with the tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have to make a bed in your summoning contract? It’s really hard." The door leaned over and stared at the demon who was adjusting the sleeping bag. "Or, is this the requirement of your cloned personality?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just fine." Devil Anne paved the sleeping bag and turned to hold the chin. Looking thoughtfully at the door, "Would you like to turn around?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is a trade-off between the drunkenness and the gentleman's demeanor. Or still turned back. Although the other party is not really Anne Sefer...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I am just a little curious. Your character is from the owner, that is to say, Anne. Is there also a demon character?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the sound of the demon hangs on the military uniform, and the metal fittings collided with each other to make a crisp sound. "In a logical sense, yes. Summon the character of the devil until the moment when she and the summoner set the contract to take effect, because all thoughts, abilities, and appearances are obtained from the summoner. But in a strict sense Speak, no. Do you think that a person will have a fixed personality? Everyone has a lot of personality, and it is not surprising that you don’t know. Is this really true, is it important?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two of your thoughts can be connected? I have no ability to summon intelligent creatures. The literature is different from each other. I used to chat with other magic officers." At the time, they said that some summoners were arrogant and summoned creatures to encroach on the body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what to explain...the horror story is just Story. Magic is logical, as long as you follow it, there is no risk.” The background sound is the rustling of the cloth, and the summoning of the summoner and the summoned person is like magic communication or the soul. induction The amount and content of information can be controlled. If the summoner does not have a minimum mental defense, it may cause each other's thoughts to erode each other, but now the summoning magic contains this part of the spell. It is more difficult to lie. It’s not that hard. Don’t say that we’re here, even if you’re peeked, if you don’t say it, you shouldn’t know that?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The wine is over. Resist in the mind of the door. Devil Anne said so, it seems a bit rude not to look back? But she is not Anne herself, and Anne does not have permission. He couldn't help but whispered his head and swept it with the corner of his eye--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oil lamp immediately went out with the demon silver bell-like laughter, she The figure got into the sleeping bag in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I know you don't really want to peek. Should there be something to say privately?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a request that sounds stupid." Hesitantly hesitated. "Can you please don't protect me, quietly go back and protect Anne herself?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devil Anne laughed out with a smile and laughed and rolled around in the sleeping bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You... Are you serious? You don't need protection, Anne needs? You can estimate the difference between her and your magic, young magician ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was scratched and grabbed the hair: "She can summon the demon. Ten times or so, I think... at least."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who doesn't want to live until the end of the war? I bet everyone in the military camp thinks about what to do after the end of the war. It is a dream or a dream, but every soldier has a future. Painting. In the field of the painting, we ran forward, ran forward, and ran forward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say it. Naimen couldn't help but say his thoughts by means of wine. Anyway, the other side is just a demon, and eventually disappears into the void with the end of the contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Like this war, one day, magic will spread to everyone's hands. When I return to Lenny, I will study myself." Magic, lowering the cost of low-end magic items. I am a war hero, I can borrow money, I will open a factory next to the St. Grace welfare home. Products are sold through the pure gold of the Safir, to change people Life. Maybe I can hire Renee to come back. She has a good idea and can work with Mr. Zalt to invent some useful new things, such as cheap illuminators or tablecloths that can quickly produce food. In two years, When I am twenty, I can automatically get citizenship. Maybe I can support Luther’s party and try to improve the military system to prevent the tragedy of civil war from happening again. I will get a golden badge in 20 years. The research book with my name will be placed in the public library of Lenny. At that time, I will show off with my friends: In the most dangerous time of the motherland, I am in the most dangerous place, in the war. central In the storm, together with the colleagues who may never see again, the whole box is sipping a bottle of wine, fighting alongside the demon summoned from a different world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Probably because he was already drunk and incoherent, Devil Anne interrupted in a scornful tone: "But if you die, this will not come true? For my contract, you better still 乖乖——”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes! I don’t know if I can live until the end of the war! I exercise my magic every day, but I can’t control it until now. The three magics. So many people who are stronger than me and dreams better than me, are very casual on the battlefield. I know a few officers who led the offensive today. Some of them graduated from the second place in the military academy. In Imiah, there are farms that can feed eight thousand tenant farmers. Some people have published papers in the Southern Magic Association Newsletter. We can't control our own destiny, but your master can. I often think if we have capable magicians can More, The end of the day will not happen. We don't have this magic, but your master has it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devil Anne sighed: "Who dares to say that he can Control the fate? They are dead, but you still have a chance to live. There are many fearless people, especially in the grave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course Fear of death! I am as fearful as everyone here! I certainly want to live! Like everyone here, I want to live! But I don't want to increase the chances of living by damaging the magic of others! I am a combat staff. Competent, but I am still the operational staff of the entire Lenny Army. I have to judge what is good for my army, this judgment will not be changed by my own likes and dislikes. Do you know what the core of the magic strategy is? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I seem to have to take one more sentence to continue? Devil Anne smirked and screamed. "Please continue, staff." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was stunned, but still coughed and continued to say: "The role of the magician in strategy, and the gems on the magic circuit." The same: you can fill a less important position with a good gem, but you can't fill a significant position with a bad gem. At the heart of the magic strategy is to use the strongest mage in the most appropriate position. The value of a senior mage is much higher than a team of lower-level wizards with the same magic output. The magician and the priest are not artillery, not consumables, not in the past, not now, not in the future! It is the empire that does not understand this and will have a fiasco during the day. Let a valuable senior mage consume magic power to protect my low-level magician. It is really putting the cart before the horse. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even the senior mage volunteered? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can figure out how much magic a summoning demon needs. What is the difference between weakening the power of his comrades to protect himself, and this is a different from the coward who abandoned the friendly army? What do I have to see the comrades who died in this war? As a combat staff, victory is my responsibility. I cannot allow our precious power to be so abused. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But is this really your responsibility? Is this responsibility more important than your own safety? Your life and death may not have any effect on the outcome of the war. Why not struggle to use all opportunities to survive? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The logic of the door is still the same chaos, but it sounds less drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know if we will get better after the rule of the Empire. I don't know if there will be lasting peace. But I know that. My faith will disappear. Then I will no longer be me. The province is my motherland. I was born in Lenny and grew up in Lenny. I am a magician in a free country. I don't know how to describe it... ...this is why I am my reason. My belief is my magic, no matter how weak or how ridiculous it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He narrows his eyes , read the purest spell, the right hand to the top of the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...energyfire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver light hits the canvas , or one or two...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have reached three stages."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have reached three paragraphs."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people counted at the same time, and stood up at the same time, looking at each other. The two palms touched each other in the air, making a crisp sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was raised again and the same spell was pronounced. In addition, three pure energy flames cut the connection between the three small holes, and the canvas fell silently. The moonlight and the light of the search magic overlap, shining from the new hole in the canvas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devil Anne whispered softly. "Now you are no longer a low-ranking mage. See you tomorrow, Mr. Mid-Mr., I will consider your suggestion." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please. Once she is in danger, even a little more magic is good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lay down again and silenced for a moment. The door can see the sleeping bag rolling back and forth, seemingly fighting something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, maybe a bit too curious. Are you Miss Miss Sefer..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The resistance to the door stopped for a while. His fingers are faster than lightning, holding the devil's lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, haven’t the demons ever heard of the curse? Talking about certain topics before the battle will bring death to death. Even all the bachelors of the Lenny Army Interested in her, no one will talk about this topic tonight..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes looked at him mischievously, and seemed to be distributed in the dark. The green light is as if you want to suck him all in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t see the face of the demon in front of him, but he felt a guilty heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finger was collected, but no one still spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a surge in alcohol, which translates into a headache that impacts the end of the brain thinking circuit, just like the feeling of running out of magic, just like thinking when it is stagnant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told himself that he should know that this is not Anne. Being tempted by demons is very dangerous. This is the eve of the decisive battle, and the curse of the war god is always there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it doesn't work. Just like in the charm, there is no reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every magician should know when he is in the enchantment, and then use the will to fight -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But I don’t know why I don’t want to fight. This is a deep proof of charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has counter-magic magic, and has repeatedly practiced against enchantment. No one but Ninica can fight his willpower, even the teacher Zalte or even General Lopez can't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot count. Can't count. Can't count. Can't count. Can't count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
