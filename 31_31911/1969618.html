Are they all part of the Free Army, but are they going to attack on the night of the Shennar Festival?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The parliament actually approved the declaration of war? How is it possible?! Shouldn't it be approved by two-thirds of the members?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't chat, the above order, this The camp immediately supported the attacked perimeter guards! The company ended the dinner in five minutes, gathering!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news of the enemy raids, one time to Fort. There was some confusion in the inside; but under the command of the officers, the chaos did not last long, and the atmosphere of the celebration was quickly replaced by combat readiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the collections, the first level of alert! The troops are in their own collection area, the garrison and the artillery team rushed to the city! The second group as avant-garde out of town Blocking and ensuring the safety of the various guards!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is closed; Lieutenant Soledon holds a large bundle of maps and walks along the channel below the north wall of the fortress. Walking, and passing on countless colleagues. The eunuchs of the intelligence department are nervously investigating the location of the enemy and the war situation of the various departments. The commanders of the command department supervise the operation of the entire fortress guard. As the eunuch of the logistics department, his mission is to go north to the fortress wall. The temporary war room under the cover carries the map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lieutenant, hang up the biggest map of one to five hundred, and then take a few small dots." See him coming in, Captain Itis Remind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door hangs the tactical map of the outskirts of Fort Vatican on the wall, Thane; Constance and his adjutant immediately came over to mark the latest situation on the map. Several red squares and arrows clamped the two guards in the northeast, and the blue arrow representing the second group was reinforcing in that direction. Including Radz; Marshal Govar and Ega; senior officials, including Lieutenant Colonel Eugen, are sitting in danger and seriously observing the operational map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eugen, sum up the current situation." Gowal pointed to the map, "What is the current situation on the north side? The enemy forces are clear "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lieutenant Colonel stood up and walked to the map, rarely chewing anything in his mouth: "The enemy is currently attacking the third in the northeast. And the fourth guard. The flag is the third and ninth division of the Fabian army. The specific strength is unknown. If compiled, the third and ninth divisions should have nearly 20,000. But given the ninth division resident In Brandi, there are more than 600 kilometers from Fort Vatican. Even if we start to guard and mobilize from the beginning of the month, it should be too late. We speculate that according to the banner and the number, there are about 10,000 enemy troops in the face."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goval's slight jaw: "One thousand people are one and a half times our North Shore defenders. Lieutenant Colonel, should you have a draft of the battle plan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Eugen continued. "Because our military forces must guard both the North and South Shores At present, the 7,000 people on the north bank may be inferior. The best way at this stage is to use the artillery fires of the four burgers and the fortified city to stay harassed to the enemy's supply line. We are in the northeast. The main force of the 8th Division has been moved to Voltkagrad in advance, and it should be able to reinforce soon. Since we still have the advantage of the river so far, it can easily be dispatched on the north and south shores. It is expected that the arrival of the reinforcements will not be a problem."库 < br 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库 库The first division of Fort and the general reserve team composed of the fourth division of the direction of Shengsen have also arrived in Kengler and can also reinforce us within 12 days. At that time, our army will have an advantage in the strength, and it will force the Lenny. Reach our political requirements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marshal took a pen, ruler and compass, measured the amount on the small map in front of him, and stroked: "So, the enemy What is the change of the Southeast Army?"<br /><b r />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Constance pointed to the map and reported: "The three defenders in the south have not been attacked. Our reconnaissance on the south bank thinks that the Lopez army has not been in at least three hours. May be mobilized, probably the early arrival of the North Friends arrived unexpectedly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the report, all the staff members have probably bottomed out, Look down and meditate. There are 10,000 in the north and 8,000 in the south. Whether it is the South Bank or the North Shore, the enemy is at least two to one ratio than ours. The enemy on the North Shore is a famous "French Division"...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not at all? It is night. Even if the enemy uses artillery, it is difficult to attack the Fort, not to mention the reinforcements." Someone raised an objection. "In order to prevent the loss of successive attacks, it is necessary to send additional reinforcements. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a gasping scorpion slammed open the door and rushed in. When he was in the Flamingo Contest, Nana had seen him in the second group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fourth...the fourth defender has lost! The second regiment has encountered a hard battle with the enemy breastplate cavalry and has retired to the main fort and the third fort. In the gunfire coverage, ask for reinforcements!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room suddenly became dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's better to think about how to break through." Someone suddenly said such a whisper, the deliberately low voice could not hear who it was. Everyone listens very clearly in a quiet environment. Everyone is slightly embarrassed, only Marshal Govar and Lieutenant Colonel Eugen look as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After meditation for a moment, Eugen finally stood up at the table and asked, "How was the Fourth Guard Fortified?" Is the fort still fighting? Most importantly, what level of gunfare has he heard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reporter, the fourth guard before we arrived The third guard is still fighting, we can hear that direction... I think, it is not very intense gunfire. We used the army's light cannon and spear to resist the enemy cavalry. At present, the war is still in a state of stalemate. The firearms are already on the bayonet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eugen nodded: "It’s hard, let’s go out and take a break. Cousin What is the result of your observation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detective who has been keeping his eyes closed has licked his face and opened his eyes: "The fourth guard is indeed falling. However, the protection is still intact, and the 'eyes' I have set there have not yet expired. There are artillery pieces on the head of the third Weibao Fortress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard the questions asked by the lieutenant colonel, even the slower staff has reacted. Itis opened her mouth first: "What do you mean, the enemy is probably just a light forward striker?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. I heard When the other party hit the banner of the two divisions, I was skeptical: If two divisions arrived, why did they have to play so many flags to let us identify their strengths to take countermeasures?" Eugen stood up Come, go to the map, pick up the red pen, modify the various red rectangle symbols on the top to indicate the enemy, and change and say, "And now I have confirmed this: they only have cavalry and light artillery. If you follow the freedom The number of standard war horses of the military, their total strength will not exceed 6,000; even with the temporary requisition of horses, they will have a maximum of 10,000 people, and almost no weight."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door slammed the number of firebirds, and slammed it: "It turns out that they must have secretly requisitioned that part of the firebird!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement caused a low laugh. However, Eugen is very serious about this information: "Lieutenant, your intelligence is very valuable. We can believe that the other party is specifically collecting firebirds, hoping to create the illusion of the army. However, due to the number of leading troops The flamingos they collected were so limited that we didn't find this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff of the staff bowed their heads and thought it all; Even the marshal nodded slightly and expressed his approval. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we take into account the lack of enemy forces and the expedition of the laborers, the best decision now will not be to stay awake, but to concentrate on City counterattack! We can mobilize the defensive fortress from the South Bank, and the remaining troops concentrate on all efforts to defeat the enemy all at once. With the second group as the anvil, the remaining three groups are used as hammers, directly hitting The enemy's flank."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eugen's nib is waving on the map, the blue arrow is split into two paths, passing through the second guard and the third guard , in the position of the red rectangular square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you listen to the plan, it is a perfect plan. Do you have any objection to this plan?" Radz; Govar looked around the meeting room. From the words of the marshal, he heard that he tended to adopt this program, and most people were interested in picking up the spot - except one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have objections."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although there are some abruptness, I have to point out that the plan of Lieutenant Colonel Eugen’s plan is too much. All these speculations are based on a few unreliable facts. These facts can be completely reversed. Explain - for example, the enemy is hoping to lure us out of the city, and then use our superior forces to solve our army in the field."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lieutenant colonel smiled slightly, with a sting Retorted: "No, I don't think that kind of possibility is very big. If the other party really has the superior strength, it can be used directly by the artillery to attack the city during the day. There is no need to choose the night. The night battle is not for the party with more troops. A good choice, because it will cause unnecessary confusion. You know, this is a tactical problem... Major?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I don't think This is only a tactical issue. After all, there is inextricable contact between our army and the current 'enemy army', and I have to suspect that some special circumstances are suspicious."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constance is cold and cold immediately  go with. When he heard these doubts about his loyalty, Eugen finally couldn’t laugh. He subconsciously groped in his trouser pocket, took out a cigar with a weak hand and lit it. The crowd did not react for a while, and they only opened their mouths after a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Itis, the former Lieutenant Colonel, did he smoke?" asked the door with amazement. Not only is he a newcomer who is fascinated, but almost all the officers below Marshal Govar are experiencing the same emotions - Ega; Eugen is a person who smells smoke and empties others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis face has a worried explanation: "He chewed gum is said to stop smoking. I have worked with him for four or five years, only saw one or two Times... Every time he starts to smoke, his opponent will be unlucky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disregarding everyone’s surprise, the chief staff officer just smoked one by one With a cigar, staring at Constance with a completely different look on Peace Day. After the two sides confronted each other for a minute, the gendarmerie major finally couldn’t help it. He went forward and screamed: "Lieutenant colonel, please don't waste time. Excuse me, this time, you have a lot of records in the gendarmerie, you There is no doubt about the work attitude and communication. I must oppose the plan you proposed because of responsibility. These records have been submitted to the Marshal. If it is not such an emergency, I did not want to ask in front of everyone... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goval frowned: "Major, isn’t it time to pursue traitors? Although the number of communications in Lieutenant Colonel Eugen is a little more, But I have seen that those are just ordinary chills and justifications about their choices, and there is no insinuation or code..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, our gendarmerie The team's work must not be wrong. If Eugen is suspicious, then his proposal must be suspected, even if it sounds reasonable... I hope to choose a safe and secure plan."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Waiting for help?" Eugen sneered at the disdain and smothered the cigar. "What about the four guards? What about the second group? If the other side is just a pioneer cavalry, now they will not break them with the help of superior forces. When? If you really doubt me, then I am willing to take responsibility for the misjudgment of this battle--or the betrayal that you think. I will not stay in a safe place. How do I personally command the reinforcements? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constance sneered: "Go to surrender?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I want to surrender I had already surrendered that night. May I ask the Deputy Chief of the Gendarmerie Department, who rescued you from Lenny's siege? Isn't that our special operations department?! If you still have doubts, please send a gendarmerie company to serve. My guard is good - whether it is defeat, or I want to escape or surrender, you can put me on the spot. I swear by my reputation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Constance seems to want to refute, but he was beaten by the marshal. It sounds stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough! You both stop. Now is not the time to argue about this kind of problem. Are you going to let the friendly forces shed blood?! Eugen, follow Your plan to arrange the attacking forces, Constance to adjust your gendarmerie company!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goval's look is harsh, but there is a helplessness. Now that almost all of the troops are lacking commanders, he really does not have much choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following." Eugen replied immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Following..." Constance’s answer was unwilling and worried. He immediately turned and pushed the door open, and quickly walked to the gendarmerie, leaving the remaining staff to face each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, everyone in the staff. For the sake of your boss's life, come and make a perfect plan in ten minutes?" Eugen pulled a big map from the wall and spread it on the table. "We have to invest All three field groups, from the South Bank Fortress to mobilize troops to replenish..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is probably the fastest-paced operational plan ever established by the staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gate of the fortress was opened again. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combat plan has been conveyed in accordance with the first level of the Freedom Army’s practice. The head of the team can see the enemy forces hundreds of yards by the power of night vision. Every company commander—whether it’s magical or not magic—is familiar with all emergency signals. They all know how to act before they are in contact with the enemy and know where their troops should be. There is no cover for their march, because the most important thing is to attract the attention of enemy cavalry who are attacking the second regiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temporary staff moved to the wall and is now responsible for Peter; the second chief of staff of Cousin. In Eugen's promise, he went to the center of the battlefield and carried out the front line command under the guard of the entire gendarmerie. What remained here was the magic users who were responsible for the light signal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door; Lieutenant Soledon stood by the wall, holding a twilight telescope borrowed from Cousin to monitor the battlefield. The contours on the map turned into hills, fortifications, and castles, and the criss-crossed red and blue arrows became living soldiers. The familiar figures look at this distance, just the surging black spots. Pointing the objective lens farther away, you can vaguely see that the soldiers of the second group have been surrounded by the enemy from the northeast to the south in a semicircle, relying on the mounds and the waist-deep trenches and the northeastern enemy. Fighting - no, I am afraid it is said to be stubborn. The artillery of the Third Fort is no longer roaring. There are several sections of the south wall that are twisted into oddly shaped steps. It is probably broken by magical officers using magical stones or deformations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It looks like the battle is not very good." Nanimen whispered to himself, and now he is hoping for a rebel victory. Like most things in the world, a friend of a friend may not be a friend: the Fadis is his teacher Clade; the friend of Lopez, but not his friendly. What's more, he has already had some good feelings for these people in the staff department...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We don't know what the situation is, you should report the situation, lieutenant "Itis reminded me that she was waiting to send an intelligence signal to the army below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door carefully observes the black spots of the same uniforms worn by the wearers, trying to describe in more professional terms: "Well, the enemy south wing is working and the second The regiment was in a mixed battle, and our army took a slight disadvantage..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he reached the fourth guard over the farther and crossed a red Rays - In the Freedom Force's magic signal, this signal represents "discovering new threats, warnings." He immediately observed the actions of the enemy and found that many of the teams were slowly retreating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...No, wait a minute, they started to collect the team. Notify the Lieutenant Colonel that the South Wing enemy has discovered our army!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis nodded and shot a red light beam at the low end in the direction of the main force. According to the scheduled operational plan, after being discovered, the first and third regiments were turned to the northeast, ready to retake the third defender, leaving the weaker fourth regiment to continue to support the besieged friendly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, your plan is to take back the fortifications and cut the enemy. It’s too risky. According to my personal tactics, you should consider it. The enemy puts the reserve team from the north to bypass your main force and attack the possibility of your back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this familiar voice, the door is over, no Unexpectedly, I saw Fransol, who was wandering around; Lord Rasta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Knight, shouldn’t you be under the control of the gendarmerie? Can the Constance monster allow you to wander outside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, it’s not a stroll. Your gendarmerie captain is very smart. He thinks that in the case of the gendarmerie, there are only enough manpower and magicians to control me. I can't leave here, I have to discuss tactical problems with you." The viscount replied with a smile. "After all, if you lose, I will probably be tied up by the fascists with ropes and hanged."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
