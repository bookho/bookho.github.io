			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xvii<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Isaac; Newton gave him the gravity control of his hand, he also I always think that the task tonight will be very smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His army successfully reached the periphery of the former camp, did not touch any monitoring magic. There were very few people on the wall who stood guard, and they obviously didn't know how to start the defensive array on the wall - it should have turned the entire wall into a fire wall in an instant. They rely only on artillery: the twenty-four-pound standard cannon that weighs 5,000 pounds. This is a nightmare figure for the traditional idea of ​​moving magic. No wizard in the world dares to say that he can move objects of this weight; but for gravity-operated types of magic, the weight of the target is not Serious Problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least, Newton climbed to the top of the wall with a relaxed mood, ready to make these artillery fly to a height of thirty meters and then land with a light magic. Wrecked into scrap iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he never imagined that the 5,000-pound cannon would try to bite him after flying! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Awful! Is the other high-ranking mage crazy? Actually activate this big thing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; If it is not his quick response, the entire right arm will fall into the muzzle. Newton cursed the opponent who left the triggering magic, canceled the reversal of gravity, and quickly withdrew the threat range of the long gun. He was keenly aware of the gunpowder barrels piled up together when the intelligence and the goblin were similar and the eyes of the empire were twenty-four pounds of standard cannons - which is a vivid name for the creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the gunpowder barrel is quite awkward, but at this moment Isaac really has no time to think about whether this is a trap. He reflexively fired a fire arrow, and then...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a natural soldier who attracted almost the entire camp. A simple but effective alarm device for advanced spellcasters... No, it's just tailored for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Throwing lighting sticks!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the voice, the other’s commander is like a woman. Under her command, thirty or forty iron rods engraved with a simple lighting circuit were thrown over, and the walls within a hundred meters of Newton's vicinity were illuminated as white. At that moment, Newton felt like a mouse in a cage. He knew that when exposed to such light, he would soon become a live target of the musket. He hurriedly lost a dark spell to cover up the whereabouts, and he added the magic of speeding up to the dark safe zone. Who knows, the other party immediately issued a more exaggerated order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lighting area extends to the left and right, and the amount of throwing doubles! Each row is shot at a suspicious target!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; With the arrival of reinforcements, the number of lighting sticks has doubled! This number shocked the youngest professor at Imperial University: the cost of lighting rods was four or five gold coins per unit, and the South Army actually put this thing on the bottom of the soldiers! In the emperor, many low-ranking knights are not equipped with such expensive aids - they would rather take the money to improve their weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the sound of the collision between the meteorite and the gun machine sounded into a piece, and I don’t know how many propellants were lit at the same time. The piercing gunshots and the leaking sound of the lead bombs left him with the idea of ​​saving magic. The problem now is not how to complete the task, but how to keep your life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...reversed gravity well!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he heard him read This mantra, commanding Anne of the Freedom Army in the fortress; Sefer immediately identified the identity of the attacker. If Newton's invention of gravity control is a versatile general-purpose spell, then the reversal of the gravity well that he used to save his life is an explosive special killing spell. Compared to traditional meteor showers, high-explosive fireballs, blizzards and the like that consume amazingly pure killing magic, the power of reversing gravity wells is not large, but the price/performance ratio is much higher, and it can be used with a little magic. Large people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this "power is not too big" is compared with the more advanced special killing magic: if you just want to kill the ordinary without falling from the height of the training Soldier, its power is already enough. You know, when there is more than one such magic line-of-sight queue, the entire queue will be pulled into the sky like a wave by reverse gravity - and it will fall down after ten seconds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne immediately began to detect the magic, reading out the number of reversal gravity wells that Newton was or was preparing to provoke, and secretly snarled. Obviously, this young and great scientist has been put on the blood, with the intention of defeating all her main forces in one fell swoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is Isaac; Newton, you can't kill it. It will be a big problem to kill him..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for her to think of countermeasures, the screams of the soldiers have already sounded. The first and second gravity wells were hit on the two wings of the team, and the third gravity well was directly directed at her position! More than one soldier slammed the trigger or dropped the gun in a panic, and the horrified screams and crashes completely disrupted the original discipline. Anne, who was flying in the air, reflexively held down the hem of the coat, only to think of wearing a military trousers instead of a skirt in the weekdays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Awful, start with a sincere... If this person can't really kill, really want to kill him here!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also cursed Newton equally, her right hand raised high and threw the corresponding magic to her own "above" - ​​the lower part of reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"meden (super demon: extension)...soften (softening)!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The magic effect stretched out, and the hard-paved foundation suddenly turned into a sponge mat. The broken pebbles used to pave the road became like colored rubber jelly, which felt a strange touch. Newton’s gravity well continues to erupt, but it has not caused actual damage. Even if it falls from a height of 50 meters, it can only create a large human-shaped pothole when it falls onto an infinitely thick sponge mat. Seeing this scene, Newton suddenly felt that his feet were a little unstable, and there was some dizziness in front of him - not because he was walking on a sponge mat or seeing the colored jelly flying in the air. He subconsciously stepped back two steps and met the wall. The wall is also soft like mud, and a hand press is a hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This army actually has such a powerful caster? Such a wide range of instant super devils! This is really troublesome... huh? Wait a minute, the city wall ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newton’s flash of light flashed and he looked up. Sure enough, the queue of the Free Army opposite was a mess, and many people’s guns sank below the ground, and they were trying to dig their own weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opponent’s mistakes will only exist for a short time. He crossed his arms across his chest and took a deep breath and slammed it into the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"forcewave (force field wave)!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible huge force hit the jelly Like the wall, immediately hit a pit, countless softened bricks flew out with this blow. Unequal deformation recovery, Newton made up the same magic, the wall finally can not support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene is like a dream for the emperor's death squad waiting outside the city. No one expected that the sturdy masonry fortress would be tilted like a mud city and drastically collapsed to the ground. Until the ground fell, the soft, cake-like wall was still a whole, and the wedge-shaped bullet-proof structure happened to be a ladder for people to climb. For a time, all the officers were stunned, and no one thought of stepping on this thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reinforcement! Reinforcement! What are you waiting for!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last is Newton’s shout Pull them back to reality. The emperors took their guns and weapons and started to charge on the collapsed walls of the soft candy. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the battle near the wall is fully intensified, the guards of the door and the prisoners of war are fighting the invaders in the absolute silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Said to be combat, but until now, they have not seen the invaders. But Lieutenant is sure that the enemy has indeed arrived here: in addition to the anti-magic array they have set up, there is a larger silence, which covers the entire camp where the officers are captured. From the perspective of the scope and duration of this silence, there are absolutely famous casters in the enemy's ranks. But I don't know why, the opponent did not immediately release all the prisoners of riots, and even did not go to the several buildings where the soldiers were detained. Instead, they went directly to the area where the officers were detained and laid the silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you release all the prisoners of war?" Nylan tried hard to think about the other's motives, but couldn't grasp the context of their actions. “Does the other party kill us in silence and use our uniforms and weapons to let all prisoners escape? But in the case of such a senior caster, there should be no such necessity at all...”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bundle up. Don't give the enemy a chance." The doorman simply ordered. His current course of action is simple: all the prisoners are subdued before the enemy launches the riot, so even if they really sacrifice the enemy, they need more time to organize the riots. By that time, Anne might have come with the main force to support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, wait, sir? What are we doing wrong?" The captives grabbed the cards and protested. "This is against the practice..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I won’t hurt you, sorry, please bear with me. The second class executes the order and the others go to the next room!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left several soldiers here to bind the prisoners, and the rest of the people returned to the silence outside the house. In total, there are still three military residences for prisoners who have not been disposed of, two detained men and one detained woman. The three houses were originally school residences and are housed in a separate small courtyard. Every house in the yard is black with lights and looks very abnormal. The door was touched by a gun, and the short sword was taken from the belt and held in his hand. He made a gesture and asked everyone to be alert. They carefully touched the hospital--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thunderous sound immediately sounded: "Stupid heretics, let go of the weapon, listen to God's teachings!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of silence has suddenly disappeared. All the walls in the entire courtyard are lit up at the same time, just like white! Every soldier, including the resistance door, was attracted by this voice and turned to look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a crystal ball that exudes divine light and floats in the air. I don't know why, as soon as they stare at the crystal ball, they can't move their eyes again. The sound seemed to be getting bigger and bigger, and everyone could not speak. The door was alert and slammed the tip of his tongue and restored his mind. He turned his head and tried to reorganize the troops, only to find that all the soldiers had fallen to the ground - four or five officers and captains knocked them down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is not a certain number of people on the other side, only to attract the attention of all of us in this way... I knew that the troops should be properly dispersed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before he could see the situation, the attacker headed by him had already rushed to him. The age of the man is not too light, wearing a plain Orthodox priest's robe, can not see the high level of the priesthood, but the various colors around him to prove that it is not easy to be with the generations. In desperation, Nexus threw out his most skilled attacking magic, trying to disrupt the opponent's attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Burning Hand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames are sprayed from the left hand of the door, but The priest in front of him seems to have not been disturbed by this magic at all, and his right fist hits him through the fire net. Jeter; Newton is a very traditional pastor who must control the situation with control spells before the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fixed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both use very low-level magic, but The effect is completely different. Only the attack magic spells thrown by the lowest-level magic of the door is absorbed by the protective magic of the priest, but the priest's body-building has seriously affected his actions. Naimen only felt that his hands and feet became very heavy, and he seemed to struggle without any struggle...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the yellow light came out from his shoulders and dissipated The effect of all the fixation. Resist the door to think about the origin of this spell, taking advantage of this time to roll up and climb a house with anti-magic array protection. Instead, the priest recognized the magic and stopped in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trigger Freedom? Can someone who can get this magical item be so conservative with attacking spells?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, the cardinal of the battle has been somewhat unable to understand the actual strength of this young opponent. The other side wisely fled into the protected area of ​​the anti-magic array, and if he also chased it, he completely lost the magical advantage. If it is another house, he may give up, but this one...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The young people pick which one is not good, but they want to choose a female dormitory." It’s not going to follow up.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jet sighed and took out the priest’s cane as a weapon, and cautiously followed them with a few officers. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Awful, the high-ranking priests of the empire are so willing to be cannon fodder? Not only women, but even the retired uncle is going to the front line... Peace of mind to teach the elderly Isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All he can count on is reinforcements - if the soldiers who stayed in front are smart enough and Anne's situation is going well enough, the reinforcements should arrive in about fifteen minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five fifteen minutes. Is it enough to be killed about 30 times?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is fast Stepping to the third floor, quietly pushing the door of the top bedroom. The inside is also dark, only the moonlight casts on the floor through the window. Just as he was about to break the window and escape, the oil lamp on the bed was suddenly lit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are the battle over, Uncle Jett? You... are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak The gaze of the man and the gaze of the door were in direct contact. The two men looked at each other for about thirty seconds and no one acted. Olia is out of shock, and the door is out of helplessness. At this moment he thought of a lot of different plans, but did not expect even a way to let the woman in front of him not scream. As long as she screams, he is destined to die here. No matter which country's order, the small-scale commando will not leave prisoners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, Miss Pastor, don't make a sound, please? I am begging you." Nanimen took the first two steps and broke the deadlock with a smile. He didn't know why he would say such stupid lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...ah?" Olia screamed for a long time and was suddenly vented by this sentence. "Qi...I? Are you an idiot, lieutenant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe. You know, when people are nowhere to go, they will always do something stupid. "The door raised the pistol and pointed to the window of the room. "Can you borrow a road from your boudoir?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olia stood up and walked. Go to the window and look down. "It seems a bit troublesome. You pick the wrong way. There is no balcony underneath. I am afraid I will drop my leg when I jump."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is close to the window, down Looking around, I had to nod and agree with her. He leaned against the window sill and his index finger hit the window. There is no way to go before, there is a chase after, even if it is used in the anti-magic array? If you cancel the anti-magic array, you can safely land, but this will certainly not escape the chase of the high-ranking pastor...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see, if you escape from the attic How? Is it still too late?” Olily suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door sighed: "Thank you for your kindness, but I am afraid it is too late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice just fell and the door was kicked open. The lieutenant fired a gun and shot it, but the other side had already estimated his possible reaction. The two guns outside the door responded accurately to him. He pulled the female priest around him and fell to the ground to escape the shooting. The stray bullet broke the window, the glass slag splashed, and he subconsciously used the body to protect Olia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" Jeter shouted out loud, "Let her go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Hearing this sentence, the doorman who had just raised Olia did not hesitate to grab her neckline and pointed the gun of her own gun at the forehead of the female pastor. Of course, he is not savage enough to put the newly fired gunpoint directly on the woman's skin - this kind of thing he can't do now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s yours! Stop all the weapons!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear him In this sentence, Olia struggled slightly and whispered blushingly: "Will you turn your face too fast? I am not prepared yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Sorry, I can't do anything." Nana answered with the volume she could hear. "This is not the first time anyway... Hey, why is your forehead so red? Is it okay?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably... I can't help it." Olia was flushed and her voice was getting thinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From outside the door, Jeter; Newton’s shouting: "No, it’s you who put down the weapon, Lieutenant, don’t point the gun at her head. It is too late for you to let go of the weapon again. This is the advice..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to hear the door. Because at that moment, Olia; Hugh; the mysterious talent of Coleman's blood called "Royal Cocktail" worked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, he will never have a chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long, long time, he realized that it is absolutely impossible to make a real life of a Norman royal family in direct threat. As long as this condition is met, the instinct of this blood will be motivated...and then, all threats will be swayed. At Lenny's time, it was Olia's instinct that blocked an implosion; now, all the anger of this instinct falls on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Royal Cocktail" attack is fast, accurate, and powerful, taking advantage of everything that can be utilized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is a knee hitting his abdomen, followed by a beautiful 180-degree turn and a powerful chest elbow. The right arm of the door-to-door gun has been caught by her, and no effort can be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the elbows made him lose his balance, Olia had a shoulder-shouldered fall and left him with a gun on one side of the wall. on. Even so, she was still unsatisfied, grabbed a chair and walked up to the door of the door, and lifted it up high - with her current arm, there is no difference between this chair leg and the sharp edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just kidding, it really will die..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting up and looking up, looking at the eyes of the princess, the princess, suddenly appeared in the mouth a strange word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."I saw the sunset falling on the wall of Lenny. 'Confirm.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; Jeter; Newton suddenly widened his eyes. The glare of his body, which was suppressed by the anti-magic array, almost disappeared. Only a permanent effect of the magic is still working. That is the welfare of the goddess of fate to the cardinal, they can see the possibility of a short-term future to some extent. That sentence is the password to unlock the anti-magic array! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He foresaw that the lieutenant of the Freedom Army quietly raised his right hand and aimed at the heart of Olia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really don't want to use this trick...but I am sorry. meta sculpt (super magic: plastic)...burhand (burning hand)."< Br />/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The controlled flame starts from the right fingertip of the door and dexterously burns away-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This magic did not have the ability to injure Oria under the protection of a royal cocktail, but it was enough to ignite all the remaining five propellants. This is the last trick that he will not save his power. The gambling is that the general magician will not specifically protect the ridiculous bullets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five shots are so close, even those who fired it can only hear a deafening bang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"砰"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge recoil makes him unable to hold the pistol. Five silver bullets were concentrated in the palm of their hand, hitting the target closest to him -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jet; Newton. I don't know when, this high-ranking priest rushed over and was between Nami and Olia. At this distance, these magical silver bullets undoubtedly hit the cardinal without any protective magic, and all of them were nailed into the ceiling after his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle Jeter...?! You are protecting me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Royal The effect of the cocktail is over. The disappearance of power is as fast as it comes. Olia's face turned from crimson to pale without blood, and she went to Jeter with her last remaining consciousness; Newton's side. From a very young age, she knew this outstanding pastor who served as a court priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not be sad for me, don't blame myself. I will be here not because of my own will, but because of God's revelation."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jet; Newton said quietly and closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliah’s knees were soft and squatted, and the upper body was unable to move forward. The door was busy throwing a gun, catching her body and holding her up. Several prisoners of war are hesitant and do not know what to do now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
