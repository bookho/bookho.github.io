			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xx<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;August 5, 1666 (mday+126)<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;South of Jena, west of the king's river<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After eight hours of rest, her magic is all recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde girl creeped up from her sleeping bag, stretched out, put on her military uniform, and walked out of the camp. The captain on the bed was still asleep, with a relaxed smile on her face: she hadn't seen him laughing in reality for a long time. Day after day, there are enormous pressures and choices between life and death. A wrong command may mean that the whole army will be wiped out. There are only serious marches and free and easy carnivals in the military camp, and there is no room for easy smiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He should be having a sweet dream?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another blonde girl in a red military uniform Lying on the roof, looking at the glow of the glow. The girl who came out of the camp gently tapped the ground and jumped onto the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I pretend that I am still fun, Summoner?" She yawned on the roof and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real Anne Seifer impatiently pushed the devil's head: "Substitution, dead demons. By the way, you are lazy I will not pay for the performance. The rest of the night I will replenish you at night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female devil licked her lips and made a noise: "Hey, you Will this layer of personality be too small for the public, master? You are almost the world's strongest magician, and the poor employees of us will not lose their meat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s already been the case anyway, what's the image, it doesn't exist anymore. Besides, is it not human responsibility to care for the devil? If no one summons you, your life will be It’s boring. You guys are just the sum of human collective subconscious beliefs, and it’s useless to make more money.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devil Anne is a little anxious: However, what if you can't pay the bill if you have an accident today? Can I find the one downstairs? I was only a little late last night-""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne Sefer laughed casually: "I? What happened? Miss Devil, I thought You have some basic understanding of your summoner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She raised her right hand, and all the sunshine seemed to have gathered in her hand for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been a long time since I’ve liberated all the magic like this, and the power of the cockroaches keeps coming. It seems as if I have recovered my true self. The magic that overflows from itself is intertwined into a light net, and the whole body is entangled from the fingertips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If someone can surprise me, let him give it a try?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The magical power of Anne's body suddenly swelled to the extent of fouling: at that moment, she seemed to be composed of flesh and blood, but by pure magic. The bells of the entire camp rang loudly. The officers of the early morning run were stunned and looked forward to the situation. They thought that the equipment was out of order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devil Anne opened his mouth and couldn’t say anything for a while. After a long time, he squeezed out a sentence: "Are you really a personal class, Summoner? You The source of this power is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this question, Annie took up the magic and thought about it with her head in her head. The conversation with the "that person" last night still remains in my mind, and the memory is a bit confusing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just acted in accordance with my own ideas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The will to fight, like never before high. Not for defending history, nor for Bonnie’s request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just because I like...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the era from which you came from. I like the country in which that person remembers. Like the future that that person portrays. I like the extent to which this dreamlike scene is reproduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it spans the times, even if it is different, the essence of the two guys is the same. For the so-called dreams and sense of responsibility, you can give up the nuisance of your life and life. Annie can't leave the same kind of guys anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I promised. I set off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She flies faster than the dragon Speed, crossing the hills to the south of Jena, west of the King River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows how many people are there, knowing better than the Jena headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the failed raid on August 4th, the emperor has given up the raid plan and replaced it with a strong march. All masking magic has been removed, and the caster is silent (all wizards use anti-detection magic and stop active magic use) have also stopped. The strength of a road that can pass through a fixed time is limited. If you want to speed up, you must use all the roads as much as possible. The Imperial Forces marched in a queue of battalions and rushed to Jena along six roads between the hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least one imperial brigade on each road is advancing, which constitutes a situation of sub-commitment and attack, with a clear emphasis on speed more than stability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temporarily established force number is the "Imperial Army", a glorious number that dates back to the Age of Elf Empire. Taking the Royal Guards and the First Army as the main body, the total strength is 50,000, of which 33,000 are the main force, 15,000 are in the back of the temple, and 2,000 people lost contact in the surprise attack yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unit has 75 per cent of the Imperial Expeditionary Force, 60 per cent of magical users, and 55 per cent of artillery . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unit is from the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Armed Forces of the Empire, Noel Public, Canne Fort, Sotalan **, the first and second armies of the Soma Principality, the first, second and third armies of the Pythagorean Principal, and a total of twelve military mobilized their elite units, compiled into sixteen different sizes. Brigade level combat unit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commander-in-Chief is the Minister of Military Affairs, Duke Loren von Figueta (bishop-level), and the Deputy Commander-in-Chief is the Minister of Security, Sid Nath. Gold badge level). In the army, the chief bishop of the court, Ingrid, and the court magician, Platinum, Victor, have 1,300 casters (currently 800 people). The elite troops drawn from the four great knights have five consecutive companies. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether relying on the right wing of a medical knight to break through the quasi-modern defensive position of the Figota army, you can still use the white blade to defeat the 800 casters. The Jena Free Army can't compare the impact with this empire's main army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she saw the array of opponents, she stopped. It was a queue that was not too dense, but could not see the end, mixed with a large number of horses, vehicles and artillery. The detection array flashes like lightning, and the clouds in the sky are abnormally gathered and scattered, and the clouds are arranged in the shape of various magical emblems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Left. Central. Right. Middle right. It seems that there is no way to include the far left and far right wings."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Anne is just a person, but to challenge this force that has a strong combat power even if it is assessed by modern military standards. Even in the first two years of the civil war in the mid-19th century, the ratio of artillery and magicians between the East and the West was nothing more than that; at the beginning of the civil war at the end of the 19th century, most of the reserve forces could not even reach this standard. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the case of Eastern idioms, this is called... not self-sufficient? Are you brave and arrogant? Breaking the boat?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she is Anne Seifer. Anne Sefer, the sorcerer who saw the magic limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The greatest increase in magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is shrouded in blue and gold spiral rays. If not, if not. Converted into the badge system of this era, the Wizards Association will probably send her a limited edition badge...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought of it, she laughed. "At least use the secret silver and fine gold to make the base, and then use Orihar Kangjin and the sage's stone to engrave the initials of my name? a?s sounds pretty good."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical booster of the artifact level is placed on the wrist, and the lens of the blue crystal stone is lifted with the index finger, saying that it is very serious to relieve stress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Transformation is complete."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking softly to increase the concentration of the spell, sitting on the bloody red fly, looking at the blue sky and the green Earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Invalid spell enchantment. Momentum defense wall. Remote sensing trap. Detection sensor. Also... Temporary network synchronization protocol!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the spell is flying, the relay points are spread out, and the magic circuit in the brain trembles. All hormones are secreted in large amounts, just like feelings in love or after drunkenness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The physical layer is established with the data layer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clouds, wind, sun, rivers, all It is part of her magic network. Plant a relay point in every place where natural landscapes are magnificent, and master the position and coordinates of everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The network layer is established with the transport layer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rock connects the rocks and the trees connect the trees. The wind connects the wind and the water connects the water. The element is data, the substance is memory, and it acts as its magic processor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The session layer is established with the presentation layer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle of the Julesian hills Use the magical mudslide to wash out the huge gullies and form a huge magical array full of natural magic. The magical circuit of the magic array flashed the magic of her injection, and then naturally worked. The power of so-called "positive feedback" will become bigger with each cycle. Of course, all of this will only connect to Anne's own mind. As long as she is willing, she can see every soldier of the emperor, every step, every breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Application layer building. What I want is the order in you. My belief is my magic! Temporary magic net, build!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shines on the blue-blue magic glasses, crystal clear, just like being inside the "soul of the soul." The blue background is visible in the field of view, and the magic points are clearly visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne grabbed her sapphire pendant, and now she finally has enough power to start this artifact. Enter your search keywords in your mind. In the age of no modern magic net, she can only work with this already solidified database. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Search your knowledge base, the proof of the soul. How did the Masters control this hilly land in the war of 1679? In the southern line of the Battle of 877, how did the total retreat of the prominence use this terrain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heritage of another person has been exhausted, but There is still local knowledge that is comparable to the entire Magic Net stock. She has read a few battles that use the magical advantage to cut off the enemy's connection with each other, and I already have a calculation in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Search and analysis are carried out quickly, and everything follows the records in the database. The Kengal-Lenni section of the King’s River was difficult to sail, and the empire had to rely on land for resupply. On both sides of the Wangren River, there are complex terrains in which the hills and valleys are interlaced. There are many weaknesses in the construction of the roads. It is the battlefield where the wizards are free to gallop. Klad Lopez's entry into Kengler was a fancy to the weakness of the road, and in one fell swoop he forced the imperial concubine to a desperate battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Download the terrain into your mind and let the magic fluctuate for a long time to fill this body that can use ten magics. The new body built by the wishing magic is designed to be a magician, and the magic output can be loaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an arc and spark between the fingertips, and a temporary magic net is built around the body. This network puts Jena Blenheim All the scattered magic of the region has been mobilized. The ground rushed, the portal flashed, the plane of the plane trembled, and the ancient magic relics boiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magic strategy is to put the most suitable caster in the most suitable position. If we need to stop the enemy's main force, then there is only one caster. Suitable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, this time you don't need to use the wishing technique, you need a defensive battle. The moment that Anne Seifer will go all out - a rare moment in the history of magic. The top mages have never been willing to do their best, they always have the strength to make a move and then move - therefore, the deaths of most top mages are not worth mentioning, they often die from some "how is good" accident under. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this moment on, she is no longer an officer, but a cold-blooded hunter who silently waits for an opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical hair turns from gold to golden red, fluttering in the wind; Pegasus' blood-red wings spread like a crimson dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter how many known history will be destroyed. It doesn't matter what the world will be disturbed. It doesn't matter how many people who would have become great people. Just intercept the enemy here temporarily..." She shook her head sharply. "For the survival of the free country, please forgive me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pegasus sneaked down to the highest On one of the hills, behind the valley and hills of Jena, in front of the emperor who is burying his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, is this order of magnitude too much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parts are compiled only Numbers, but seeing it with your own eyes means fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the scope of her gaze, there are four black spots that are hard to come to an end. The front and rear are spread for up to 20 kilometers, and the front and rear sides are 18 kilometers apart. The far left and far right wings cannot be accommodated in the field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of a two-row camp column is 900 meters, one brigade has six battalions, and each road has at least two brigades. Forty-eight thousand people are on a broad front, so it is so difficult to stop. This unit can advance seven kilometers per hour and will arrive in Jena tomorrow morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the 33,000 people in the main force, 25,000 are in front of her; and two hours behind them, there is the back of the temple. Ten thousand people in the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No spellcasters are silent, large and small aristocratic officers are busy using magic for command, communication, and investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic Array Fill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic flow summoned from the different worlds, along the canyon The flow of the magic array begins to fill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s so far... edge confirmation. Magic suppression."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic flow has arrived The enemy striker is going to the end, and the end! Next, the enemy forces gradually advance, gradually advance, and gradually move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detective cavalry appears on the edge of the field of vision. The hunter pressed all the magical flow and waited quietly for the emperor to enter the interception zone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrain of the interception area is not very complicated, except for the Royal Mile as the main road, and several other commercial roads that are enough for the carriage to pass. The three or five groups of knights confirmed the safety ahead and exchanged "safe" signals with the Pegasus Knights who returned to the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunter completed all the preparations and waited quietly. A bit boring, she took a look at this Romance novel. The novels of the Age of Enlightenment have a different taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire’s striker walked into her interception circle at a mechanical pace. The pace is neat and well trained. The middle road is the fastest, and the middle right wing seems to have a magician who has doubts about the gathering of nearby magic. After the investigation, the troops are allowed to move forward. The speed of the four-way army is not the same. The distance between them is only allowed to let each other's scouts say hello to each other for a few kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer Locke is not cool. The hunter was wearing a swimsuit, lying on an unfolded recliner, applying sunscreen to his body, and the military uniforms were stacked on the back of a Pegasus. She yawned happily, enjoying the sun bath and feeling the flow of natural wind. Two summoned forest goblins are dancing on the small table next to them, and they are distressed to study how to put the fruit on the sign for the owner to enjoy. Anne in the past would not waste magic like this, but today she doesn't care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can feel the fluctuations in the magic net increase and increase in one round. Enough to support six magic, seven magic, eight magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two-wheeled and four-wheeled carriages dragged heavy supplies and squatted behind the strikers. In order to ensure that the troops can start on time when they encounter the enemy, they dispatched the combat equipment to each squadron at the beginning of the march this morning, leaving only a large amount of materials and fodder in the carriage. Each group protects its own weight, and also to prevent all the supplies from being raided by the Free Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She draped the Intre's red coat and leaped from the edge of the cliff. The sun shines directly from the top of the head, the front of the military uniform is open, and the hem is like a cloak fluttering in the wind, revealing her swimsuit. The blue-brown gemstone is set on the pendant and shines on her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl with blue sunglasses in a soft tone, with one hand on her hips, told the imperial staff who were starting a threatening declaration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said this: "Stop the march. Otherwise you will be destroyed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The generals and colonels who were chatting were staring at her. The colorful military uniform is obviously the Free Army, but no one knows how to open it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, please stop marching, or will you be destroyed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Wait a minute, who are you-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The core of a force is the school's principal and eunuch. So start with you? Sorry! ", please rest in peace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finger helped the sunglasses, and a blue awn on the blue lens, the blue pupil dimmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne’s right index finger turns black and draws a black void line in the air. The huge negative energy is concentrated in the space, and instantly takes away the lives of the people in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"--fingerofdeath?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly and elastic Syllables. That is the most elegant and the least elegant magic. There are too many magicians who like this magic, and too many magicians hate this magic. Pure power competition, the strong is born, the weak is dead. The dead have no pain, they only know that they are under the magic that is much stronger than their own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No art. No wisdom. No screams. No blood. But there is strength and absolute power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone who was hit by the black line was caught in a dream that never awake, no distinction between nobility or civilians. She strolled in the commander's team of the emperor, as if walking in the flower fields surrounded by roses. The movements of the fingers are elegant and neat, and they take away the lives of the school officials one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responding soldiers shot wildly, and the lead bombs were parked in front of her, inlaid on the invisible defense net. Her left hand gently bounces those bullets, just like the dust on the body. She only killed those school officials and captains and intercepted a group of urgent orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Annie is serious, she can see the greatest weakness of the invincible empire's main army. In the months of the Free Army's service, Anne learned the fastest way to crash the command network: killing the executive class, not the general. Everyone can become a general, but there is no way to quickly restore a military corps. What's more, more than half of the magic officers have left the team. She used the simplest violence, but she invested in this violence at the most ingenious point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evil...Devil..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first round of play. Countless attacking magic and bullets slammed on the shield in front of the girl, and could not cause even a trembling. The other party can't stop, can't delay, can't be eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second round of play. The proud officers of the past fled, the nobles discarded their honor, and the civilians abandoned their responsibilities. The timid officer tore off his epaulettes and shivered into a ball, praying that he could escape the robbery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third round of play. The entire middle road has become a mess, the troops stopped moving forward, and the surviving eunuchs and non-commissioned officers reorganized the team and determined the enemy's location. The elites of the First Guards of the Royal Guards lined up as combat squads, and they were in front of a blond girl in a red military uniform. The shooting of the guns is not limited, the magic has a deep pit on the ground, but the opposite magic shield does not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hills behind her are generally unmoving. Anne spent four hours building a temporary magic net, which was not wasted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A strong man...a strong magician. The magic artillery, covered with a cloud bomb!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the court magi, the 48-year-old Victor von Gurik, who was on the shoulders of his squadron, and the equivalent of the deputy commander, Sid Nasse, on the shoulders of the general reserve team. The rank of the military. Victor won the association's approval with a vacuum magic paper twelve years ago, and acquired the current position with related magic. In the next few years, he was named after the Magdeburg experiment, which proved the atmospheric pressure. He is a high-ranking mage known as the actual combat magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there confidence? There are automatic confrontation, damage reduction, energy immunity, and force field defense, at least with my strength."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid arrives faster than most people estimate. The Imperial Security Department’s Supervisory Team is omnipresent and the communication between them is surprisingly fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "More than that, I guess the other person has a unique secret magic, she can use some means to extract the magic to supplement her own loss. With this magic alone into the enemy, With one person's power to disturb our army, the South Army also has such a heroic magician." Court Mage's tone of admiration. However, he immediately remembered the identity of the person around him, and added a sentence: "It is a pity that it is a rebellion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a heroine." Correctively, "I want to find a way to kill her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me think. Unless she destroys her once, her magic will never be used. Young is more than my realm, it is a pity..." Victor hurriedly changed his mouth. "Of course we should not pity the jade. Naser, I want you to defend the enemy against me."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid nodded. Victor narrowed his eyes and observed the other's actions under the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this era, there are very few high-level wizards. Their value is not commensurate with the actual role: as the previous Emperor tried, the concentrated low- and medium-level casters had a higher attack power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, only high-level wizards can fight against high-level wizards. A high-level wizard at a key point can reverse the whole picture, just like now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor’s line of sight through the thick fog, speculates on the route the enemy might choose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"--Vapor bursting (vblast)!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his eyes, The air in the space is emptied for a moment, and another moment is filled, so reciprocating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge air pressure turned into a blast, cutting all the things in the thick fog and the path, including the curse of the thick fog, the body and the finger of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm has blown up. The red military uniform was conspicuous enough to expose the position the other party was trying to transfer. The court magician knows that the young woman's magic must be higher than him. The only thing he can use is the short-lived time when the opponent is not familiar with the vacuum magic performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"--Super Magic Instant - Vacuum Blade (vblade)!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three Ways The vacuum blades that are intermingled together are deadly enough. Victor bet that the opponent's magic shield can't cope with a bit of intensive attack. After the previous bursts, the general mage will judge that the vacuum burst is only to create a range of blasts, using the air pressure difference to split the enemy, so the defensive magic is adjusted to a wide range of full body protection; few people know that vacuum magic also It is possible to skillfully create a continuous vacuum in a plane, so that the air that fills the gap becomes a sharp edge that directly cuts the opponent's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He succeeded. The red figure was almost immediately split into six pieces that were disconnected from each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that’s just military uniform, no one under the military uniform! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All masking!" Sid raised his dynamic vision and judgment to the limit, extending his right hand in front of Victor von Curick, screaming The spell is smashed out, "-shieldofblackdd!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perfect plan often hides the greatest danger. When Victor finally realized this, it was already late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its flight carries amazing wind and penetration. Eighty-one small pure energy flames became a large warhead, concentrated on a point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the clouds are being smashed by this smash; all sights are concentrated on this swift and powerful hit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pure flame not only eliminates all the defensive magic of both the enemy and the enemy, it even invalidates the nearby cannonballs through the magic net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original should be a pure silver flame, slightly stained with a little magical magical color, showing a blue sky that is as transparent as the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor can't see everything in front of him. The safety minister's hand around him was trembling gently, adding the magic of betting on this black diamond shield at a speed that was difficult to trace with the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second layer! The third layer! The fourth layer! The fifth layer! The sixth layer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Who has seen such a hegemonic blow? Shields forged from black diamonds are already the strongest defensive magic of this era, but even this magic can't stop the other party's concentrated and pure magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seven-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid’s right hand pain, no longer feel pain . Or, because the pain is too strong, the pain nerves have already stopped working. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This smash destroys all the magical defenses that Victor and Sid set up, first blasting the right hand of the Security Minister and breaking through the Forehead of the Court Master. ! At a distance of more than 200 meters, which is close to the limit range of the gun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Supervise the team, stabilize the position! Retreat the latter and die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid Immediately realized how much crisis this would cause. He ignored the bloody right wrist and kicked the body that Victor was still standing, covering the body with a black cloak and lying down with himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To block the message. The court mages with the platinum medal were killed in a match at the district. Once this fact is spread, no military officers dare to face this unidentified enemy. Sid knows how much damage this morale will have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain reminded the security minister of a female high-ranking mage and pastor of the enemy, and last time he was forced to flee from the front of the man, leaving A left hand - this time is the right hand. The left hand restored with divine magic has not yet recovered its former dexterity. Luther should be in Blenheim with Lopez, but he can't be sure of this. He stared at the swimsuit girl opposite, and wanted to engrave her looks deep into her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, he noticed the blue gems on Annie's chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone can observe the wonderful expression of the Security Minister at the moment, he will be surprised to say: It is something that will never be used on this person. Adjectives, such as "the gaze of the eyes", "the sweat of the big buckets flow down the forehead", "the trembling of the blue-purple lips", "the teeth bite and squeak". It was the expression of a man who found out that all his calculations had gone wrong and that he was going to face the disaster. He even forgot to suppress the souls that were enslaved by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is impossible. But if that's the case, all the clues are connected. My enemies... you are amazing. But you won't succeed. You won't succeed, Bruto Luther!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid put his hand into his pocket and quietly pulled out a black one. The gems, staring, pressed back the almost out-of-control souls. If Anne can see the gem, she will be surprised to find that the cut of this gem is exactly the same as her own sapphire, only in different colors: transparent sky blue and turbid black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Anne at the moment is unlikely to see this jewel, because her own plans are also going to a critical moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic is strong enough to have recoil, and the recoil is so big that she is so flat that she falls to the ground and her shoulders are off. Anne endured severe pain and restored her shoulders in place, soothing the shoulder pain caused by releasing all the magic once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy did not attack any more, nor even organized defense. No one can accept this kind of blow to kill a valuable high-level wizard. Now, no one will dare to invest in the second high-ranking mage - of course, this situation is what Anne needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Next, the cut-off supply line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is like those in ancient legends Like the great magician, the deliberate use of the most critical and greatest magic in front of the enemy. The fear and panic of the enemy is the good nourishment of this kind of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the narrow valley of Jena, to the intersection of fate; from the choppy river bank to the edge of the mountains -"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sky trembles and trembles, the roaring sound rang through the blue sky, the storm swells across the ground, and the waves smash across the shore! Let the disaster come - lift the magic net!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the network was disconnected, the head was very painful and very painful. Not because the magic net is addictive, but because it is out of touch with the sea of ​​endless knowledge. The feeling is called loneliness, always surrounded by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she must be. A ring buckles a ring and a strike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne Sefer removed his magic and released the power equivalent to dozens of earthquakes in the magic net. Those turbulent forces immediately turned into murderers who destroyed everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application layer crash. Indicates that the layer crashes. The session layer crashed. The transport layer crashed. The network layer crashes. The data layer crashes. The physical layer crashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the scope of the huge magic network that originally contacted everything, the earth shakes and everything changes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky was still clear and cloudless, and suddenly there was a heavy rain, and the earth shook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each locked bridge collapsed, every preset rock fell, and every dam that was stared at was broken. The cracks in each underground have expanded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first step is to destroy the central command, and the second step is to break the tentacles of the enemy's front line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king's river breaks through the levee, and the vast soup is swept over the shore, smashing the center-right team. The four brigades of the left and right wing were cut off by the collapsed surface, and they were not allowed to advance or retreat. The brigade with the fastest speed in the middle of the road was surprised to find that he was trapped in a huge rift of four or five meters wide. The whole king's avenue broke into countless pieces! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A complete disaster, no, it should be a nightmare. The number of direct deaths caused by this attack exceeded one thousand, but this number will rise rapidly because the troops are not replenished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Emperor did not estimate this situation. In ancient wars that were involved in a large number of magicians, climate magic, earthquake magic, plague magic, and even volcanic magic were used. If the main army of the empire has a military corps, they can organize countermeasures against this situation within one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, only one quarter of the people in the military corps can work. Don’t say one day, and three days may not be able to reorganize the offensive. The most optimistic estimate is that the remaining officers will be able to maintain the normal operation of the brigades themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the south of Jena, west of the King River, it is such a vast nightmare! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the offensive cannot stop, absolutely not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bet is too big to retreat; the situation is too bad, so bad that you can't give up. Choose only one: fight for it! War is a one-way street, is it not a battle? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that can act is the far right wing of a brigade with a district, and the far left wing of a brigade with a brigade expeditionary army. These two units are all miscellaneous forces that were not valued, but now they have to take on the main task. The only thing that is fortunate is that there are enough magical forces and artillery on the far left wing - although the artillery's power is suspicious, it is still in the hands of some troublesome people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Princess Dickica did not know that the miscellaneous army in her hand suddenly became the hope of the main army. Her troops will arrive at the outskirts of Jena in the evening and will launch an offensive as planned the next morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
