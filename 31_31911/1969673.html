Fox."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 12th Minister of Security of the Holy Coman Empire, Sid Nass Cold, silently remember the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The current commander-in-chief of the Free Army, the Marshal of the Republic, the chairman of the staff meeting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From him Looking at it here, the terrain slowly becomes higher, and the other party’s huge camp is standing at the height of the undulating slope, close to the rushing king river. The lives of thousands of people are laid on this slope and will always stop between the arrays of the two sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Accumulated in the third free war, promoted to the ninth 'Gunshan' division combat staff. The first free war in the first 'Republic 'The position of the division commander in the division, in the north wing of Kengal, organized the defense with the strength of the two divisions, defeated the 80,000 reinforcements of the three corps of our army, and succeeded the highest rank of the Free Army in the battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not use the empire's habitual "rebels" and "peaceful wars" to remember this person's resume, because that is a legend. Legends don't have to care about how opponents comment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And that is his flag, the flag of freedom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the far of the line of sight is The flag of freedom is covered with a banner of bullet holes and debris. There is a saying that the number of bullet holes in the free flag is the same as the total number of autonomous states in the republics. Below the banner is Conti Fox and his army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid takes a step forward, with serious and full of respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a great general, you are the maker of adversity at the moment, you are the challenge we will face."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He whispered the dogma of the first Minister of the Royal Security Ministry: "Since the establishment of the Royal Security Ministry, we have been fighting in adversity. We never shy away from adversity, because avoidance can never solve the problem. We will only believe in ourselves forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army of the emperor separated from it, revealing a path for their officers to advance. The soldiers of the Fegota Brigade watched him and raised the military ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed his finger at the flag and ordered, "Maggie, tell me the distance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost of the green hair witch completed the calculation indifferently and lost the answer: "450 meters. Six times to transmit magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forty-five meters," Sid's left index finger raised. "Okay, keep up with me. Then, for the first time, transfer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He took the first step and this step crossed a long distance. Maggie used a solid arm to hook Sid's neck and calculate the speed, distance and direction in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three hundred and seventy meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind that is invisible to the naked eye fills the original position of Sid, and his body appears in a corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was once the battlefield of the imperial array and the end of the free army’s shooting. The bodies of the soldiers of the two armies have begun to stiffen and form a series of irregular lines. He can hear the snoring of the seriously wounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second time, transfer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second step, there are two hundred Ninety meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several temporary small groups of fighters tried to resist, and they fought against the chasing cavalry of the Warlord. Sid looked at the forefront of the Free Army: some small-scale moves, it seems that some people have noticed this conspicuous intruder, but not many. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third time, transmission."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two hundred and twenty meters. This distance is the longest range of the fire rifle, and only a few magic guarded guns can accurately hit the opponent at this distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he did not let the wind naturally fill the vacuum left after his disappearance. The air pressure overlaps, and a huge roar sounds like a thunder and lightning passing through the low sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is for Victor von Gurik." Maggie asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if it is." The Security Minister replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senior mage who had just died in the South Line found the existence of a vacuum, thus restoring the "ancient" version of the transfer magic. Simply removing the exchange air from the spell to fill the original location will turn the nearby air into a rapid turbulence. Sid is using this magic now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the enemy’s officers can no longer ignore such obvious signs. In their perception, this is obviously a precursor to a large-scale attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sergeants of the platoons screamed, the bagpipes and whistles in their ranks rang: "All have! Bounce, aim, but don't launch !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sid ignored them, just continued to take the unshakable pace. He didn't seem to be walking on the battlefield of the corpse, but it was like walking in the courtyard of the security department building. It's a place that can't be said to be good, but for members of the security department, it's a safe environment to relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fourth time, transmission."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the transmission distance is much shorter, still There are 180 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;still vacuum, still thunderous noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows who was the first to be shocked by the thunder, and slammed the first bullet; but as long as there is the first hair, There is a second third round. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a flash, almost all of them ignored the officer’s drink and shot the rifle in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first wave of guns, so it sounded like a command without a command! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Nature, has no effect. As the Minister of Security, Sid is familiar with the farthest range of each other's various types of firearms. This distance is naturally estimated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggie has provided new information in a timely manner: "At least two people who arbitrarily fired on the Freedom Front were shot by officers."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid sighed and judged that the unit had a poor training level and took the next step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fifth time, transfer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid adjusts the transfer magic to "extended range" In the state, the entire effective shooting area is directly crossed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the roar, there are still seventy meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the center of the enemy array, all the magic is ready, and all the bullets are on. He raised his right arm, the tip of the magic wand spurted out the flames, the Freedom Army soldiers exclaimed, and the queue was a little messy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sixth time, transmission. The seventh time, transmission. The eighth time, transmission."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Continuous roar, one after the other. The three transfer positions are in the gap of the other's array, and his appearance immediately enlarges these gaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of non-commissioned officers in this unit is obviously insufficient. They cannot control the reflective shooting and queue confusion of their soldiers. Too many ammunition and magic weapons are wasted. The roaring vacuum turbulence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gap in the Free Army queue has been terrible: now any assault of a cavalry or an assault of an infantry can bring this unit into two segments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Last time, transfer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will all volley, volley and free shots After being thrown into the brain, all the magic, the magic and the triggering magic are forgotten, and all the chaotic enemy and the friendly forces waiting for the attack are left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Security Minister took the final step. His stop motion is like a real soldier. The sleek and sturdy steps, the heels hit each other and stand in front of the flag of freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zero meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, Freedom does not have a command, but a flat land that has been cleaned very cleanly, with few guards nearby; only one The young commander’s badge was dazzling and stood in the middle of the flat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young officer is shouting loudly to restore the order around him, even if he sees Sid’s arrival, he has not taken out the weapon - although he carries it around his waist A black revolver that looks like a good power is enough to suppress the collapse of the entire front. After the officers finished all the orders and sent all the commanders out, they turned their heads and faced each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid nodded and praised. He did not immediately start, but bowed politely toward the single-handed standard-bearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he raised the question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that Conti? Lord Fox is not here. Is this unit your command?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He doesn't care if he can get the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to hearing the problem? Soledon took a deep breath and adjusted his mind. As long as he is calm, he believes that he not only has the opportunity to live, but also has the opportunity to drag more time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While serving as a combat staff member, he read all the information accumulated by the staff. He knows who the man is in front of him and knows his style of combat. The Royal Security Department has always had a heroic tradition of never evading and taking all the responsibilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, Lord Fox is still behind. This unit is my commander - but before that, you have to introduce yourself to be a gentleman. Etiquette? We are not barbarians."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, Sid smiled: "The 12th Minister of Security of the Holy Coman Empire, Greek De Nass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man on the opposite side breathes slightly, but then resumes normal: "Sure enough. What is your advice from the Minister? What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain’s command is a glance, arrays and tactics are nothing surprising, but the courage and style of speaking is very interesting. The security minister also wanted to talk to the hostile young man. He crossed his arms in front of him and tapped the root of the metal staff with the only remaining hand. He continued to ask: "The Free Army could have taken the name From the banner of the chief, I really didn’t expect it. This time it’s my duty to implement the military rules for you. Your name is, Captain?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Resistance to the door. Captain Gate? Solerton captain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now for every minute of drag, the troops will take one more minute to restore order time - Naimen I’m nervous about the countermeasures. “I’m sorry, as a free country, we don’t stick to the difference in identity like you. You certainly can’t think of our style of action.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No, no, I said that I didn't expect your officers to be so bad, so that Conti? Fox would agree to give the Marshal a military officer of your class." Sid shook his head. A pinpoint pointed out that the weakness of the Free Army is where "the act of launching the Marshal flag is not to be seen." There are some blunders, but it is actually the most effective way to stabilize your position. If you lower the flag now, you will probably collapse the whole army. Do you still have enough veterans?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door that was directly identified by the other side of the weakness was stepped back and opened his mouth, but did not know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid glanced at the enemy array: there was still a long time for the reorganization, and the gap was still so big. He has a well-thought-out: no matter how young the young man struggles to reorganize his troops, all efforts will be lost when the flag falls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he appreciates this kind of person who dares to be responsible and not afraid of death: Sid Nath is also a man who has risen from the bottom of society and he even rises No aristocrats are. He seems to have seen his own shadow in the young man with a slight trembling in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was taken a deep breath and he knew that time was coming. The two cannot possibly go on like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Suspend, let me think about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Security Minister’s right arm is swinging back, so I’m going to The ground began to prepare for the final blow of the battle. "Give you another minute to consider."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Royal Security Department, seems to be a person who never retreats The organization of the composition." Naimeng loosened the hand holding the flagpole and smirked and bargained. "I am always facing too many enemies that are stronger than me. If I surrender, is there a chance to get a higher rank?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing his bargaining time, Sid suddenly came to the interest: "We have always been fair. If you take Jena to Lenny's transfer point Give it to us and I will agree to your terms."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is sucking a sigh of relief. As a combat staff member, he did know that there was a small set of transfer points from Jenathan to Lennie City - but how did the other party know that he knew it? The only explanation is that when the other party heard his self-reported name "Nermen? Soledon", he already understood his resume... What kind of intelligence and memory does the Royal Security Department have? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can give it a try, but there are still a thousand soldiers, there are more than 10,000 defenders in the military camp-"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid sighed slightly: he understood the idea of ​​the captain. If the "bell" is still there, he can choose to protect his soul, but now he can't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Security quietly lifted the arm inlaid with the staff, and also guarded against the counterattack of the officer. If you are so young, you can be a captain. He must be a magic officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not guess wrong. Almost as he was preparing to fire, Nami Soleton’s right foot was heavily on the ground, and a well-covered pit appeared behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"- So you should know that this will not be your own war. Never."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;?&nbsp;&nbsp; While Sid has not responded, he is lying, the whole person has rolled into the pit, do not forget to leave the last sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good luck, Mr. Minister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His right hand is going all out, recording The magic bracelet of the good command was dropped in the air. The bracelet bursts with a dazzling yellow glow, accompanied by a brief and loud command--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All firepower, aiming, firing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid's flame vertices are shot from the wand, and they pass through the air in front of his eyes, turning the magical bracelet into ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the right hand of the door was also affected by this flame, although it was only two fingers, but the pain of these two fingers still made him snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he still grinned his teeth: he got the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Sid is going back now, he can see all the twelve pipe organ guns hidden in the military array, and the 480 guns they own. tube! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These cumbersome weapons intensively discharge a large number of barrels together on a huge shelf, weighing more than one ton. Considering that it can only provide a firepower advantage of no more than thirty seconds on the battlefield, it is impossible for the firearms forces to rely on this experimental weapon as the main force - but than the firepower density, an organ can be better than a gun. The infantry of the company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those chaotic lines happened to be the best cover for his mobilization: the dense formations were quietly dispersed, and the firing line was fired for the organ. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullets poured like a storm. The organ screams and screams, tearing the atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the barrels fired together, and the barrage of the shot immediately enveloped the entire empty field where the flag was! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Sid-Nasser did not look back, only his hat was hit by a lead shot and flew into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Security Minister squatted down on one leg, deployed a defensive shield behind his back, and pointed the staff on the right arm into the foxhole, the upper arm muscles, The magic on the stick continues to pour out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, he was surprised to find that the captain was not prepared for a foxhole, but a whole trench covered with phantom magic. The speed at which the young officer fled quickly made him straightforward and admired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is almost always used by both hands and feet, and even fleeing along the trenches escaped Sid’s attack range. In the face of the magic of a super-high-ranking mage with at least a fine gold badge, his chances of surviving in the first full-attack spell are only one-twentieth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid didn’t say anything, but the female ghost Maggie of his side screamed and laughed: “He wears a full military rank identifier. Was it not afraid of death, but was already ready for a full set of escape plans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will not be chasing him." Sid replied Regardless of the huge thrust behind it, "I just need to be free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kinetic energy of the shotgun bullets shook his protective magic. From time to time, a lead bullet broke through the shield, and squatted on his military uniform, but it fell like a metal plate, leaving only a small pit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Security Minister took a few steps forward through this thrust bow and extended the remaining hand to grab the flagpole of the Freedom Flag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, from the shadow cast by the flag, a glimmer of light glowed into his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid’s first reaction was that it was the sunlight cast from the man-made bullet holes on the Freedom Flag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sun won't be so bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Army’s new weapon is not limited to the organ, but the Freedom Army also has an organ called “The Dragon Squad”! It is said that even Lianlong can kill and even the artillery positions can suppress things. It is naturally easy to beat people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the time of the strong operation of the team, the huge magic group is in the air, like a bubble floating in the air -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful iridescent soap bubble now bursts with the music of the change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid did not think about how to deal with the terrible magic group. He has been preparing several mirror magics, ready to fight for time when he is locked by music; but he did not expect that the opponent's magic is not aimed at him, but aimed at the freedom flag itself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as someone approaches the Freedom Flag at all costs, you let go of the control of all the magic and pour it toward the Freedom Flag."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is so easy to tell Meity that controls the organ. From the beginning, he did not think about keeping the flag of freedom. From the beginning, he asked for this thing just to get a suitable bait, a bait that would not be suspected by the other party. Although he is not a magical genius, he is an out-and-out genius in mobilizing all kinds of resources available at hand to set traps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The free flag burns and all the beams that ignite it carry the melody of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rainbow-colored magic beam passes directly through the flag itself, and goes straight to the Sid Nass along the flagpole. All the protective magic on the Security Minister was concentrated behind him, without any precaution in front of him, and the induced mirroring was ineffective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notes are like a gust of wind. The magic of the organ trembles, vibrating the light and shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire staff inlaid on his right arm illuminates the dazzling blue light, and all the magic stones and circuits on the top burst one by one, and finally the staff itself is broken into ash. The muscles on the right arm were torn again, and the blood flowed down the broken arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless mirrors greeted the rainbow, and each avatar collided with a magical beam of light and annihilated each other. Each of Sid's phantoms can only hold one or two beams, but it has won time for his next move. The exchange of magic is more painful than his heart: each of these mirrors should have been able to induce at least a dozen rainbow beams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this opportunity, Sid sang the flight at the fastest speed, ready to make an endeavor to the flag that became more broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first round of shooting behind it is over, and the huge momentum suddenly disappears. Sid did not hesitate to transfer all the magic shields to the front to block the rainbow beam on the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the door has been calculating, this is the moment when all the opponent's magic is used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do it, Annie 2!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fled his head in the tunnel , while issuing orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incarnation of the devil responded to the sound, she had long been waiting in the tunnel to liberate her all abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slender nails became the claws of the devil, and these sharp objects stretched out from the index finger, middle finger and ring finger of her hands, just like six thin swords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of beautiful legs broke out of the jumping ability that is never human, so that this beautiful figure goes straight into the air. Six black wings smashed the military uniform behind the back, and leaped to a higher height than Sid under the flying magic blessing - and stayed behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Sid turned back. He looked at the woman in front of him, and the flashes in his pupil were "surprised" and "incomprehensible." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon summoned by Anne did not give him time to react, nor did he say anything nonsense, but he did not hesitate to cross the claws belonging to the avatar. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the avatars disappeared like bubbles under this multiple attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid Nass was flung out by this blow, and his body under the influence of flying magic seemed to have no weight. The honorable body of the Security Minister slid down, leaving a deep mark on the ground and rolling into the last ditch at the foot of the outer wall of the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More rainbow beams chased the body, and the avatars did not hesitate to rush to the trench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene silences everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the position of the emperor, this silence is full of indescribable repression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheduled wave of the attack is ready, but no one is moving forward. The order they got was "to launch an attack when the flag of freedom fell" -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fearful security minister was in front of such a small unit Was not known to life and death, and the broken free flag still proudly hung there! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t even notice that the commander of the Liberal Army’s strong operations was crawling out of the trench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I don't know if Sid is dead or fleeing...but we are successful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Sorryton captained himself and made sure he was not dreaming. Really not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next order, he had already prepared it in his mind several times while conceiving the plan - but he never thought that there was a chance to take this Say it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone, we have defeated Sid-Nasser! We have defeated the Security Minister!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Answering him is a cheer like a sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
