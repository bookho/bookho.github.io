			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central plateau from Kyzyl to Voltkagrad is a secondary ramp that wanders between the hills of the plateau. The condition of this hilly road is not as good as that of the royal avenue from Kengal to Lenny, and there are few villages and towns along the road. After leaving the farming area around Kengler, it is a winding mountain road. You can see the valley except the hillside. From one stop to the next, it is often necessary to run for an hour or more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander of the Central Army of the Free Army and the second "Intre" of the main force, a total of 18,000 people, seven full-scale combat groups follow this The military station on the road unfolds and is deployed in a huge area of ​​150 kilometers - this is to facilitate the supply. After all, in the central plateau where crops can only mature once a year, it is necessary to raise a large range of agricultural land in the early spring. Under the guise of logistics, the resident of the Intermediary Predecessor was set up in a small town only 50 kilometers from Kengal. If Kengal changes, the group will be able to reach the city of Kengal in one day, and the entire division will only take five days. In contrast, the nearest Imperial reinforcements to Kengal are in Newcastle, 500 kilometers away. It takes more than two weeks to join the battle at full speed - this has not yet calculated more than 20,000 Freedom Forces in Ambolas and Steelburg. The interference of the soldiers. As long as the Central Military Staff received the news from Kengler, even if the Emperor annihilated the warrior, it would not be possible to stay in the city in the enemy's hinterland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no obstruction on this road, and it is too strange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At midnight, when most people have fallen asleep, Bonnie, who still uses the "Pluto" status, is looking at the starlight at the end of the valley four or five kilometers away on horseback. If she is not mistaken, it should be the sphere of influence of the Central Army from this fourth town. Each of the first three towns was stationed with a platoon of the emperor and a squad of the government, and there were reinforcements, but unexpectedly she did not receive any interception. But now she doesn't have much time to hesitate: as long as the Intercontinent is out for an hour, the security of the warrior is a guarantee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Bonnie used a magic to speed up the mount and flew to the end of the valley. Soon, she saw the Freedom Guards at the mouth of the town, and the "Red Sea", a flag of the red wavy line. Her horse was shocked by two sentinels in red coats, and they hurriedly stopped in front of the level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop, who?? Why are you going late at night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kingle General Election There was change, the emperor ** force interfered, and the warrior defeated!" Bonnie gasped and shouted to them loudly, "I am the vice-president of the Federal Party, Bruto; Luther, and the Freedom Army remnant from the city. Escaped from here! We urgently need reinforcements!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shouting alarmed all the sentinels nearby, and the entire guard class came together. Someone recognized him and exclaimed: "It is indeed Pluto; Luther! I met him at the auxiliary meeting of Voltkagrad! Go and inform the Chief!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sergeant arrived soon, this is a sergeant platoon leader. He immediately told his men to take the very tired horse to the stables, and he was very respectful to bring Luther to their company. The company was set up in a two-story building not far away. There were almost no one in the middle of the night, only two sleeping guards and two duty rooms illuminated by a buttery lamp. She followed the platoon to climb the second floor, and the secret communication of her sister came from her ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"--There has been repelled the Emperor ** - Killing a cardinal one - the future situation is unknown - white rose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this news, Bonnie almost sneered out. "Red Cardinal? Is this too gorgeous?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering the possible consequences of killing the Cardinal, the office is here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come, Lord Luther."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sergeant opened the door for her, Bonnie Put away the smile on his face and walked in. Inside, a young officer wearing glasses and looking very capable was smiling and staring at her. His smile is quite attractive and somewhat familiar--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a sudden full of needle-filled drugs entering the blood vessels, an indescribable excitement and paralysis along the nerve endings Rush to the brain. The reason on her face disappeared without a trace, her eyes became sluggish, and even "something is wrong" could not be reflected. The sergeant at the door stared at it with a smile, and the smile looked like no mind. The perfect trap is set after the target is relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been waiting for you to wait all night. I thought the Federal Party's think tank, the only senior priest of the Protestant Church would be very difficult to deal with. As long as I knew this, I wouldn't have to risk such a big deal against Machiavelli. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who appeared as a politician secretary during the day took his glasses and took the door. His words are very rhythmic - two syllables in one second. no more, no less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, the vice-president of the Federal Party, let me know some information first. After that, become part of my strength."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The painful struggle. Emphasis on lucidity in my mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a trace of the mind to judge the identity of the person in front of him. Luther spit out the terror-stricken name: "His...Sid..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you still try to struggle? Senior pastor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Imperial Security Minister made another snap. In the darkness beside, a flame flashed a little, and a more powerful mental control hit Bruto. He trembled all over, his head lowered and he stopped all resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you start answering my question?" Sid; Naser raised a finger and swayed in front of the captive's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the temporary interrogation room under the dim oil lamp, disguised as a male Pluto; Luther’s Bonnie; Sefer sat in a chair, stupid Stupidly smiled and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame of the oil lamp is reflected in her pupil, swinging. It is somewhat unclear to say that this is because the trialee has no psychological defense at all and can only answer the question of the interrogator mechanically. What she lost was not only the freedom of the ** but also the freedom of the soul. After the great Machiavelli, the cruel torture confession has become a trace in the history books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clear part of his mind is only obedient, and a little bit of distant memory of the enemy in front of him. That memory is just a vague shadow, just like in another world - <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prime Minister" Sid; von; Soma. As a civilian, he climbed the man at the highest point of the empire through a security system. But why does he use spiritual magic...? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even this ambiguous thinking disappeared into the torrent of excitement. In his mind, there is only the willingness to obey the masters of the eyes in front of him. This person in front of him is God, everything. Now, God wants to ask questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Name?" "Pluto; Luther."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Age?" Twenty-seven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Occupation?" "Innovation cleric, banker."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The interrogator Sid cocked his mouth with satisfaction. These basic information is consistent with the information he has mastered and cannot be mistaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who calls himself Pluto; Luther is the most mysterious of the enemies he encounters. Suddenly bankers and high-ranking Protestant pastors also have extraordinary political abilities. As the leader of the secret front of the Coleman Empire, he is accustomed to speculating on all actions from the perspective of conspiracy theories. According to experience, such a person cannot emerge from the air, and there must be a huge group hidden behind him. It’s hard to lay the trap to catch this life, he must be extra cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who sent you here, Mr. Luther?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid will The oil lamp moved closer to Luther's face, a little more pressure. The first thing he must be sure of is that this person still has a little self-awareness. Bruto's Zhang Junmei is as painfully distorted as a woman's face, and seems to be fighting the illusion and pleasure she feels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the commander of the Freedom Army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of Security is a glimpse; he did not expect This real first question was cleverly wrapped around. He held his chin around the prisoner for two steps and understood the magical way of using it. Under the influence of "mind control", the other party can not defy his problems, but can use various means to misinterpret his problems. He re-conceived the problem and began to get closer to what he wanted from the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Emperor attacked us... Our people repelled them. We killed a cardinal and urgently needed reinforcements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Cardinal? Sid gently repeated this unexpected news, his face still unchanged. "So, who brought you to Kengal to participate in the election?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Myself. Because, can't let Kengal vote for the empire." The lips trembled and spit out the answer. This answer is still nonsense and nothing is disclosed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that this can't be asked, change the question." Sid said to himself, walking behind Bruto. “How many priests are you or stronger than you in the Innovation Conference? Who are they?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer is greatly out of De's unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No one." Luther muttered to himself, "Now there is no one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No one. Is it that you are the strongest? How is this possible..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid suddenly felt something was wrong. He frowned, stopped, and slammed Luther's shoulder from behind the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Luther, don't act again. Actually, you are not affected by domination, right? If you really don't work with us, I The magic in my hand is about to be released. I don't want to use any punishment at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pearto’s breathing suddenly became heard by Sid’s scams. In a hurry, the pupil was enlarged and the whole body shivered. Sid was alert and did not hesitate to put the torture magic of torture on his hands with his hands, in case the other party was really disguised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indescribably tortuous through the nerve endings. The vice-president of the Federal Party screamed and rolled down from his chair, holding his head in his hands and huddled in the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard at the door guard looked at the room with a controlled smile and turned his head again. Sid retreated to the corner and carefully observed the Pilate struggling on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams slowly turned into sputum, and the sorrow slowly turned into a gasp. Bruto was sweating all over his body, and his expression restored his numb smile. In the struggle, his clothes were covered with dust, and his sleeves were ripped off by himself, like a rag on his wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These clothes are high-quality items, but the Minister of Security does not feel a pity. He sighed in disappointment and knew that the person in front of him must have been under his control. For a person who is under the control of the spirit, using the excellent performance of the previous period is just like explaining the sonnet to the ogre without any meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not control the people struggling on the ground, but pulled out a clamshell pocket watch from his coat pocket. He bounced the cover with his thumb and suddenly began to talk to the pocket watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can't I ask? Is there anything wrong with this match? Answer me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Upon hearing this question, Pluto steadily climbed close to him and looked at the person who controlled his mind with a confused look. "I haven't heard it. What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sid ignored him, but continued to face the pocket with the command: "Tell me, Does the dominance never get a lie? Is it absolutely not removed by any outside interference?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The answer to both questions is 'of course 'The person who is subject to control can only refuse to answer at most, but as long as he answers, it must be true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the pocket watch, a glamorous Proud female voice. Upon hearing this sound, Bruto, who was kneeling on the ground, suddenly became stiff, like a fierce spiritual blow. If Nikolay is present, he will recognize the voice - that is, Maggie, who has been missing for three months; the voice of Veri. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? Can't you ask? Do you want me to ask you? This magic will greatly reduce the actual intelligence of the target. OK." The woman's voice is mocked and disdainful. "Or, you can change your magic. It is directly connected to his heart, so although it is potentially dangerous, it must be effective."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female voice converges a little and swears: "Let me get close to him, you have to keep an eye on his eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand." Sid On the pocket watch, I read a paragraph to make my mind become a blank spell. After completing the protection, he grabbed the stiffened Bruto's collar with his other hand, put him back in the chair, stared at his eyes and reopened the pocket watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let the mind connect with each other through its window, so that the words can't convey the memory fusion...mind link!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggie makes a complete spell with a high voice. The pupils and pupils reflect each other, just like the mirrors facing each other, reflecting countless shadows. Numerous shadows are like bridges that connect the mind and memory of both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real world around is only the shadow, Pluto; Luther’s memory world is gradually emerging. Maggie; Veri is just a wandering fire floating in the corner of this spiritual world - in order to prevent her from doing something unexpected, Sid took her mind into the corner. Sid’s consciousness spreads out and finds what he wants in his memory of captives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be a plain past. The hometown is a ruined city that has been war-torn. It grew up in a family abandoned by its parents. There is a sister who lives with each other. In a poor boyhood, a group of strangers and unidentified people learn magic and theology. His sister met a mixed-man man and fell into the dust, which made Pluto; Luther set a great ambition to build a dignity and rights even for women who are poor and have nothing, a person will not be war A threatening society. So he worked hard to learn political science and economics, became a businessman, a banker, and seized the opportunity to establish his own political power when the South faced this political crisis...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sid; Nasser's mind is reading thousands of paragraphs of memory at the same time, each scene is vivid, and some are simply in tears. But there is nothing he wants - it seems that even Luther does not know who his teachers are. The security minister was anxious and searched harder for each other's memories, allowing more memories to appear in his senses and drowning the real world around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a standard publicity resume for Southern populist politicians. Is he also designed by others?” Maggie’s consciousness seems to be admiring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same thought has been hovering in the consciousness of the Security Minister himself. Some places are not right. Very wrong. What is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has reduced his search speed. He must have neglected something -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"City. That city! Which city will have both Deland's spire style and the southern grand style? Which one? The large-scale city was destroyed so thoroughly in the last war that it would take more than a decade to recover? Where did he grow up?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A flash of light flashed, and Sid seized something that made him feel wrong, and immediately concentrated his spirit, leaving only the impression of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared at the city, trying to find any emblems in the city that marked the location, but did not find it. There are no markets, no parliaments, no government houses, and there are no buildings in the city that can name them. Only some shops that have not been heard, such as “la” and “necrosoft”, are opened all over the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is this? Tell me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Security Minister stared at the person in front of him. Surrounded by the revival of the real world, Luther in front of the real world and Luther in this memory overlap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." Luther yelled and giggled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inadvertently, Sid sees something that could not have been seen in the real world through the neckline of the other side: black corset underwear, and even below Tighten the chest that is still faint. This is inconsistent with all the information he has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible, he is...female?" The security minister’s will was loose, and the body reflexively grabbed the other collar and asked loudly. "Who are you?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mind quickly retraced, trying to untie the mind and close the pocket watch, but it is already late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the sleeves, it is the ice blade that I don't know when it is quietly formed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colorless and transparent tip of the sword draws a smooth line in the air, and with the whiteness of the forest, it is hard to imagine Bonnie, who has always been calm and cold. Can use such a quick sword trick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know what method I used, she played the role of “controlled Pluto; Luther” and completely passed through Sid. This suspicious opponent, who waited until he took out the pocket watch, shot. If it wasn't for Sid's heart to discover her gender, her first blow would have confidence that the Security Minister and future Prime Minister would disappear from this history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This accurate, rapid, and powerful surprise attack accurately hits Sid’s left wrist with his pocket watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The triggering magic "Stones" on Sid's body started, and his skin was covered with a layer of gray limestone, but not enough to stop this fierce one. hit. The sniper of the ice blade slashed into the depths of the limestone, making a dull sound--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the threat of Bonnie’s extraordinary strength and speed, these limestones Soft like cheese! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wrist was cut off by the ice blade and fell to the ground. The aorta did not bleed because the blood was stopped by the granite skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pocket watch was hit by this blow, flew out of the hand and slammed on the wall behind him. The two men paused at the same time and converted the target to the pocket watch. Sid reached out and grabbed it, but Bonnie's magic started faster than his instinctive reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Estimate the distance, focus on the magic, the girl's left hand and three fingers close together, there is an invisible silk thread from her finger joints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"telekinesis (by the air)!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invisible power volley On the pocket watch, Bonnie pulled back with her left hand and pulled the pocket watch in her direction. The ice blade of her right hand is still pressing hard, trying not to let Sid interfere with her actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cut!" The security minister whispered, and originally went to grab the pocket watch and reached out to the waist to pull out the sword. His swordsmanship is very high and he once won the runner-up in the Free Sword Fighting at Imperial University. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The empire has been short of people and even the minister has to personally devote himself to the assassination?" The connection of the soul is still there, Bonnie is trying to interfere with the Greek De's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let each other." Sid squeezed a refutation from a blank mind, using a short-skinned sword to promptly open Bonnie’s deadly Ice blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sword is very strange: the woman uses the brute force of the big open, completely overwhelming the male opponent in power; the man uses With clever tricks and dials, the girls and the opposite girls, who are only weak in appearance, are evenly matched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that I guessed it. Is that the 'clock'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Her goal turned out to be 'clock'? Why did she know the existence of this thing? Is it even that I will intercept it here and fall into their calculations?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Think of the huge organization behind the woman in front of him, Sid; Nasser is thinking about the countermeasures while parrying her sword. There is also a huge force behind him, but now these forces can't help. He immediately gave priority to everything: the most important thing now is to never let the other party get the "clock"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left arm is the first coordinate and the right arm is the second coordinate. He popped his index finger at the target location, which was carefully calculated. At the junction of the two lines, the crack leading to the outer boundary should sound open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...plane breach!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear this spell, Bonnie’s face was discolored, and she jumped two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that this is one of the most dangerous magic of the pre-industrial era, able to drag everything in the range into a known alien world designated by the caster. For the modern mage who grew up under the barrier of the plane, all the magic involved in the plane is extremely dangerous - except for a few people who specialize in the plane like her sister, the rest are not even capable. Return to this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out that he was playing this idea... rayimplosion (implosing ray)!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her left middle finger and forefinger are pointing to the pocket watch, the most powerful role in destroying magic. The line did not hesitate to hit the "bell" -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment before entering the crack, the pocket watch split into millions of debris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid's face turned into a dead gray. He can only have one clock, and at least one precious license and three months is required to recreate the clock. At this delicate moment, he can't waste three months to reproduce this pocket watch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this your real purpose, Pluto? Very high-minded." The security minister is cold and cold, "I lost today. Although I don't Know your real name, but I won't forget you. I thought that there would be no more women in the world than Ms. Maggie, and now I take back this judgment."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To speak big, go to another world and talk about it. I don't have the interest to chat with the enemy." Bonnie replaced her female voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Same feeling....plane breach!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See each other and use After a haircut crack, Bonnie felt a sense of instinct. She can't judge where to evade this time: With Sid's ability, will she already consider the scope she can escape? She had to choose the safest solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"dimensional anchor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a yellow anchor line in her hand, tight Tightly nailed to the wall to ensure that he can return to the room after being pulled into the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space was torn, and the second time it made a harsh vacuum explosion. The spell of the other party has been completed, where will it start? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is nervously searching for cracks in the dark, ready to withstand the impact of being thrown through the world's cracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no crack in the direct view, and everything is quiet around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She waited nervously for ten seconds before reacting: the crack was not used to attack her - it was used to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pursuit is too late. Ten seconds is enough to use two magics, even if you use only the elementary cracks, you can escape hundreds of meters away; if you use more powerful precision transmission or dimension gates, you can move dozens or even hundreds of kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the mind connection is still there. I don't know why, Sid did not remove this magic, and continued the conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are indeed a very outstanding person, actually created a male identity into the political world, more bold than Maggie. To be honest, I really want to ask you to work with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie didn't mean to cut off this connection. She snickered and began to prepare to track the magic of the soul position. "Is it like 'working together' like Maggie? I don't want to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am serious. Before you saw Maggie, it was her. If you are willing to cooperate with me, you can naturally maintain an independent status."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The condition is really 'excellent'. Besides, you are already a security minister. It’s not difficult to become a prime minister. Why do you have so many people?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responding to her is a moment of silence. "Do you not want to use your own will to change the world? Your memory is forged, but that ideal is not. If you cooperate with me, your ideals can be realized, it is impossible to achieve in the South."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because there are more men who have a voice in it than women. Because of you The citizens are a group of scattered sand. I bet that even in a hundred years, there will not be a female head of state elected by the people in the South. You can only control this in the back, but in the end it will be nothing." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
