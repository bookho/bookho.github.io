I casually said a metaphor to the people around me. The Joint Army Staff is already a behemoth composed of one or two hundred officers and civil servants. The new information and requests accumulated at night will be sent to the headquarters for processing in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The more I move forward, the more the snowball will roll. If I stop now, the snowball will roll down and crush me. If I continue Pushing up, the snowball will get bigger and bigger, sooner or later I will not push it anymore, then roll it down and crush me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; It has been another ten days since Detroit sent troops to the north. It has been nearly two months since the calculation of the fruit state, and it has been more than two months since it was sent out from the phase port. During these two months, the volunteers and state and county forces from the western states of the Taoist countries have been assembled, and they have formed a large army of more than 60,000 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I take the liberty to ask? What is snowball?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is around The man smirked and raised a question, letting the next sigh of the door sigh in the eyes of the blind man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Snowball...the snowball is...you have seen snow, Miss Zhang Da?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, I heard that I heard it, but I have never seen anything in kind, Lord Natsuy Soledon." The answering person deliberately bite the address very seriously, reminding him that he had promised to use a nickname. her name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...Miss Wings." The voice of the door was depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to the fact that several states in the north of the mountain range are not snowing, it is said that most of the country will snow."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big lady of Zhang’s in Hengqu is also taking a quick look at the information he has read and the order of approval, from time to time using her strange oriental soft pen Write the command instructions for the square words with red ink and throw them to the staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Snow... Snow is a kind of soft and soft ice. If it rolls, it will become a sphere." Nana is troubled by his ability to describe his ability. "If your magical magic is similar to Blizzard or climate control, it's easier to demonstrate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, that kind of thing ours Of course, there is no such thing in the Tao. I can't imagine anything that can't be imagined. Even if you copy it from the magic net, it's hard to master the magic. I have seen the popping ice hockey. Is it something similar to that?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi’s mouth is laughing, but the hand is not stopping. The soft brush sweeps out one of the magical rune-like oriental characters on the paper, which means that it will be sent to each The order of the troops was approved. Nana has been able to recognize a few hundred simple characters, but the command to write is far beyond his ability - even if Anne of the Magic Net shows the word in front of his eyes, most of the words he copied and copied incorrectly; It is Zhang Shiyi who gave orders to the 50,000-60,000 Taoist army. On the contrary, Ms. Zhang is literate and fluent in Coyman, and the intelligence given to her by the Free Army does not even require translation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it’s a long way from the big ice hockey. If we still only have thousands of people facing Zhang Futu’s 100,000 troops, that’s the push. Big ice hockey uphill - we should have been crushed to death. Snowballs, it is a bit like ice cream, it is a kind of elf dessert that breaks up the whipped cream and mixes with sugar and crushed ice..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Nami Soleton’s eyes are on the latest information in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the latest information from the Intres Sea and the Qianlong Sea. He immediately transferred it to Zhang Shiyi after reading it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The three surveillance ships have confirmed that the Kutuz fleet has burned the fruit state, and the wind returns to the west to the west." He will send a fleet to recover the fruit. The state, and provides about one battalion of reinforcements to ensure our retreat..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information sent via Magic Net is the Leonard Kikawi Fleet commander. In that catastrophic battle, his fleet finally arrived, and after the Seventh Fleet and the Elf fleet completely lost their command, they turned the tide and successfully forced the Blackman's Coleman fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi took the magical induction paper and uttered the lower part, so that the surrounding staff and staff could hear: "After ten After the rest of the hesitation, the great conqueror Kutuz finally realized that he could not hold the state under the premise of losing the entire large fleet. After burning the Jiawen Fegna for the second time, the wind broke through the fleetless interception. Out of the Sea of ​​Interlake, carrying refugees back to their home country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than one person made a slight sigh. Naimeng shook his head and said something to everyone: "If the elf fleet escapes, it will be better. He has to escape early, we will not be able to advance and retreat here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because on February 14, 1667, that is, the Taiping Religion Ding is not the first five days of the first month, the sergeant Zhang Futu ordered the mobilization of the central bank of the provincial military It is said to be 660,000, and the real collar is 150,000. It has been negotiated by the western states to respond to the cross-channel gangsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the huge snowball they promoted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fifteenth day, the main force of the joint army in the newspaper state was forced to go north again to Puzhou. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-one, the state surrendered to the coalition forces. On the 23rd, Zhang Fu’s main force in the south of the country was crossed over the Ruoshui River in Duzhou, and divided into two roads to the south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the 25th, the Allied Forces finally entered the Puzhou City on the west bank of the Ruoshui River and seized a large amount of grain. At this time, the total strength has exceeded 60,000. The small Puzhou City can't accommodate such a large army. The joint army has set up camps on three sides outside the city, waiting to meet the army of Zhang Futu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you push the snowball up, you realize that it is far larger than the limit you can control. The actions of each step are reasonable and have been recognized by the military, but in the end they have to fight with three or four times their own enemies. If you only count the core units, it may be more than ten times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But even if they retreat early, how can we abandon so many people who are willing to respond to our Northern Expedition?" Zhang Shiyi sighed, "Zhang Futu is doing all the power." After so many years of jihad, I have already let him lose heart in the country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this sigh, Ninmen opened his mouth and seemed to want to What did she say, but she changed her mind. The speed at which he looked at the information began to get faster, and he quickly found a few things he wanted to find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Xiaoye, please take a look at the situation of these rebel leaders. Do you have any people who need to meet us immediately? Basically arrived yesterday. I It is really unclear about the official position and administrative division of your country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me see..." Zhang Shiyi turned over and wrote a few words. After the self-styled militia leader like Grand Marshal and Qu Shuai, his eyes stayed on a prayer post. She blinked and looked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain Sophia! When did the owner of this note arrive in Puzhou?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Zhang Shiyi suddenly stood up and shouted the name of the commander of the 13th Division Task Force. The female pastor officer from the miracle division is in fact in charge of the defense work of the United Army headquarters. She and her company are also used as a general reserve team for the commanders and the entire army because of the high proportion of magic users. Since she also represents the eyes of the great Supervisor, there is no objection to this arrangement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smack of a woman in a green uniform wearing a white clerk's robes stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The one was arrived late last night, so in the last batch. The owner of this letter came with a small guard, we Arrange his camp in the north of the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain Sophia glanced at the door, and the door nodded, and she called to send the soldiers to find the owner of the note. Zhang Shiyi said, "I have to change clothes," and I hurriedly walked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was busy and quickly followed up and asked: "Who is the owner of this note?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Zhang Shiyi looked at the left and right eyes, grabbed the hand of the door, and quickly walked out of the back hall. After waiting for no one around, he whispered: "That is a prayer of all the traitors." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nelmen is also looking for her to say something, but after hearing this new word, I still decided to listen to Zhang Shiyi first: "All rape?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All the traitors ordered Jia Lin Deng to rule the Taiping Taoist country's traitors and priests, which is equivalent to the imperial history of the Eastern Empire or the security minister of the Kirman Empire." Zhang Shiyi Explain, "He is one of the three most accommodating hands of Zhang Futu, and is in the same position as Ma Zhenglu and Lin Wanguang. He rules at least 20,000 troops. So I can't talk about his affairs in front of others, and we can't be in front of everyone. I met him. He probably came with the intention of Zhang Futu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The special envoy of Zhang Futu..."<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, so I hope that you will go with me." Zhang Shiyi replied, "There may be value."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please wait a moment, Miss Wings. Before that, I have something to ask you." Naomi took care of the statement and asked, "There are so many national volunteers coming to hear the news, you are encouraging. Have you planned to force us to go north from the beginning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The always refreshing Zhang Shiyi gave a slight sigh, and asked: "Agitate? You mean Are the notices of persuasion released on the magic net?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More than that. You must also pay attention to the magic net, Miss Xiaoyi, the recent news is not only more than And it is very exaggerated. Now, in the entire country of the peace, every official, magic user and monk seems to regard us as the reappearance of Clade Lopez and Zhang Futu, and the propaganda and exaggerated propaganda almost arrived. Everyone who can reach the magic net."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Resist the door to reflect on the articles he saw following the magic net, many attached to the behind the Tao and magic, clearly reflecting the author's inclination. In those articles, the name Sonone is touted as the unparalleled name of the world, so that Luo Ruide's true biography is for the sake of his own teacher's revenge, and the touting has made him unable to look directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door hesitated for a moment, but still said his opinion: "I don't think this is a bad thing, but it dragged us into a gamble. Stage. If you and Heng Zongzong plan, I at least want to know the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The truth... thank you so much to see me." Zhang Shiyi subconsciously touched The scabbard of the "benevolent" waist, gently sighed and shook his head. "But these rumors are hardly my masterpieces. Unfortunately, the power of the cross channel is not as big as you think, in my father. That generation has ruined too many elites. The young people around me can only manage the militia at most. It is completely impossible to expect them to release news and control people's hearts on such a large scale."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way... Who is it?" Resistance frowned. "I always feel that we seem to fall into someone's plan."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Part of it probably comes down to relying on our general Zhu, he needs big I’m wooing my allies. Is there another part... I guess that’s an undercurrent against Zhang’s jihad policy. It’s a dangerous undercurrent that can incite the Green Bull House. The special envoy we’re going to meet today may prompt. Some of our circumstances. Think about why Zhang Futu wants to take all his money to participate in this gamble?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Because he is also struggling Niufu has no confidence." Naomi whispered to himself, "Like the former Guozhou, the commander who had to use our troops to attack us, he must rule the system with absolute victory. I also believe that we are revenge on behalf of Clade Lopez?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not only does he believe that I actually want to believe." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi glanced at the female captain of the miracle who looked at her and Ninmen not far away, and suddenly hooked the neck of Nanimen with his right hand. The whole person posted it and whispered in his ear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Then she gently printed a kiss on his ear, then hooked his head in the direction of the female captain, released his hand, and turned to go to his room to change clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door stood in the same place, touched the cheek on the right side of his hand for a moment, sighed softly, and then walked to the main hall of the Puzhou bureaucracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sitting in the official residence, The guards carefully brought in the messenger of Zhang Futu. There are no guards in the church - if the person has the ability to perform the assassination, it is useless to have a guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The poor road to the lamp, the yellow towel of the Taiping Taoist country, and the order of the lord of the heavenly sect of the great sage Zhang Fufu to see the two. May the right path with you ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The self-proclaimed poor people first made a simple self-introduction in the Eastern language, and then repeated it again in the Coyman language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from the look of his costume, Nami Soleton couldn’t see which corner of his body seemed to be poor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old monk who claims to be a lamp is looking like a fifteen-year-old, a few white long scorpions floating in the sky, with eyes and gods, infinitely restrained, with A yellow headscarf that is elegant but not eye-catching, the mouth of the slightly raised mouth appears to be deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is different from the brown or even dark brown skin of the local monk of Murrayman. The skin of Mr. Linzizi is the light golden color of pure oriental people. There is no local mixed blood; his accent also carries the unique swaying tone of the Oriental Mandarin, not as fast as the Murrayman native pronunciation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the lamp a slogan? Or is his surname or son?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door whispered to ask Zhang Shiyi, who was standing beside him. In order to "negotiate the advantage", the female channel master of the Hengqu insisted that Naimen sat in the position of the main commander as the commander of the joint army, and she herself stood sideways - although her right hand was close to her right hand. The body of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen felt that the voice he had asked was almost whispered; but even such a weak voice passed to the ear that was deepened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s right for the poor road. You are the young Shunyen, Mr. Soanmen? The name of the young marshal, such as the thunder." The middle-aged oriental Following the Western etiquette, I took off my headscarf and greeted him, and then I went back. "The sorrowful lord is not a Taoist. I may be more accustomed to calling my common name. My common name is Jia, and I can be a lighter."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young Shuai?" Resist the door and frown, pointing out with a tone of trouble. "It seems that there is a translation error. According to our rank, I am only a major." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Luo Ruide is a handsome man. As a disciple who inherits his military uniform and rice bowl, it is naturally a young man. This time, the young marshal is coming all the way. When the soldiers and horses see your flag, they will surrender. The Master is very flustered and angry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party’s answer is somewhat out of his Expected. He thought that the dignitaries of the Taiping Taoist came to the army with their troops, but the attitude of the other party was like a normal monk who came to see them. The Jia Linguang used his dialogue not only in the Coman language, but also in the words he was quite dissatisfied with the incumbent teacher, which made him very surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi obviously has the same feeling. She tried to take over the other's intentions: "Mr. Lin Deng is an expatriate living in my country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The poor road this year eighty and seven, this I have the fame of the former dynasty, I don’t want to eat Huasu, I live in a country where I live, and I practice the practice and the path of naturalization. Because I am familiar with the country, the poor roads have been the governor of the National Day in the past few years, but the test of jihad is very harsh. I didn’t recover the giant deer, but unfortunately.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Day governor?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know The other person's hearing was overwhelming, and the door did not want to disturb Zhang Shiyi, holding the blue soul stone inside the pocket of his own bag, and whispering to Anne's memory to ask the meaning of this new noun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Governor of Li Tian is the governor of Li Tianfu. He was founded in Zhang Futu. After Zhang Futu attacked Nanguangfu, he said that he established a Taoist country in his home country. Determined to rename it Dadu Li Tianfu, and the three empire of the Eastern Empire. The so-called Sanjing refers to the northern capital of Shuntianfu in the northern part of the empire, the central capital of the Imperial dynasty in the middle of the empire, and the southern capital of the empire. The three characters are taken from the motto of "The Heaven is Dead, Huang Tian Dangli" in Taiping Road, in order to show the determination to resist the court of the Huashi regime...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the door was raised again, Miss Zhang Da coughed and turned into a Coman language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because Suo Shaoshuo is not very familiar with our language and does not understand the art of our conversation, I think Mr. Lin Deng, you still directly explain the meaning. Zhang Futu in the end Anything to bring to us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jia Lin Deng’s adult took out a yellow-wood reel and pulled a thin and gentle one from the reel Paper, the right thumb is heavily pressed on the top, and the text is displayed on the paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Zhang Futu said that if you are willing to withdraw from the native of the country, he can not hesitate and provide the conditions for your army to go to Litian to participate in the holy war. If you recover Cheng Tianfu, he agrees that the splitting of the land will seal you in the homeland and rebuild the Hengqu Academy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Nami Soleton can listen The true intentions implied by this seemingly high-sounding condition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unconditional surrender, and then exiled overseas to make a living for the land." He gave a cold cry from his nose, "We still have 60,000 troops -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was paused here. It is not because he knows that there are only three thousand regular troops in the 60,000 army, but that Zhang Shiyi has quietly pinched his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, what I want to listen to is not what Zhang Futu said, but what Jia Linguang wants to say to us. What Zhang Futu wants to say, just find a order." Soldiers or prisoners can say that they don’t have to work for Mr. Jia to come in person.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Zhang’s tone has already brought a touch of sharpness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no eye and eye here, what Mr. said, and will not reach the ears of Zhang Futu. And we have to arrange for Mr. Zhang, Zhang Futu obviously will not Believe that Mr. Jia has anything to ask for, just say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a good feeling for a young general who is only a fraction of his age to be white, old monk For a moment, the subconscious mind looked around – but this action also completely revealed that he was not completely loyal to Zhang Futu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Jia Lin’s lamp hesitated, and the door suddenly remembered the doubts in his heart, and the voice sank and tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are marching in this way, all the way to Puzhou, this is the power of Mr. Lin Deng. Xiaoyi, no matter what the requirements of the gentleman, even In order to repay these help, we should also agree with Mr.'s request. This is in line with the right way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His passage made Zhang Shiyi and Jia Linguang at the same time. Zhang Shiyi was shocked, and Jia Lin’s lamp was a joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Guess it. No wonder he is willing to come alone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is in the heart I thought, decided not to give the other party time to think about countermeasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately stood up, his hands pressed heavily on the front of the case, and the sound echoed in the lobby of the bureaucracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In my heart, Mr. Lin Dengzi is already our friend before coming here; since it is here, it is our most important thing. Allies. If we are lucky enough to defeat Zhang Futu, no matter what you want in the new country, today I can say it by myself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of the fierce tone of the door, Jia Lin’s lamp looked the same, his eyebrows were slightly picked, and he slowly applauded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not a handsome, it’s really not you. This is really what I have arranged for the two states. If the two states don’t vote, your army is afraid. I dare not go north."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be an illusion, but the doorman actually felt that the lanterns in the entire lobby were applauded by the old monks in front of them. The palm of the hand trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, if it wasn’t for Zhang Futu’s reversal for so many years, I would never find a chance to attack my old department. I used to be Xia Guan, Dong Guan, and The governor took the Ryukyu and the Admiral Litian, and saw with his own eyes how the elite of the country was caught in the quagmire of the country’s dynasty. Today, although Zhang Futu has a 150,000 army, its elite is on the other side of the sea, the homeland of Tangshan, but here Just like a chicken and a dog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If Zhang Qushuai and Shaoshuai smashed Zhang Futu in this battle, it is also a good way to return, and the sorcerer is ruined..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door slightly frowned, but Even his action also fell in the eyes of Jia Linguang. He was busy changing his voice: "If Shaoshuai and Zhang Xiaoqu Shuai can take down the Green Bull House, the old man will not be in charge of the world's authority. He only asks for the best of heaven, killing the madman Zhang Futu, ending this. There is no need for jihad, and the court of the old country is negotiating! The old age is not for personal benefit, but for the well-being of the Taoist people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is licking the lips, slightly Looking down, holding the Soulstone in his right hand, he asked Anne's memory for two questions at the fastest speed, and then stared at the old man in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Lin Deng wants to set up Tianfufu?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old monk two white eyebrows As a sword, a slight dagger, shut up without saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this Tiantianfu can stop the truce, it is really possible to attack and retreat, but not to mention the 100,000 troops stationed by Zhang Futu. If Zhang Futu died, we It is also powerless to go to the ocean to take it; it is also a scourge to keep the 100,000 army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that the door seems to be on the spot to promise the request of the Jia Lin, Zhang Shiyiyi Surprised, busy and said: "Resistance, wait a minute..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen Soledon smiled and suddenly extended his left hand and grabbed Zhang Shiyi. The little waist is so strong that she pulls her on her lap. The female channel handsome waist was stiff, her face was red, and she did not resist anything, letting the door of the door walk around her waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the case. If Mr. Lin Deng can help us to kill the traitor Zhang Futu, then Li Tianfu and the state capitals of the country, and negotiations with the home country court In fact, all the commissions were murdered by the sir. No, the rape order is too small, how is the seal of the heavens? If it is the king, it is afraid that the court of the country will have more things, and it will hinder the husband and the great cause."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing these, the doorman continued to make a move to play Zhang Shiyi, while focusing on the reaction of the old monk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jia Lin’s eyes flashed a touch of cold, but the breathing was also rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old age is only for the tens of thousands of people, it is not for the sake of sealing the king..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Naimen immediately guessed what the murder in front of him was worried about. Although there doesn't seem to be any guards and surveillance magic here, after all, the resistance door itself comes from another completely different magic system, perhaps with the unfamiliar surveillance or scene reappearing magic. If the last goal and Zhang Shiyi are defeated, then these will become the crime of Jia Lin Deng, and he will only flee again overseas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are afraid that there are only three of us here, I can make a letter." Resist the door and watch the color, tapping the table with his free right hand," Of course, this word can certainly not be used to count the husband. I will write the agreement in Koman in my name, only to win, then Mr. Feng is the Duke of Litian, and all the holy wars are recovered. Since this agreement is In the Coman language, even if I want to do the anti-countermeasure, or if I am defeated, Zhang Futu has seized this piece of paper, and it will certainly not harm the interests of the gentleman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old The monk did not answer, but the chin moved slightly again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was pushed by the left hand and pushed Zhang Shiyi from his knees. He ordered her to order her maid: "Make the ink!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi glanced at him with a red face and began to grind without any resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door stood up, took a quill from the armed belt, began to write with the oriental ink, and wrote the seal without two. At the end, I left my name and fingerprints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He read a small spell, and the ink-free Koman language book floated in front of Jia Lin’s lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. is about no need to translate magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the rape orders are sharp I looked at the complete text, touched the long sigh, nodded, and whispered two rumors that I didn't know what to do. There was a glimmer of yellow light on the piece of paper, and then flew back to the front of the facade at a much faster speed than before, and rolled it up in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resist the door and pick up the paper roll, put it into the close-fitting material bag, and sit back on the chair of the heavenly chair. Zhang Shiyi is still packing up the ink. He impatiently pulls it, let the beautiful girl who is the commander of hundreds of thousands of people in the cross channel, in this broad daylight, in the state of Zheng Zhengtang, sit back on his lap. Miss Zhang Da snorted again, but still did not resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for Zhang Fu's thief, he can handle it at will. Mr. Lin Deng can still have something today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Jia Lin Deng looked at Zhang Shiyi, looked at the door, and hesitated a moment, finally said: "The young master is a hero, but the big thing is not successful, still not so indulgent. Although, old, you may not I can listen to it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will return to the Master of the Master: Soonenmen’s proposal for the kindness of the Master’s Master is ridiculous, and that’s 'said wing’ Zhang Shiyi Then he laughed and laughed at him, even underestimating the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jia Lin Deng turned his head and left, leaving an intelligence message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition, I think this time, the war has begun." Jia Lin Deng took out a pocket watch and looked down. "I ordered the Puzhou thorn in the west bank of the river." The village of Puxi has left a battalion, and the village is high and deep, able to defend the retreat of the Hengqu army, and intercept the forward route of the West Coast Guards. The commander of the West Coast is the deputy commander of the Guardian Army. I am impatient and self-satisfied with the world's best, and will certainly come to the elite. The young master is going to send people to kill him. It is a farewell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems In order to respond to his words, from the northwest direction of Puzhou City, there were many sounds of artillery roaring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the door changed, pushing a Zhang Shiyi sitting on his lap, stood up and shouted outside the lobby: "Please ask Zhu Zhizhi General Zhu, General Dubri Gohco, General Schlopp Cliffo and officers from various ministries came to the proceedings!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jia Linguang nodded slightly and walked out the door Going to meet with his own entourage, and straight into the river, I can’t see that he is already over 90 years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After he left, Zhang Shiyi resumed normal breathing, approached the door of the door, and said: "This is really an old fox. He is a little They are not optimistic about the prospects of jihad, but they want the land that the country conquered in the holy war, but they are still very afraid of Zhang Futu. He thinks we are better able to deal with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But on both sides..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was raised and was about to continue, but found that Zhang Shiyi’s pace did not stop and he ran into him. It seems that he is going to sit directly on his lap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hurriedly bounced from the chair of the heavenly chair before Miss Zhang Da, and almost wiped her body and flashed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi sat down on the hard wooden board of the Tianshi chair and snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if this old fox is also put together with our young marshals, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Little wing, don't call me that." The door was sideways and shook his head. "I still feel that something is wrong, but I can't say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I don't think he is coming to lie to us. Although this person is not young, his desire for power comes from the bottom of his heart. He must really believe that a young person like you is a good person." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door shook his head and explained: "No, I don't mean that his intentions are not right. I believe that if we gain an advantage, he really wants to sell." His teacher's. What I said is not something else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Additional things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter whether it is the general of the Zhu, or the Jia Lin lamp, they all believe that their interests are far above everything. They are not true. . Jihad against the policy, they just think from the current policy of jihad inside their own interests to get enough of it "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; when Zhang wing sometimes do not know how to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
