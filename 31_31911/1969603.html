			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron cross flag flutters quietly in the morning mist of the winter, flying above all the common things. Around it, five flagpoles and four flags were guarded - the flag belonging to the Soma family has not yet risen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look down on the top of the hill in the center of Dehran, you will have the illusion that you have ruled the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From here to the cold north, there is endless blue water, and white sails float in the world's largest port. In the south of the hills is an endless expanse of plains, with fertile wheat fields extending all the way to the edge of the royal territory. The altitude of the mountain is not high, but it is already standing out from the surrounding plains. There are countless towering towers in Delane, circling around this splendid palace, like countless swords pointing to the sky, symbolizing the power and authority of the empire. The Holy Imperial Palace, with a history of nearly two thousand years, is located on this hill. All the historical dust in the past is quietly lying under the base of the building. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mountain has seen the heroic position of the Emperor Kulas after the victory of the Diramon victory, and the young man who ordered the city to be built here, has seen young people. Arthur; Keman urgent marched on the 7th to attack the miracle of the city of Curacao. This mountain once saw the last emperor Paul of the first dynasty pierced by a sword in the fire; Hugh; the body of Koman, who once saw the resurrection of the second dynasty, Hareley; Hugh; Coman’s remorse in front of the grave of the ancestors. Today, it still quietly witnesses the birth of a new era, witnessing the rise of a new generation of great people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the venerable Emperor of the Empire, standing on the top of the mountain, looked down on the territory he owned - and the territory he still had in name. The cold wind of winter blew his tall, slightly thin body, but he didn't feel cold at all - because the golden magic wand he held in his hand gave him warmth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the magic wand is called "great power." It is a sacred token passed down from generation to generation by the Second Dynasty of the Holy Coman Empire, symbolizing the imperial power of this empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, you are really here again. It’s time for the round table, the ministers have arrived, are you still not going?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slightly hoarse voice rang from behind, and there was deep fatigue. Gustav; Hugh; Coleman turned to face the person, he knew that it was a voice he was very familiar with. Most of his courtiers have served two generations of emperors and a generation of regents, but the court general manager Span; Feng; An Lun's qualifications are more profound. The 70-year-old man once served his grandfather, Leighton the Great. From a very young age, Gustav was familiar with his voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am planning to go back." The emperor replied faintly. "You don't have to remind me to think about it. Today's meeting is very important, I can't be absent." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss always nodded silently, followed the thin and short emperor to the mountain. Those who truly see the emperor will find that he is not as handsome as the head of the gold mark, nor is it as tall as the mighty figure on the statues and portraits. His blond hair is not pure gold like a lion, but a dark yellow with a little black hair. Gustav’s golden cane, called “Power”, gently hit the steps, making a rhythmic “squeaky” sound that covered his tiny right leg – the aftereffect of the bone-bearing magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, this represents the majestic hilltop of the royal family, leaving only the whistling of the cold wind, and the mausoleum of the kings of Koman, who were lying there quietly. . There is only one rubbing temperature, and it remains in front of the tombstone engraved with "Dirstein; Hugh; Coman". In addition to the name on the tombstone, there is no single epitaph - but everyone in Deland knows that the tombstone buried underneath is Gustav's uncle, the predecessor of the Regent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Gustav, this man is like his real father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People say that since the death of Dirstein by hand, Gustav has appeared "the unique imperial power of the emperor." No one knows what the young man in his early twenties was thinking about when he faced the dark, bloody and inexplicable power struggle. This genius and short-lived star, leaving only the endless speculation of future generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Chamber is located in the middle of the palace, just behind the main hall of the castle. The emperor walked quickly through the hall with hundreds of seats and walked into a small door on the side. Behind the humble carved wooden door is the highest administrative resolution of the entire empire. It is called a round table – sometimes called the “cabinet” because of the name of this small hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just arrived at the door of the cabinet, Gustav heard a fierce controversyThe voice is very loud, full of enthusiasm, full of a convincing persuasive powerAmong all his ministers, only one person will go straight and talk without any scorn.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you maintain this situation for three months, or six months?! Prime Minister, are you joking?! It is clear that the troops have been assembled, why? Now you have to stand still? Do you know that the troops that have been in the highest alert state every day need to use up the gold coins in the national treasury? Do you know that the Ministry of Finance has used the budget and national debt for next year for this sudden attack? In order to do all the preparations for this offensive, hire reserve and mercenary units, prepare for logistics, improve road conditions... We have spent seven million gold marks, which is half of the total military budget this year! If a special tax on war is imposed, at the time of next year, the national treasury of our country will have no gold coins! You all talked about war, patriotism, revenge, and approved the adventure plan, and now you are here to talk about peace. If you want to choose peace, please immediately revoke the current state of maximum readiness, stop the complete blockade of the border, and dismiss the employer. Corps and reserve forces ...... "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Chancellor of the Exchequer Morris; Gresham (moris gresham) eloquent, loud refute the views of the Prime MinisterGustav frowned and stepped into the cabinet, hitting the ground with his cane in his hand.This familiar voice immediately made everyone stand up and face the majestic figure.Gustav casually found a chair to sit down and signal everyone to sit down.As usual, four of the fifteen chairs of the round table are empty.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grey Xinqing, please don't worryThe round table has not yet begun, and I don’t know much about your respective proposals and positions.The responsibility of the ministers is to make the best decisions for our country and not to use them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Follow, squatMorris took a deep breath and replied.At this point, his face has become popular with excitement and long speeches.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This adventurer from the southern Republic of the Republic of the United States has a hot temper, only because he was able to enter the empire’s power center because of the appreciation of the former king.Ten years ago, he had strangled the great depreciation of the fourth rebellion after the war. The current official gold medal of the empire is his masterpiece.The last general mobilization made the national treasury costly, and the entire logistics and dispatching system was also in chaos. The finance and internal affairs and logistics ministers were already exhausted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since your Majesty has arrived, we will officially start the meeting."Esau Sagan, who sits next to the emperor, von; the old prime minister of icosvon chilingburg announcedLike the court general manager, this prime minister is also a veteran of the Three Dynasties.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The theme of today’s conference is a growing situation in the SouthEveryone knows very well that the Southern Army has now divided into two major factions, the government forces loyal to the government and the coup leaders who are loyal to the coup leaders. They are facing each other on the Maitebi River.The two armies are evenly matched, but so far have not been intensified into a real civil war.Both the interim government and the rebel leader Marshal Govar have stated that they do not wish to trigger a civil war and hope to resolve the dispute peacefully.Three days ago, we have urgently frozen the ‘Blue Meteor’ program, and now we must decide the next course of action.As Gretchen said, it has been a great damage to the national treasury and a great damage to my team.At this stage, the information we can grasp is quite one-sided and incomplete. Please let Naserqing introduce it."The minister looked at the handsome man who was sitting across from him. The man immediately stood up and opened his thick report."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you only look at the appearance, no one would have thought that this young man with neutral charm would actually be the security minister who controls the entire Empire’s security and intelligence system.Like all those who can be promoted to the position of security minister, Sid; cid nasec is also a tight-lipped person - although he is not dumb, but wants to pick something out of his mouth. It’s harder than going to heaven.Sid, a civilian who graduated from the Imperial University of Magic, has an extraordinary accomplishment in spells such as magic, encryption, and magic. The platinum badge on his chest proves that his magic level is second to none in the entire empire. of<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First, I want to apologize for the lack of our intelligence.Our intelligence network only got the wrong information before the coup, and was not prepared for the rapid intensification of this coup.The earliest information we have is three days ago. Most of the information is vague and untrustworthy. Various gossips confuse our eyes and ears.Under the efforts of the analysts of the Ministry of Security, we can only have an overview of the political situation in the South after such a coup.At present, the statement supports the coup army. There are almost all the garrisons of the Rusher-Northern Military Region. Most local governments in the region have also been coerced by the garrison and declared that they do not recognize the interim government of Lenny.Most of the Republic of Armenia support the interim government, but the seventh division in the southwest is not included.All the garrisons of Faures and Interre support the interim governmentIf you compare the forces, it is about the government army seven to the coup d'état three; but if you have more realistic combat power, you have the elite coup army in the northern military region to have the upper hand.It is difficult to estimate how the situation will develop, but the possibility of a full-scale civil war cannot be ruled out, and the possibility of a peaceful settlement cannot be ruled out.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid quickly flipped through a few pages: "OK.At present, the spiritual leader of the coup army, Radz; Gowar is still in Fort Worth, where he put forward his political reform declaration with the theme of "no civil war", 'compulsory military service', 'reform military system' and ' Implementing equal citizenship'; the center of these reforms should be to expand the number of standing troopsThe interim military superintendent of the coup army was established in Kengal, the industrial economic center of the south, where the interim parliament was formed.They deployed the main force on the front line of the Olas River from the front line of Kungler to Fort Foti and the southern border of China.The government forces were cut into two pieces by their deployment: Wiener; the Fassos Army and Klad, led by Admiral Betsy; the Capital Group Army led by Lieutenant General LopezSince both governments are quite restrained, the current hostile actions between the coup and the government forces are only blocked from each other.The overview is the above, the speech is completed"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Sid’s speech, there is no point in the tendency to "war" or "and"As the security minister sat back in his seat, the exchange of eye and mind communication magic began immediately between the attendees of the round table, apparently in the development of a strategy to persuade the emperorHis young Emperor was annoyed to watch his most trusted courtiers as intriguing as usual, but he also knew that at least some of the stupid decisions could be avoided and the status could be stabilized.Since the establishment of the Second Dynasty, there has never been a disaster in the end of the first dynasty, "the nobility threatening the central government" or "the Guardian generals replaced the emperor without authorization." This is inseparable from the establishment of the round table.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a lot of love, please come up with your suggestions.Just from you, ChalinburgGustav said<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister stood up with his hands on the table and his legs trembled slightly; upon seeing, Gustav hurriedly let him sit down and speak.The old prime minister coughed twice and cleared his throat before he opened his mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In my opinion, we should postpone or cancel this military action and focus on the countermeasures.His Majesty's Southern Assault Plan is too wishful, and it is unwise to raise the alert at the moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody thought that the prime minister, who has always been known for his cautiousness, would be so active in direct opposition to the raid that the emperor had promoted. Blue Meteor Program<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Prime Minister, I think your speech is too stupid... No, it’s too illogical! Before we faced all the South The army; now, even in the worst case, we only have to face half of the South ArmyWhy do you think that we should instead take the opportunity to levy? Do we want us to wait until the two armies in the south have reached a compromise, reorganized the government, and established a new order before attacking them? Recently, the elves are in the midst of a colonial war in Nanxinzhou. This is the best chance that the gods have given us, and we will re-liberate the south! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister of Ekasakone squinted at the tall man who stood up and took the table, that was the emperor’s foreign minister, Ke Wei; Eagle wing (corway soe eagle<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This actual age is older than Sid; Nass, the tallest count is one of the most trusted vassals of His Majesty the Emperor, the Eagle Wing in Diramon The county has a rather fertile territory, and has gained its status as a result of the previous regent’s civil strife.Ke Wei himself has a very noble blood of the royal branch. His wife is the daughter of the Duke of Canni, and his eloquence is very good. As a foreign minister, he is doing his best. Dealing with the relationship between the royal family and the nobility can be said to be easy.In the round table, he and Morris; Gresham is the two biggest people in Tuen Mun; if Gresham has persuasiveness based on data, then Hugh; Earl of Eagle Wing has a slogan based on Power<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it’s also a young man who has never seen the tragic situation of the last war... The Prime Minister is somewhat melancholy thinkingHe still remembers that the fourth war was under the city of Lenni, and the emperor was attacked by the southern volunteers who were not afraid of death.It was not a war, but a unilateral killing; but under the fighting of these civilian soldiers, the emperor had never been able to attack Lenny.Eventually, as the two wings were broken, the Emperor retreated to Steelburg, where the Emperor Leostein died from the bombardment of giant artillery...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ekau Sagan no longer wants to use the empire's full of knightly professional troops to fight a militant superintendent government militia, which is unhonorable and uneconomical.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I support the views of the Prime Minister"When the Prime Minister was silent because of his memories, the military minister and Duke of Fegota, Loren; von; Fergota (Lorlain von f spoke in solidarity. "From a military point of view, before we launched a raid, it was strategically sudden." But now, we have completely lost this advantageThere is no doubt that whether it is loyal to Raddz; the southern army of Gowar, or the southern army loyal to the elected government, will be extremely vigilant against our attacks.Now, even the fool can think that we will attack the situation - in this case, we will definitely hit the iron plate and completely lose the strategic suddenness.War is not taken for granted, nor is it a barbaric struggle by spiritual strength or power, but a science full of computing and creative art.No plans, no calculations, no intelligence, purely relying on tricks and fines will not win the war.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since he spoke, the emperor had to give up the solution of force: "Well, we give up the force and take diplomatic approach first. However, the Southern Forces alert level cannot be relaxed..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Your Majesty, if you do not lower the alert level, we will increase the financial pressure of 15,000 gold marks every day." Gracies, who is straightforward, stood up and reported. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor hesitated and changed his mind: "So, we will lower the alert level to the second level, let the second-line troops return to their own premises, and the first-line troops will stay in Frontline."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is 8,300 extra expenses per day...but it is acceptable." The Chancellor of the Treasury frowned and sat back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the financial pass, Gustav breathed a sigh of relief and continued to ask: "As for the foreign policy of the South, my basic idea is to pull one side. , hit one side. Ying Yiqing, by you, which side of the two parties are more likely to cooperate with us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Kewei I was asked all of a sudden, and I couldn’t answer it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the safety minister of the side, Sid, solved the problem for him: "The current situation, I am afraid that both sides are unlikely to cooperate with us. After all, we are heavy The news of the pressure is unlikely to completely bypass the intelligence network in the South; my men must also have the eyes and ears of the South. If you want to pull one party and fight one party, the most urgent task is to intensify the contradiction between the two parties."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is also necessary to send special envoys to both sides to express the goodwill of the empire and the limited support promise. The special envoy must be an oral ambassador who can represent the empire, Don't let the other party know. If possible, try to create public opinion and friction, and destroy the relationship between the two sides.” The Prime Minister added that he would look to the court magician and the court archbishop who had always said nothing in the past. “I I think, you can find a suitable person from the association and the Holy See, and you must have a strong and strong person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem, I will inform the Holy See Find the right person "The middle-aged female pastor Ingrid, wearing a yellow archbishop robe, replied, "Mr. Victor will also inform the association. But if you want to be noble and resilience, you may still have some difficulties..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor wearing a platinum badge on his chest also nodded and said her approval. The pastors and mages who are here represent the two powerful forces of the association and the Holy See, and must not arbitrarily make promises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are a few people with strong abilities and strong abilities, but I have a few people, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;? Sid; Naser said half, and quietly cast his eyes on the military minister, the Duke of Figota. The Duke of Figota saw the questioning eyes, his face changed slightly, and seemed to be stiff; but after a moment of stiffness, he nodded lightly. Later, Sid continued: "...Frazol; Rasta Lustra, Viscount, he should be able to do anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lasol; Rasta?" Gustav snorted. "The name seems familiar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He used to be two years ago The court guarded the knight, perhaps at that time, he saw his majesty." Sid replied, "Now his public identity is the rapporteur of the Liberation Knights, Rasa Rita. As for other special envoys, I will continue to look for it, and I must make my Majesty satisfied. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it’s him... his sword is very powerful." Gustav remembered the guardian knight who had a swordmanship and ordered it. Nod, "So that's it. Please plan as soon as possible. I sincerely hope that I can get half of the South without blood. The meeting - right, Chalinburg and Eagle Wing, two can take the time to start preparing for Soma. Dagong’s official closure ceremony. We may use this ceremony to prove ours to the south... . ' "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; with everyone stood up, bowed to him, leaving a lot of files after exit. After everyone left, the emperor stood up, dragging his legs and walking towards his bedroom, ready to go to the list of today's meeting and dinner attendees. Day after day, together with his staff, they worked hard to maintain this huge empire in different aspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gustav has never been ashamed of horses, cigarettes, and camps as it is now, something that is completely different from his current boring life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
