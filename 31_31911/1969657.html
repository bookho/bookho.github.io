			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;viii<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May+65 Empire Territory in the evening of June 5, 1666 Stav (formerly Gistof)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gistov-Kengler Prominence Defence Campaign entered the fifth day, but the Empire was in Gisto There are no prominent parts near the husband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city named after the emperor is burning. The walls that were not completely repaired were smashed on the ground, the cannons were transformed into scrap iron by deformation, and countless supplies piled up in the square into a burning fire. The capital of those things should be transported to the hands of the emperors in the south of the area, but now their masters have not taken care of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire of the empire, the Maitrebi corps, who is responsible for guarding the supply line, has become a mess. The former Free Army soldiers who had fought for the government of the government almost collapsed, and joined the camp to join Lopez; the stubborn aristocratic officers were separated, and the headquarters of several brigades were successively taken off. Finally, the front finally retreated to the city of Gustav where the Legion Command was located. The last Imperial Company evacuated the city at noon on June 5, while the Western Army Command moved in at dusk. It took the Northerners three days to take the city, and it took the Southerners four hours to retake the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price is of course high. Five days ago, General Lopez had more than 70 Clade self-propelled guns to participate in the offensive, but now only 13 can be moved. The anchored, fallen into the deep ditch, directly by the artillery, destroyed by the magic trap... The valuable engineering and magical power of the Western Army had to be dispersed, and the troops were repaired to the self-propelled guns that were not completely destroyed. In order to ensure that the operational tasks of the Imperial Remnants who are abandoned by their own people can be completed on time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the chaos of the logistics department, Clade; Lieutenant General Lopez and his staff went into the queue of the eighth regiment. The gates of the city. Except for the first two regiments, the remaining five teams just continued to move forward with a little rest. The lieutenant personally led the troops who were really ready to take over the city. The three most advanced cities of the steel monsters following the action directly drove to the square where the emperor landed on the dragon two months ago. The citizens of the uprising formed a self-policing group, spontaneously surrounding them to “prevent the spoilage” and chatted about their great achievements in the night of the Lennie coup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lopez took the staff around the crowd and stopped at a flag that was stepped on by many soldiers. He recognized the iron cross heraldry above. "It is the flag of the emperor. Has he been to the city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the interrogation of the captive, he is still here this morning." His chief staff Lieutenant Colonel Ayr frowned, bent over and picked up the dirty flag, smashed the dust above, neatly stacked and handed it over to the staff on the side. "I have already confessed that the frontline troops will hand over all enemy flags and coats of arms to the intelligence department. It seems that this is missing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" To improve the morale of the troops, they can be used as a means of exhaustion. If we move for a few hours, the war may end here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we want to catch the emperor is difficult. They have dragons, and now we can't shoot down those dragons for the time being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only two or three are true dragons The rest are pterosaurs.” Klad took out his pocket watch and glanced at the present time. “If the interspersed troops in front of us can arrive on time, there may be hope... the next landing of the emperor is not in the north. In the east, the troops in the north should be coming soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert frowned slightly and reminded: "Hello, the goal of the battle is good, but We can't fight on the premise of its success. What's more, we can't let the entire staff department The slightest grasp of the emperor’s hopes has taken place in such a high place. Except for the general reserve team, all our troops have reached the limit.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You are married Is Lieutenant Colonel Ayre?” Clad’s sudden speech made Robert stunned, and he shook his head seriously as usual. “No.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No wonder. If you have important people involved in the war, you will be looking for ways to quickly end this bloody game. "Klad understandd and smiled. "You are the chief staff officer. It is up to you to decide how to act. If the emperor's landing field is in the east, Kengler may be able to catch up. Hull and our tenth division. It is also agreed to meet today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I personally think that there are 60% chances for the emperor to be there... This is a trouble for you, Lieutenant Colonel Ayr. Even though I am bold and bold, I believe that General Eugen will handle it well." The middle-aged general played. I yawn, "I will go to take a nap for a while. When things come to an end, let's take a break. All the troops will be taken to rest this evening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I intend to insist that the Western Army has been completely defeated." The unusually dedicated Lieutenant Colonel shook his head and shook his head. "I estimate that one day our interweaving troops will completely eliminate the few remaining command posts. It’s not a time to rest now.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”So this is an order. Go to sleep for eight hours, Lieutenant Colonel Ayre! I don’t want to rely on a bloodshot Chief Staff. In Lenny, the emperor and 70,000 people are waiting for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...that's okay." Robert is not willing to accept With this order, "I will take a break after I have handed over these orders. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krad nodded and walked to the long table of the city council, pulled a few chairs and put a bed out, almost immediately fell asleep It’s gone. Robert called a staff member, let him carefully protect the room with silent magic, and then went to find a room to rest and restore the magic. During this time, his order passed seven formalities and was handed over to the Battle of the Steele Army Staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May+66 on the outskirts of June 6th, 2006, outside the county of Kensler; Steelburg Army Staff<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order was sent to the staff of the Steelburg Army, causing an uproar. From the map, the Fort Stilt is organizing a final offensive against Kegler's peripheral strongholds in order to rescue the South Wings who are struggling. The emperor's city line outside Kengal is like a nail embedded in the two Freedom Forces between the North and the South. They are trying to stop the Stilburg Army and Klad's General Reserve fifth freedom division. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We believe that the Emperor and his flying battalion are now retreating towards the rear. Considering your situation, he will definitely stay near Kengal. Order your department to pay close attention. If you find a silver dragon, please immediately concentrate all possible combat power to form a air interception team..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steelburg Army The combat staff was resistant to the door; Soledon shook his head as he read it. "Would you like us to be a dragonslayer? That would be enough to mobilize all the people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Silver Dragon? Are you referring to the group of things that are flying over our heads? The instructions from the headquarters are really timely." Assistant combat staff Jacques; Lieutenant Pierre under the cover of shadow magic, pointed to sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was raised and he saw the dazzling wingspan. A silver dragon, and more than a dozen pterosaurs. Those flying gods did not seem to find their field command under the cover of magic, swept directly from their heads and rushed to Kengle, who was under siege. He sweared a swearing word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh my God, it’s really the emperor!" Jacques was excited at the wrong time. "Lieutenant, this is the greatest credit in 20 years! Remember Conti; Why did the Fox Artillery coach become the commander-in-chief? Just because he killed the former emperor! Use the tactics recorded on the last page of the officer's handbook, Lieutenant!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The one on the last page of the Officer's Handbook? What's the name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Saturation Attack! Put all the casters together and divide them into four roles. Several combat teams are formed to support each other and block the entire airspace..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Saturation attack? There is no magic support for the offensive force! This will not distribute magic power. Will be countered by the enemy reinforcements!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door shouted loudly and climbed up from the bench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he got up too hard, his head hit the corner of the table. The mountainous files on the table immediately trembled with this external shock, creating an avalanche and burying the poor combat staff underneath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a nightmare, Solayton?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a female voice, he listens This is the logistics staff Anne; Seifer's voice, then replied with a forehead: "No, I just made a dream to make a plan. In the dream, the Western Army wants us to make a breakthrough front line and leave enough The magical force intercepts the plan of the Emperor Guard..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah... maybe it was just hurt and lost my memory." The door touched the back of the head and got up from the command pile. "What time is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "At eight o'clock, there are still half an hour to issue a combat order." Annie said a joke in a cold tone. "Since the jurisdiction is assigned to the Western Army, we are all overloaded. It’s normal to have a memory loss, so that the story can’t be continued.... Then, Uncle Lopez’s use of other people’s troops is really welcome.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is also what it should be. After all, we are the weakest point on this front."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is standing up and holding the table Looking for Anne's location. At first glance, he did not find it. After a while, he followed the writing voice and found her behind a pile of file mountains. The blond female niece grabbed a squirt pen in the left and right hands, writing a neat signature and commentary at a speed that the naked eye could hardly keep up with. Her appearance looks like there is no sign of fatigue, the blue eyes are still crystal clear, the hair is softly parked behind the neck, and even the hairstyle is not chaotic. She summoned two cats as pets, and the two cats were diligently dragging the files out of the file pile and placing them in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, you look so good." Nana did not have to look in the mirror to know how tired he looked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie shrugged: "This is fake, I just added it with illusion. Staying up late is the enemy of beauty, I don't want you to see me." The appearance after staying up late. I have to finish and approve the last supply changes within fifteen minutes. If you haven't refreshed the potion, take it to my chest pocket."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "No, I took a bottle last night." Nanimen began to rummage in his pocket. "Why, do you have so many things to write on hand?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really lost your memory? In yesterday's storm, my three assistant logistics staff lost their fighting power. One was killed, one was missing, one was blown off his right hand and sent. You took a bottle of refreshing potion last night, but three bottles, and you have already drunk it. Come and take it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne bowed his head, Like a cat, he used his lips to pick up a light yellow test tube from his chest pocket and blinked at him. Her hands did not stop, and the two cats were quickly changing the documents in front of her. The door was swallowed, and the refreshing potion was taken from her mouth. I felt a lot better when I drank it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, I had a home book late last night, delivered through pure gold channels. On the table, the most conspicuous one." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Home book?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Zalt and Sister Weilen give you the book, it’s a book. To get this letter out of the Loney siege, it’s also a fee. I have a brain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door saw the letter at a glance. He threw himself up like a traveler who saw the water in the desert, tearing open the envelope quickly. The letter is not very long. Most of the things mentioned are just ordinary blessings and daily chores, but the love is still overflowing on the stationery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small cable...Now should it be Lieutenant Solitaire? I’m listening to Anne with the nun, you said that you did a good job at the Fort Stilt, in a few We have been outstanding in the second battle, and we are very happy. Usually we should be careful, do not be too heroic and pay attention to the body. We are very good here, and the financial difficulties are basically solved by General Lopez and pure gold. Some of your descendants are also clamoring to go to the army, which makes us very troubled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent emperor also hit the city of Lenny, we all do I have helped the volunteers on the wall. I have never seen the soldiers of the empire for more than a decade. They seem to be more refined than before. The Free Army almost lost the outer wall and the fourth wall. Lieutenant Colonel Tedwood is a shrewd and powerful star. He organized several successful counterattacks. Since last week, the emperor has not attacked again, and the traffic on the river has also recovered. It seems that Lenny is still safe. You don’t have to Worry about us, work hard with you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attachment: The nun said that you have to make a quick decision. If you think that the Safir Lieutenant is not bad, you can order the goods first. It is not too late to pay after the end of the game. Or do you still have a fantasy about a general's daughter? Rest assured, we will not Tell them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door saw the last note, hurriedly hid the letter and prevented Anne from seeing it. "Really, what are these people thinking..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, nothing, just..." Nana suddenly thought of a serious matter. "No! They said that Lenny's emperor has not launched an attack in a week!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Do you want to say that the Empire has shifted its focus? But they have made several attacks in the direction of Steelburg and there seems to be no sign of a large-scale move."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just think... will they secretly mobilize reinforcements to Kengal? Our positive resistance is not like the 10,000-strong Kengal Army. Resistance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie thought about it and shook her head: "No, I think it’s because the reinforcements of the Western Army have not arrived. We can break through every day. Peripheral defense, but every day they can make a new one. The space behind them is too big, and someone must strike from the south. Today, the fifth division is coming, and our ammunition is now more abundant. Can win."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen is very interested to ask: " Is the medicine abundant? Why? Because you work hard?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No, it’s because there are fewer troops to be allocated. We can’t break through for five days, we’ve already There are more than 80 dangerous lines with half of the losses, and they can no longer be attacked. They can only arrange to return to Fort Stilt. The bases of each unit have not decreased, but increased. This is also the reason why I have to adjust the distribution table day and night. The kind of books that nobody wants to send, it seems to be sent a lot..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come down. He is a combat staff, and this result... at least not a compliment to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne patted him on the shoulder: "Go, the total attack is about to begin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The warrior removes the mask!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Steelburger removes the mask!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The General Reserve and the General Staff remove the masking!!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Camp is revealed from the dark cover, and the anti-detection set by the headquarters The magic was removed. The sun reappeared over the camp, and the people who remained in the camp listened to orders and rushed to their respective zones. General Eugen concentrated his last two main teams, preparing to attack the main forces of the South; and Luther corrected the final brief mobilization of the "temporary" pastors in the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today the friendly on the southern line is coming! This is our last attack today! All our gunfire will open the way for you! Your battle today Will be exchanged for the most dazzling medal in your military career! Come with me and take the enemy guarded ridge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His loud voice is in the sound With the help of magic, it reverberates over the entire battlefield, and both the enemy and the friendly can hear it. For those who stayed in the camp, the voice was deafening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captured Olia; Hugh; the first princess of Coman heard these words in his own camp, unable to rest on the bed, sarcasm "The politicians, what they are best at, is to use the rhetoric to encourage others to go into battle. Have they ever taken a horse in front of the square? If we have such a knight there, you will definitely let them go back. The waiter re-started."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pluto is not such a person!" Living with her - in fact, Metty, who is on the task of surveillance, retorted "You didn't hear him say 'Come with me'? And, and he is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know. But his body is really Can I rush to the front line?" Olily sat up and sneered. "Have you seen your Mr. Luther's charge? No, even if he wants to charge, his physique will probably He died in the first battle. Southerners."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...He is not a coward. I believe him, he encourages Get away from the meaningless life ...... "Giacometti stood up, walked in the camps and anxiety. Olia felt that she could see what was going on in the girl’s mind. "He is summoning all the people who can use magic... I will go too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meddy put on her casual clothes and ran straight out of the tent. The two guards who had just changed their class at the door didn't stop her. This task is not on their list. They just whistled, exchanged whispers of pornography, and chatted about the anecdotes they had guessed. They are sincerely respecting Luther’s serious and sacred appearance and the identity of the bishop, but this does not affect their speculation about the private life of the boss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are money, right, and priesthood. This kind of person is not in a world with us. As long as he wants, there will be no shortage of women. The priests are like this... Women like them, who knows why? "Why don't anyone like a soldier?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, this is what you said. You dare say you didn't think about those nuns and female pastors? Are you going to Are those female soldiers who are rolling in the mud like us all day long? The thoughts of the ladies and ladies are not far from you and me. Do you dare say that you didn't think about the pastor?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Capture you dare? It is definitely a death sentence!" "This is exciting, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They lowered their voices, but these conversations were passed to Olivia, making her very annoyed. As the first princess of the empire, she knew that she should not worry about it. The princess should always be self-cultivating, arrogant, and different from others. What the princess should do is to find the right prince and then assist him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These people don't know my identity, I am educated, I shouldn't be angry with them, they don't know..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Miss Namlock, who is a captive and has been a pastor for three years in the South, does not think so. Here is the South, a free country with evil degeneration. The women here are uncultivated, and they are openly dressed in military uniforms in the military camp full of stinky men. They do not understand their vocation as a woman. They are all very bad, especially the Lieutenant Sefer who manages all the logistical problems, the impulsive, lacking nerves, the big girl, the girl who will charge ahead of the man... damn, what kind of education Will a woman become like that? There is no trick that likes to be liked, only action. Even the maids with the lowest status will not be like her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She should not be angry with soldiers in such countries, no matter how obscene they say. Olia stood up and picked up the curtain of the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, both. You are too loud. I have heard it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The two soldiers are a glimpse. They were trying to stop her, but after hearing this sentence, they all bowed their heads with shame. Olia shook her head angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the name of God, how can you get this color? This is fallen! You should reflect!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn't know why she is doing this. Why is she coming to be serious with these low-ranking people? She raised her hand in a self-defeating manner and hit the face of one of the soldiers heavily. With the power of anger against yourself and the young soldiers, with the power from devout faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look, it’s too much to be beaten..." Another soldier’s gloating was stuck in the eyes of the blind man. He saw his companion slammed into the tent by this inconspicuous slap and made a dull noise. Before he could react, a similar slap hit his right face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are simply when I don't have the ability to defend myself." Olia said angrily to herself, taking pictures of her body. She took off her dress and high heels, hid her long hair in a military cap and put on the costume of the soldier. She let another fainting soldier still stand in a standing position, and recited a prayer to ensure that he would be here in fifteen minutes. Then she began to think about what to do next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her brother, Gustav is nearby. There is also his silver dragon and his huge army...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well, not huge. The young staff member said, "The emperor who stayed in Kengal was only a third of the army, less than 10,000. They thought that the attack would only come in one direction."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be the case, her brother only left enough power to resist an attack in one direction. At least 30,000 people will be attacked by the Free Army. The rule of the Empire against the city of Jules will collapse at any time. This is the last chance. It is useless to educate in this country. She has to work hard and escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows the real names of all the dragons in the Empire. She can call them at any time to attack and destroy their headquarters. She can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Start this destruction at the right time, at the right place...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
