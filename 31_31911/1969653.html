			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May 29, 1666, mday+28, northwestern suburb of Kungler, the city of Kyuller<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called court life is a tea party, a banquet and a dance party. At least, in the case of Monica, the "first princess of the Holy Empire," the court life is like this. Even in the battlefield of artillery, this life has not wavered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the war is tense, everyone will simply prepare a tea party. When the court is better, the emperor will hold a banquet, but the ball will only be held after the key victory. . After all, this is the front line, everything has to be simple, the decoration of the palace can not be too particular, the building can only be built by the magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After half a month, we will hold a grand ball at Kengal. If you need a new dress, just customize it, I think the court tailors There should be no suitable size for your clothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the main force of the Emperor was still in Gustav City, the emperor pointed out the map with an understatement. The meaning of that sentence is that his army will launch the second Battle of Kengal in half a month and once again conquer the city. The place where her former "command" army was beaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor’s intention is the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Princess Olia! The dance will start in six hours, please go to make up!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid flew in and urged her for the third time. She had to stand up and meet the royal makeup artists and tailors. It is difficult for Junica to understand why makeup is going to be used throughout the afternoon, but she has to follow the rules. To some extent, makeup can hide the subtle flaws of her transformation into magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These dresses are very lining you, Your Royal Highness. I don't know what jewelry you plan to use?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Ten dresses were made in half a month. The Royal Emperor of the Second Empire used all the luxurious ornaments accumulated for four hundred years. Unheard of rare perfumes, rare spices from the East, South and the New World. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this can be chosen by her. This should be the biggest dream of a young girl, but now she is not happy. Every maid and servant had doubts on their faces, and the rest of the ladies in the make-up room whispered, and they were all worried about the dance tonight. No one came to talk to her, but those gossips were blown into her ears with the wind of eavesdropping magic,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can this be a dance?" The princess is here, probably it is serious..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows what the ladies are worried about. There is only one key issue: Kengal has not been compromised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is now in a normal town on the King’s Road, thirty kilometers from Kengal. The 70,000-strong army was launched within 20 kilometers from here to the east, and was fighting with the Central Army of the Free Army, ruled by Marshal Fox. Since Steelburg repelled the Fourth Army, it has become the only opportunity for the Emperor. Only from now on, all the Free Army will lay down their arms and welcome the King, and the ball will be held in Kengal on time; but until now, no good news has been heard. When I thought of it, I couldn’t sit still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She picked a necklace with a large sapphire ornament and stood up and walked out the door. The maids and guards were busy going out and saw their "His Royal Highness" standing in front of the carriage track not far away. The sleek, four-marathon giant transport carriage ran on the iron rails, sending ammunition, weapons and food to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Block the car," she told the maid around her, "Go to the headquarters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Several maids around were shocked and hurriedly grabbed her clothes. "Your Majesty should be on the front line, you should be careful as your Royal Highness Princess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 waved his hand without hesitation, personally blocking the track. A carriage stopped suddenly and almost ran out of orbit. "Take me there! I also have the right to know what he intends to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor is not in the headquarters, she has requisitioned Shulan; Dimartel himself, His subordinates and the hardened stone road of Ma Cheshun's new shop rushed to the Second Army Command. At the Second Army Command, she learned that Gustav had personally gone to the front line in order to supervise the operation. He had to leave a maid and rushed to the front line command with the guards. The Frontline Command was established in a Protestant church outside the former town, less than ten kilometers from Kengal. As long as you take it here, the Freedom Army will no longer be able to defend. You can only choose to retreat to Kengal or withdraw to Lenny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Olia?! What are you doing here? Do you know that this is a dangerous frontline? Go back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Danger? For me, as long as you There is no danger in the convenience of the place. Is there anything more dangerous for the empire than to lose the emperor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor who was refuted by Seneca Looking at Shulan with a bad look, "Do you tell her that I am here, Di Mattel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡迈前步, Blocked in front of the guards. "I want to come by myself, because everyone is worried about the dance tonight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the word "dance", the emperor's brow locks even more Tight. Before he even spoke, all the staff around him had quietly lowered their heads. On one of the epaulets, two generals who stared the star slammed the sword of the Marquis family into the table: "Sorry, all of us are not fighting well, so that our majesty is disappointed. Give us three days, definitely Take Kengler!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short sword attached to the unknown does not know what magic. Gustav shook his head and went forward, pulling it out with two fingers in an understatement - this action is far from being as simple as it seems. Yanika was shocked. She thought that the emperor was a weak, spoiled aristocrat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not your fault, Palenic. Everyone has gone all out, but the enemy’s resistance is too tenacious. As you said, Postpone the dance for three days..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you just dance here?" Yanika suddenly inserted in. "Also let you The bloody soldiers will take a break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here?!" More than one person subconsciously screamed. After discovering that the emperor really seriously considered this matter, the generals and the staff were even more shocked. They were busy turning their attention to the help of a person who had been standing in the corner and said nothing. At the crucial moment, only this talent is likely to convince the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The embassy’s most acclaimed cabinet minister, one of the makers of this war plan, security minister Sid, Nasser. Everyone believes that he will stop the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, there are at least one division in the frontal enemy, and the strength is not weaker than us; the leader is Fox, the former chief of staff is Lopez. The deputy. It is impossible to win with our current strength. We can only wait for them to bear the loss as before, and retreat themselves." Sid’s discourse was expressionless, but it is justified to tell the present. Case. "Unless..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unless?" Gustav came to the spirit when he heard the word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, Sid’s attitude does not seem to be very opposed. "The total reserve team, the entire guards are all thrown in. But then we can't attack Kengal again, and certainly can't go down to Lenny immediately. If you can make this determination, we can make a development here. The plan for the decisive battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Decisive battle? Indeed, the battles of the past two months can no longer be repeated. Repel, repel, or repel! We must fight A annihilation battle!" Gustav walked to the map, and the scepter was in Kengal's position, pushing the nearby chess pieces representing the two armies. "I can probably guess what the plan is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s only a little different. The plan is perfect, but it’s too dangerous.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid promoted two pieces representing the enemy, and Gustav resolutely pushed it back. The surrounding staff have whispered in a whisper. Renee was curious and sneaked forward to watch: she saw that the blue pieces representing the Free Army were concentrated around the town under her feet, while the black pieces representing the emperor cut off the distance. All roads in the south. What does this mean? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to let the Royal Highness Princess and the ladies also be in the center of this dangerous bait? Do you believe that the Guardian can stop the opponent?" Sid hit the nail on the head The key to the problem is that “the enemy did not know that you were here. But this time you are directly involved in the Guardian, it is tantamount to telling them.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Gustav once stopped. Just as he lifted his scepter again to retreat, Reneka's hand pressed against the hand he held "power." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Olivia..." The emperor stared at his sister and looked at him for a long while. Renee was seen by his scalp numb, and his forehead pulled out tiny sweat. Has she performed too much? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come out, we need to talk. We are going back to the rear, planning and dancing, please," Sid. Xiulan contacted the Guardian. Reinforcement. Building the venue... It’s called the guy who just lost.” Gustav picked up her hand and walked out of the command, leaving only a group of surprised officers behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I first saw my Majesty evacuation from the front line in advance. In the past, no matter how fierce the war, he strictly followed the schedule."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it because of the relationship of His Royal Highness Princess?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Security coughed and helped his own piece glasses. "Go to work. There will be a decisive battle tonight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two took the horse from the horse and listened to the guns in the town. The original security company commander insisted on giving them guards, in case they encountered the infiltrated infantry squad that the Freedom Army was good at, but the emperor refused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The average team, we can still cope with both. Focus on the attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; They did not encounter any enemy scouts along the way, because the reserve team of the Second Army was rushing to the town in a company and filling it into the bottomless flesh mill. What bothered the emperor was that every company officer saw that the famous pale gold breastplate would stop, line up, and order everyone to salute. He had to return to court and encourage their morale. After repeating this four times, their patience finally reached the limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this doesn't work, it will delay the troops marching. How about taking the trail behind the hills?" Yanika saw Gustav's embarrassment and offered to propose Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it’s just fine today." The emperor looked around, "just go from that gentle slope."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinica is strolling on a gentle hillside and looking at the remains of the battles of the past few days. Each of the highlands was once the main point of the Free Army, and still can see the traces left by the battle: the bullets and shells fired by the two sides are dotted in the white and yellow flowers, and the fragrance is filled with traces of smoke. Almost every hill in the grass is lying on the stone monument of the emperor, and the engineering mages will engrave the name of the army and the fallen on it. Some emperors are still guarded by some of the stone monuments. The emperor carefully avoided these checkpoints and did not affect their duty. I don't know why, they never talked until I found a stream in the creek to propose a rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you afraid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the emperor suddenly asked such a headless The problem, just dismounting the handkerchief who washed his hands at the edge of the stream turned around. "What are you afraid of?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the front line where you can die at any time, are you not afraid? Once the army is defeated or an accident occurs, even the retreat There is no time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The princess" held his chin for a moment and shook his head. "This level is probably not afraid. When you venture outside, it is often more dangerous than this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, she is now Everything you do every moment is extremely dangerous. There is still confidence in dealing with a few unscrupulous soldiers, but there is no chance of winning the military machine of the entire empire - as long as her identity is broken, it must face the latter situation. In contrast, the possibility of being killed by guns in the front-line headquarters is much lower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she heard her answer, the emperor sat down on the stone beside her, her face showing a strange expression. Even from a close distance, his appearance is almost without a trace: it is full of prestige, and the emperor standard of those marble sculptures is generally handsome and handsome. At this moment, this handsome face is engraved, but it is an indescribable painful expression. No one thinks that people at the summit of the power pyramid will show this expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you are better suited to be the emperor, Olia than me. In fact, I am afraid all the time."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senikan’s eyes widened. The Gustav emperor, who is known for his bravery, actually said that he... fear? This scene of departure from common sense made her afraid. Did she say anything wrong? "Fear... fear? Brother, are you? You are not afraid of the front line of the flying ball, what are you afraid of?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor looked at the eyes of Renee, saying it word by word. The girl thought he was joking at first, but then found out that he was serious. When it comes to these things, Gustav's hand and the injured leg are shaking slightly; she hurriedly held his right hand and calmed him down. The hand was cold like a cold iron. After a long time, she reacted to the "next successor" referring to "Princess Olia" herself. The emperor is still talking incessantly, and his style of speech is very different. How long has he been unable to find a person to describe this? After all, he is just a young man in his early twenties...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...In fact, I don’t want to go to the front line, I don’t like those fragrant parties and Dance. But in order to improve morale and ensure everyone's loyalty to me, I have to do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Yanika saw the emperor's With a glance at the leg, the heart nodded. If she had to walk on her own with a cane, she would have heard the word "dance". "But you still do it, don't you? When I traveled, I heard this saying: Only those who know what is fear can face the reality calmly. People who don't know what fear is, only the rest Reckless. Knowing fear but still courageously facing it, this virtue is called courage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for listening to me, Olia. Now I feel much better. I have always been afraid that it is a reckless mistake to launch this war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"History will prove everything."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks at her and then smiles. Everything that happened just now is like never happened. Suddenly, her body heated up and reddish blood rushed to her cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not shy, it’s the magic she uses to detect changes around her, and she’s reminding her that the danger is coming in the most urgent way. The first bullet flew past her hair, and at the same time she heard the gunshots. The girl’s unforgettable memory reminds her of the model of the gunshot. She is familiar with the gunshots, and she can hear the muffled sound of this elliptical bullet in every day she is in charge of the government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front line of the rifle, the prototype of many kinds of enchanted guns, including the implosion gun, the only one in the Free Army with an accuracy of two hundred meters away. The firearms are arguable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...hunter class?!" Renee exclaimed. She remembers this compilation and remembers it very clearly. Assault companies are the limited forces of the Freedom Force's magical powers, and the Hunting Class is the most elite infiltrator. It is responsible for the same tasks as the regular company reconnaissance class, but has a choice of orders other than "retreating when encountering an enemy." The Hunting Class has the right to launch a strike against any local target of its choice. Obviously, this hunter class has been eyeing Gustav's conspicuous gold armor for a long time. In her memory, each Hunter class has six soldiers with front-loading rifles -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I guard."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gustav sings softly. The inconspicuous cane in his hand quickly lifted and tapped the ground. More bullets from different directions hit the ubiquitous protective net, making a dull pounce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I refuse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bullets and magic bounce back along the way, hitting Those who shoot them. The Freedom Army soldiers frustrated to resist, and the figure of the emperor was worn out of this protective net. The blood of Keman burned, and his speed has almost reached the limit of human imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I ordered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devilish impulse appeared in the position that was exposed because of the shot Free military minds. The first group of two snipers first dropped the gun, then the second group of two. Several other people who were backing up hurriedly tried to organize the attack, and their conspicuous red uniforms became the direct target of the next blow. The bullets fired by these people only swept the emperor's figure. I don't know if it was originally biased, or was escaped by his super high-speed movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I dominate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this magical password, Freedom Army soldiers Take a short bayonet from the military boots and fight each other. The remaining reason allowed them not to attack the key points of their comrades, but they had no time to meet the fast-moving emperors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am trial!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can see the existence of power, and even few people understand it: when they finally see the power of power, they have no chance to resist it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weapon can and can only be used by big people who have the courage, speed and reaction at the same time. The range of magic covers all the targets within fifty meters. Huge psychological pressure directly invaded the minds of the Freedom Army soldiers, and the conscience of conscience shrouded them until their intellect collapsed. From the discovery of the first enemy to the fall of the ninth enemy, all this happened only for a short period of time, and it was only until the time that Jenica had just pulled out the pocket watch. Of course, that is also the royal collection that she came with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't say a hunter class, even a single assault company can't rival him! No wonder the imperial emperor rarely succumbs to assassination. Speaking... Just now his legs seem to be very flexible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor walked back to her, still a little embarrassed. Renee was busy collecting curiosity, posing a smile, welcoming him to triumph, but his eyes still unconsciously squatting on the legs of the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After your hard work, this level of enemies is really not enough. Do you want to take a break?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Of course. It’s safe now, and those people won’t wake up before sunset.” Gustav noticed his sister’s gaze and smiled bitterly. “This leg has returned to normal physiologically. It has been treated by both the Pope and the Cardinal. It has only been used for many years and it is estimated that it will not be completely cured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way." She is hard The student resisted the idea of ​​continuing to ask the reason and changed the topic. "How long do we rest..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice has not yet fallen, the emperor has fallen on her shoulder. Renee was busy with him, sat down at the horse, and put his head on his knee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, it is the blood of Coman, and it is the same to rest on rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the place where the emperor had defeated the enemy, the saliva of the grass was trembled. The girl was shocked first, but then she reacted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A hunter class should be thirteen people? So, four have long been..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that she no longer has to worry about security issues, she quietly used a magic to reduce weight, holding the emperor to the nearest, open-minded place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Gustav wakes up again, the setting sun has sunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat up from the pocket of Yanika and found himself on a hill full of yellow flowers. The girl behind her sleeps well and seems to have no idea what the weight on her knees will suddenly disappear. Looking at his sister's sleeping face, the emperor smiled unconsciously, but the smile turned into melancholy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you my sister..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up his own cloak, When she wanted to cover "Olia", the girl opened her eyes. "Your Majesty, is time coming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, almost." The emperor hurriedly turned his head and looked at Kengal’s direction. "It took an afternoon. The Guardian should be reinforced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we will leave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;古Stav tried to pretend that he hadn't said that sentence, and that Nika was trying to pretend that she didn't hear it. After all, no matter who you are, it is much safer than hearing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they are still on the road, the battle is over. The silver-loaded soldiers who had finished the battle in just two hours were cleaning the battlefield, leaving only the last touch of light on the horizon. For the most proud troops of the emperor, this is not a hard fight; strangely, the losers of the battle are not much dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much loss?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The frontline troops lost 30% of their combat power, but they successfully withdrew Come out. It has been determined that the other party is the Emperor Guards, and with their pride they are sure that we are deliberately retreating."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
