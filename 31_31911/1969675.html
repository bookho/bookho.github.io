Captain Soledon stood in the middle of the battlefield and looked forward to the steady advancement of his own army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All troops are all attacking, attacking, and attacking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With him, there are fewer than ten guards left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before him, there are a large number of enemy troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind him, there is no more camp for the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his hands, is a flag of freedom filled with holes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not a hero. He can stand here just because it is a coincidence. But now, the Free Army needs him to stand here, invest all the power, and lead the final attack... Perhaps it should be said that history requires him to stand here and command the final s attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because victory is calling him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once asked Clade Lopez: "What is victory?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Victory It’s not a military advantage, because there are countless people who have won less. Victory is not a morale advantage, because there are countless people who have fought back. Even the cut-off of logistics is not a victory, because there are countless people who have been ruined by food.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general who knows the Eastern Art of War replied: "When the victory comes, a commander will know. There is such an opportunity, as long as the troops are put in, the enemy can be allowed." Crash - that is victory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this timing is right in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premise is to solve the dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver dragon with the Hehronwei, who hardened his army from the front! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is almost bitten by the roots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this such a big card in the hands of the other party? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Longwei is enough to delay his march! The recruits have begun to panic. If you are dragged by this dragon for half an hour, he may lose this opportunity! It is impossible to re-successfully rehabilitate the dangerous behavior of the defeated soldiers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not time to save magic and equipment. The captain directed the army and informed the performer Metty Crosso, who was next to the magical cannon "Slayer's Melody" through the communication badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Crosso! Meet! Meet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have never tried this Frequently added!" Only the 16-year-old girl player protested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that you are very hard, but if you can't hold it here, it's all over!" The doorman lowered his voice. "Can do it, the piano." The design goal is to win two dragons at the same time! This is my lifelong request!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, okay--"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another impromptu sonata. Tone conversion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge magical group has been shackled on the Secretary of Security, and the re-generated new melody is not as big and amazing as it used to be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five, six, seven, eight... a little faster, Metty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meti once again speeded up the pace, slender fingers almost flying on the keyboard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music is speeding up, cascading, and progressing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beginning is seventy-six shots, "beautiful soft board", then ninety-eight shots, "such as the song board", followed by one hundred Twenty shots, "the medium speed board." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic flow of color flows from the metal tube at the top of the organ and converges into a brand new rainbow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver Dragon squinted and looked at the magical net of the opposite rainbow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human magician needs to enhance the flow of magic through magic enhancement, and the dragon's eyes can directly see the magic itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen... too fast, this wave can't be avoided." Mara's voice passed directly into it. In the mind of the female dragon knight, "those will be handed over to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon saddle is quite sturdy, and the card of the sinica is directly attached to it. Three safety ropes tied her body and protected her safety to the fullest extent without affecting her actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 swayed and stood up, facing the direction of the dragon's tail, pulling the sword out of the sheath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pleasing organ melody seems to never stop, tearing her nerves. She listened wholeheartedly to the changes in the rhythm and calculated the musical magic that was concentrated in the opposite direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 doesn’t know much about music, but she can count the beat of the music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two seconds and five times is a hundred and fifty shots, "Hua Cai's Allegro." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melody immediately enters **, she can count one second and three times, one hundred and eighty shots are "noisy emergency". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twenty-six, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty...no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The "humility" in the hands of 黛妮卡 scatters the invisible field of the monk, swallowing her magic to strengthen her physical strength, making the sword appear heavier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metty sitting at the front of the organ can't see this scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her arms are completely taut, and the sweat is flowing freely on the keys. Because of too much effort, the fingertips have been wiped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four notes per second, two hundred and eight beats, "the most urgent of the brilliant." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is almost no music, but the summer afternoon showers. This speed cannot be maintained all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the girl organist knocked the end of the major chord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people and dragons are looking forward to this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 34th Dragon Slayer's ray splits from the rainbow, chasing the silver dragon's tail, trying to shoot down this savvy behemoth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ejection!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ninja’s left foot hooked up and started on the dragon saddle organ. The upper and the bottom of the boot are separated up and down, and the centrifugal force throws her body out of the dragon's back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safety rope tightly stretched her body, dragging her behind the silver dragon, flying, attracting all the firepower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 coughed a few times, smashed the useless boot, and hooked the safety rope with the feet of the **, by this stock The power adjusted in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no law in all kinds of things--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yang, 斩, 斩 斩! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"--Nerve Silence!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forehand, Backhand, Crossover! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music was suddenly interrupted, just as someone cut the string of the organ. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strongest anti-magic weapon "humble" swordsmanship, magic is all invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No music. No rainbows. There are no white clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afternoon sun is projected on the earth, and the entire battlefield seems to be immersed in absolute silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organist’s hand slipped off the keyboard and dragged six different lengths of blood, softening the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meddy took out her handkerchief with her trembling right hand and wiped her face. On the handkerchief woven from white silk, nosebleeds and sweat immersed in a ball. She "giggle" and smiled twice, picking up her communication badge with her almost cramped left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No return, endurance. You can do it yourself, I have to sleep for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young captain smiled and did not respond, but dropped the communication badge that had expired directly on the ground. He looked up and stared at the little figure dragging behind the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anti-magic weapon..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly, what he stares, not The little figure, but the safety rope that connects the figure and the dragon saddle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the battlefield he has chosen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently "咔". A pair of black wingspan, a pair of tough claws, cut off the precious hemp rope that links the dragon knight and the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 just breathed a sigh of relief and suddenly felt that the back was loose, the whole person lost speed and balance, and the parabola fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She subconsciously turned her head and saw only a playful blonde, and a pair of perfect black wings. The owner of the pair of wings is chasing Mara and almost biting her tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She feels that this back and this figure are very familiar. Every time she sees the almost perfect waist, hips and chest, she can feel a complex feeling of envy and jealousy. In the public bathhouse of Lenny, she held the owner of the body and secretly cursed the injustice of countless times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a certain Seifer, Anne or Bonnie, absolutely. The twins who care about the heavens are not as perfect as human beings. Oh, the pair of black wings probably indicates that they are not human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what you said -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 bowed his head. Just below her, it happened to be the free flag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl did not hesitate to throw out the "humble" in her hand, and at the moment of magic recovery, she smashed the "Floating" spell and stopped her own haste. whereabouts. Even so, when the descent stopped, she also found herself only one distance from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedommen’s Musketeers reacted, and the 3rd and 4th lead shots were almost pasted on her body. A magician without defensive magic protection is so fragile that an accurate bullet can kill her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡手抄, grabbed the top of the flagpole, turned over, stepped on the top of the free flag, and gave himself a bulletproof magic. Until now, she dared to calm down and look at the surrounding environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfolding in front of her eyes is a burning composition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place she is in is about the center of hell. The Jena battlefield was plowed several times by the soldiers of both sides in these days, and the body lay like a crop waiting to be harvested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"transmutation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the captain's spell, the wooden flagpole turns into steel. The tip of the wooden pole at the top of the flagpole turned into a gun tip, and it seemed that the nectar could be pierced at any time. It is naturally best to use a long gun to deal with floating and bulletproof enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The premise is that the opponent does not have a flexible tactical mind. Renee did not panic, but greeted the gun tip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thorn stuck across her breastplate, leaving a white scratch. She intercepted the flagpole with her right hand, and the cyan electric spurted out from the palm of her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The electric shock claw (shockinggrasp)!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fierce and decisive electric shock repelled the following Flag bearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door not only let go of the hand, but was also driven back five steps by this current. He wants to reach out and grab the flagpole, but his legs are not listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flagpole that lost the flag bearer fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large flag of freedom fell and hit the ground, giving a heavy metal sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dust is flying. In the smoke, a few crisp glass breaks were heard, and the green mist was mixed in the smoke. This is probably also an early arrangement by the opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Acid Bomb?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seneca group is on the ground, 趁The smoke picked up his own sabre "Humble", and the sword tipped up and turned like a gyro. After using the anti-magic field to dispel all the acid mist, she carefully guarded the enemy opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exceptionally familiar figure. This familiar magical impact. Some nasty and flexible fighting styles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and she both felt an intimate atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young men and women stare at each other, and the pair of revolver guns in their hands are facing each other across the flagpole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you still need to introduce each other?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His right hand is pressing himself just from Marshal Fox The commanding sword that was received there, asked with the last hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she heard this voice, she cut off the last hope and slammed the gun and answered the question word by word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not necessary. Jonica Verin? von Figota, temporary commander of the Imperial Narrows Corps."<br />< </br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man in a free country and a woman in the Holy Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grey-blue general military uniform and lavender general dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweetheart entwined by the rim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upper? You have done a good job recently, the officer is an adult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She does not Call him "Sorlayton." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mothers of each other, distinguished Mr. von Figota."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not Call her "Jenica". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Jena Army’s last reserve team should be in your hands?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp What she means is: If I defeat you, the short history of the Jena will be over here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The nearest rescue team of the Emperor, will it take a few days to get there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;She and he shoulder the lives of thousands of comrades. She and he both shoulder the battle for this war. She and he would have no way to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When summer is about to end, in the middle of the bloody Jena meat grinder, the teenager and the girl are once again jealous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young captain tried to break the deadlock first: "I don't want to fight you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I don't want to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's a good start." The commander's sword of the door slammed the ground. "Can I re-establish the flag?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The flagpole is free." Renee took a step forward and seemed to inadvertently step on the flagpole. "But I will take it away." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I say 'no'?" Naimen took a step forward. His soldiers have already cast their acid bombs and are filling their guns with ammunition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't go to the military court, it's none of my business." Yanika gently fiddled with the magazine of her pistol. "Still call you." Let's go down, I really don't want to cause unnecessary casualties."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers panicked their eyes to their commanders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door nodded, and the right hand’s commanding sword swayed backwards. “She is a genius, it’s right. You are not her opponent. I command you. Retreat - "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfect scorpion. Perfect backwards. He took a deep breath and rushed forward three steps. He sneaked a sneak attack on the sword and shot his right shoulder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"铛". When I have a right hand, I have a "humble" sword ridge that is directly on his offensive line. The two swords touched and shocked him and her arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You haven't changed at all." 黛妮卡 sighed. "It looks cruel, but always ruthless. It's a good guess."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are also merciful. The anti-magic field is still open, Miss General."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't engage What's wrong. I just forgot to turn it off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonyka glanced into the air, and Saphir was still wrestling with her dragon. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her head, humming the name of "humble", her wrists vibrating, shaking the sword of the door, closing the anti-magic effect attached to the sword. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was able to see the magical light that was entangled around her through the detection of magic, and the eyes were slightly stunned by the light. He knows how much magic she has on the opposite side: the serious Jenny, the threat is never less than a sharp company with a full staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 also noticed the light reflected in his pupil, nodded with satisfaction: "I will give you the last chance. You can surrender... Solei顿.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She called the old name. The door is still squinting. His sword is still very close to each other. After the pressure of "humility" disappeared, the magic returned to his side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently shook his head and used the next magic: "animated!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The commanding sword in his hand suddenly softened, shaking like a snake, entangled in the past with the nearest weapon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 was taken aback. The first thought that flashed in her mind was "good disgusting". In the second year, "Soleton actually had two magics?" The third thought was "not good!". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She re-ignited the ability to "humble" again: "There is no law, no nirvana!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic effect in front of her is once again swept away by this sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Almost at the same time as seeing the results, Renee regretted it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Miss General!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was exhausted with all strength, and the two tangled swords were directly grabbed by his brute force! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally used his wisdom and reaction to flatten the gap between the two levels of magic; once the battle was pulled to the stage determined by arm and shooting, he could play Win the Nika. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only the beginning of the phrase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the door throws the sword, catches the "humble" hilt, and begins to read the sentence: "French--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't finish it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I have already rushed into his arms, with a firm and heavy middle elbow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as she couldn’t guess that he would use activating magic, he didn’t guess she would use melee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fierce elbow was blocked by the chest armor hidden under the military uniform, and the strength was great. He took a step back and wanted to go on and read: "No me--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the other side's movements are amazing. By his chance of losing balance, Renee took his front robes and skillfully twisted, pushed, and cast, and the whole movement was done in one go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the door was reacted, he was already lying on the ground, and his body was still suppressed by 黛nica. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell of the perfume on her body broke through the smell of gunpowder and drifted into his consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Nanimen realized that he had not been so close to the real Seneca for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and stared at her, discovering that she was also staring at him. Resist the door to be familiar with the seemingly pitiful, uncompromising eyes. Nana is familiar with the fragrant smell of perfume. It is not the taste she used when she pretended to be an imperial princess, but the taste she used in Lenny's orphanage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cheap lavender aroma is what he gave her. Even if her name has become 黛妮卡薇伦冯费戈塔, she is still the one that he knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one that he is familiar with, will never admit defeat, will not admit mistakes and will not regret the Nika. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must defeat her in order to get back his life and her life. He feels that she should have a life. An ordinary life in Lenny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the door clenched the "humble" hilt and continued the command with a faint voice that could hardly be heard: "Nirvana-"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenica saw his behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slammed her head down and blocked the door-to-door command with her own lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A deep kiss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is entangled with her tongue to make sure that the opponent can no longer use any magic. Neither of them closed their eyes and stared at each other's pupils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yenica feels that she can understand what Naimen’s eyes want to say. He is questioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She initially felt that she could answer with her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after trying to turn a few turns of the eye, licking the eyes several times, and knocking the magician’s code on the other’s tongue with her tongue, she had to It is too complicated to admit that "who made you kiss the princess of the princess last time, this is revenge" and "I will give you the first kiss to make you feel uneasy in happiness." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it may be that the other’s mind is filled with tongue kisses, so it cannot be conveyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If so, you can't communicate it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry. She apologized in her heart and pulled the trigger of the revolver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔哒. no response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She deducted again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔哒. Still no response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stretched out the little finger and the ring finger to explore the magazine, but felt that the other hand was pinching on the magazine of her gun, firmly live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Yanika’s face was burned up, and she was red and blushing. She could see each other's eyes, and there was a smile that saw her thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She and he are only very similar in this unscrupulous way of fighting. I am so familiar, so I can almost always guess the other person's thoughts and conspiracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 was furious and raised her head to break off the kiss and kneel on the lower abdomen of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door does not show weakness, pinching the wheel of the pistol, and she is tweaking on the ground, just like the St. Grace welfare in Lenny The same in the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only difference is that both of them are holding the pistol that can kill the other person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the guns rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two bodies were shocked at the same time, and they both released the hand that caught the gun. The silver pistol fell to the ground and made a dull sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not injured?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two subconsciously spoke at the same time. She snorted with him, reacting to the ridiculousness of the problem and laughing at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The bullet seems to be empty?" asked the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 picked up the pistol and dialed the magazine to see: "It should be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "That is... your first kiss?" Nana thought and thought, but still opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be." Reneka did not raise the gun this time. Like being tired, she sighed and sat down on the flagpole, staring blankly at the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, the shadow of the Black Wing and the Silver Dragon are fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonyka screamed: "Is that Anne? It’s amazing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, that's just the demon that Anne summoned. She should be on the front line in the north." Ningmen replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good." She replied with her own pistol and said, "So I can rest assured."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scream from the air. Resist the door and looked up, only to see the blood network. These dark black blood formed the shape of the magic array in the air, and then turned into a blood fog, and finally slowly dispersed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the blood of the incarnation of the devil. Anne's summoned object was torn by the claws of the silver dragon. Naimen knows that at this moment, the summoner Anne himself will be extremely hurt, feeling the same level of pain as the incarnation of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silver Dragon Mara was also splashed with blood and her wings were covered with scars, but she won. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s an avatar, Anne is really amazing. But even the demon prince may not be the opponent of the silver dragon, don’t say the avatar."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 went to the end of the flagpole and picked up the ragged free flag. She looked at it for a moment, sighed, and the flame on the tip of her right index finger flashed, igniting this great flag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's all over. You have no Master, you can't stop the dragon, and you can't stop me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two fell silent again before the burning flag of freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
