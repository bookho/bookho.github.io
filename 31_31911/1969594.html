			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beginning of that beautiful love story is about the summer of the standard calendar 1657. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summer of that year was not too hot, even in mid-July, but for a young major officer, It was indeed a hot summer. A summer of love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That day, he went to Elona Cathedral as usual to pray. There, he married his goddess, the beautiful seminary girl who came here to train. As a result, the frequency of his visit to the church changed from once a month to once a week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every precious holiday, he will bring a bunch of bright flowers and go there to give her. And she always smiles and accepts the bunch of flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is wonderful, but not always so beautiful, her apprenticeship is over. On that day, like a plain love story, he brought a bunch of bigger flowers and a light white love letter to confess to her; however, she was swearing to give him the answer of the three words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, those who put their mind and body into the arms of God are not qualified to love others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that it is his ability and status is not enough. In order to seek a higher status, the majors have been transferred to the most dangerous field forces; in the same cycle with the Fegota, Soma, and Elf, young people have gradually emerged, and the ranks have risen year by year. He thought that as long as he became a great general and hero, he would be favored by the beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the future, he recalled and found out that it was just an illusion of illusion. In fact, he only hopes that he will always be the major, and then send her a bunch of flowers every week, which is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eight years have passed. When he returned to the city, he found that another man had lived with her...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Di Khao; Woke up and found that he had reached the front door of the St. Grace welfare home. However, the situation has been completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the main entrance of the welfare home, to the front of the middle hall, the charred, electric, slashed, and shot dead bodies are already available. "In countless" to describe. Most of the entire half of the assault troops have been consumed here. Seeing this kind of scene, even if he is in a battle, he will feel some fear. This is fundamentally different from what he envisioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a light enemy, the Major General does not despise the opponent at all - use nearly 100 people to besiege a small, only 15 soldiers, a mage and a pastor According to the courtyard, it cannot be said that it is a light enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Verentina were very familiar, when she was a pastor of Elona rather than a latent. He is against the door; Lopez can't say that he doesn't understand. He has carefully investigated the details of this potential enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Lemda now feels that he does not understand the true strength of these two people. This can only be described as a miracle...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The miracle should not appear twice." He muttered and glanced at the 300 people behind him. The soldiers have strengthened their confidence. Although he is not a mage or a pastor, he is very confident in his beliefs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hundred, that is enough to completely squeeze the magic of two top mages or a dozen ordinary mage. More importantly, these forces are still very organized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, bear the door." The woman put the injured man's hand on his shoulder and supported him to the worship room behind the middle hall. After a hard fight, he and she were a little tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are really partners who have been supporting each other for a long time. They can trust each other at the crucial moment...Hurry up, teacher, there will be no better. Opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tan girl, Nika, looked at him and her back and grabbed her hair. Behind her, the scattered bodies were covered, and the soldiers in the Free Army uniforms fell to the ground. Her magic and fighting talents are undoubtedly inherited from her father; although I do not want to admit it, the qualities of calmness and cold-blooded have indeed inherited a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistance to the door; Lopez, or Zalt; Fran untied the placket and looked at the position of the arrow injury. The curative effect of Verentina is very significant, the blood is no longer flowing, and a layer of faint white light shrouds the wound, making it no longer painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s okay," he replied in a relaxed tone. "The third-rate bow and arrow still can't hurt me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good." Wei Lun laughed. Twenty-nine-year-old, she laughs really nice, Zalt thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been six years... Zalt slowly took out a red box from the inside pocket. The red flannel was slightly stained and he hurriedly wiped it off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Actually, I have something I want you to accept." He took the courage and handed the box over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Lun saw the box and smiled: "How many times is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Probably... about the 100th time?" In fact, even the things inside have been changed many times...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has been a long time... ...I will accept it this time. Now, I can finally be sure that you are more important to me than faith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So ...have you accepted?" Zalt asked with excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virentina’s cheeks were reddish and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! Success!" The wizard bounced off the chair but fell back to the chair because of the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resistance to the door! Don't do this, the wound will delay healing!" Wei Lun reprimanded the tone with a touch of warmth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, Wei Lun, I have been telling you two things since a long time ago. The first one is... I have seen you from me. At first glance, I fell in love with you.” The Master made a deep breath and said with a voice from the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Another piece...in fact, my name Not the door; Lopez. My name is Zalt; Fran, the rebel mage Zalte; Fran. I am sorry to have lied to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Zalte. Well, is a good name, there is no need to hide it?" Wei Lun's expression became embarrassing. "From the first sight I saw you, you know that you have been lying to me. However, I also concealed the fact that I graduated from the seminary... then we are even."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, we're even."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got up and looked close to her beautiful face. The eyes of the two men were handed over, and they were all red on the face and closed their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I love you, Wei Lun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I love you too, endure... ...no, Zalt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight casts on the white god of the treatment goddess Elona, ​​the goddess seems to smile in calmness. The soundproof magic that I have designed by Jenny has given them this temporary calm. The girl decided to rely on her own strength to block more enemy offensives. This man-made calmness is extraordinarily abrupt and extravagant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...dete magic detection"!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only chaplain chasing carefully Behind the guards, throw a spell to detect magic. His vision became pure black and gray, and only one place was different. He took out the standard brightness meter and compared it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Discovering the magic reaction, sir." He reached out and crossed a line in the air, marking the ground on the other side of the yard. "Medium, brightness ten to ten. Second."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Di Khao; Lemda nodded. He is grateful that he still has a complete system and can fight in magically dangerous areas as in the regulations. If the compilation has collapsed, he will not have a pastor to use now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the establishment of the Free Army, three soldiers armed with long guns, long swords and muskets formed a guerrilla battle group. Twelve people can form four battle groups, and they carefully enter the seemingly empty courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before departure, everyone drank the anti-magic potion that was standard equipment of the Free Army. The assault squad must withstand possible traps and magical attacks, and their equipment is the best of all the units - each of them can be equipped with anti-magic potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at his subordinates with some worries in the distance, Major General Lemda is glad that he still has complete equipment available. The opponent has a considerable number of casters. If the equipment has been lost, the soldier's life can only be used to detect the enemy's magical ability and magic margin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assault troops bowed slowly and slowly. The enemy must be hiding somewhere, but they did not fire. Before and after the line, the soldiers in the assault class hesitated, letting only one battle group go in first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it's just moderate strength, it shouldn't be stronger than anti-magic potion..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Just as Lambda thought so, it was awkward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the soldiers in the courtyard screamed fiercely, and the weapons fell off their hands. The huge and heavy voice echoed in the courtyard, sounding like a horrible Warcraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Retreat! If you don’t leave, you’re only dead! This is not an area that you can get close to!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the voice was heard, the soldiers were stunned and looked around for the source of the sound. Then, the fiery flames rose from the empty space of nothing, covering the entire courtyard! The number of flames is not like a fire wall, nor a little magic like a fireball... but a real fire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Immediately withdraw!” Seeing the magical power, Major General’s hand slammed on the wall and shouted, but it was already late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the burning of the flames, continuous explosions sounded. The soldiers in the first combat group flew flesh and blood, and the anti-magic potion did not play any role. The sea of ​​fire began to burn from the place where the magic existed, and it burned to the front door, and suddenly stopped there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can escape from the sea of ​​fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There has been no anti-magic potion, sir." The company commander whispered, "The fire sea...we have to try?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lemda stared at the sea of ​​fire and looked at it for a long while. The intermediate reaction has received feedback that is definitely a high level of magic. This is unlikely...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a trial of the assault, the courtyard returned to calm and the flames disappeared. The new attack has not been launched for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss, your plan looks very effective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwarf Tug sees the hand The torch was burned out, and it was blown out, and the match was lit with another one. He and his team were hidden behind the huge flames and the temporary bunkers, and spy on the enemy's movements from the gaps in the bunker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A moment of efficacies. How much is left in the bomb?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About ten Many times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten many times..." Renee; Lopez sat down on a wooden box full of bombs, holding the chin carefully Calculation. Even if you can solve a class at a time, this amount is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the illusion plus bomb can stop the opponent’s offensive, let them stop and stop... If the middle can repel one or two large-scale attacks, Better. More than ten times is not enough to destroy all the other forces, but it should be enough to weaken the morale of the other side. As long as more support troops arrive, these intentions will be completely defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the support force arrives...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak to herself, she wakes up suddenly . Nickika, what are you looking forward to? Looking forward to the reinforcements... Are you not planning to believe in the father of the idiot? Still, you are deep in your heart, still retaining the trust in that git? The man who does not deserve to be a father...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a magical genius, an illusionist... you have to use your own strength to open up the future, you can't be dragged down by that mixed-ball father. You are first of all, and then Lopez - this last name doesn't matter to you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 speaks to himself and hypnotizes herself. The victorious heart ignited and strengthened her determination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you kill it purely with magic, no matter how strong you are, it will be drained quickly. But no one stipulates that you must use all magic Come kill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She still has a lot of magic... All she has to do is project these magics at the most appropriate time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on." She heard the buzz of the officer's password coming from outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on." She saw the walls on both sides collapse and the crowd came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on." Seventy...eighty? Perhaps more, a large-scale attack. Isn't that what she is looking forward to? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on!" The flames ignited, covering the earth and the sky. This time the enemy did not hold it, but rushed to the inside. Have they seen the illusion? It’s too fast...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Open fire!!” Yanika jerked up and shouted. The artificial flames set off her back, and the pistol magazine in her hand continued to rotate. The dwarves cast bombs at hand and let the gunpowder bombs explode in the center of the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tug looked up and looked at the slim, fragile figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, he remembered another equally heroic and fearless figure, in Ain Tucker, in the Great Wilderness, in the Western Tang Dynasty, in the hustle and bustle, in China. towards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a father who must have a son." He remembered an oriental proverb; in the West, it seems to apply to his daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the enemy opposite does not think so. In front of them, not a young girl in front of me... but a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the bullets hit like a tide, they often hit the mirror. Her figure is like a ghost, under the cover of flames and smoke, and no actual trace can be found. The number of dwarves under her hand is not many, but the resistance is very heroic. With a musket and a short scorpion, the ghosts roll under the cover of the illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't stay here! Kill in!" The commander who commanded the total attack hurriedly ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as soon as the order was over, a sharp blade pierced his throat from the shadows. The girl's eyes were cold and sharp, and the blood was spilled on her leather armor, and there was no hesitation. The two guards chased them, but found that it was just a phantom - a phantom killer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, a gunpowder that was lit by the lead rolled to their feet and exploded. The real girl showed a smile and disappeared into the flames again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if the sergeant dies, the soldiers will not stop charging. Not only because the orders have been issued, but also because they have nowhere to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only way is to rush into the room! Go in safely!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving After a quarter of the bodies and the same number of wounded, they rushed into the hall. What is shown in front of these soldiers is an extraordinarily sacred scene. It is not a small welfare institution main hall, but...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...isn't the main hall of the Great Hall?" A faithful believer exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right, here is the Great Church. Of course, this is not a great church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of 黛nica came from the altar in front of the distance. She wore a white sacred attire and stood proud of the soldiers who came in. Some of the Musketeers couldn’t hold it and immediately lit the fire rope to open fire. But the lead shot hits something that I don’t know, only the sound of "Bu Bu". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it discovered? But it is already late. Ignite!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s finger pointed at the big explosion at the door. All the gunpowder that was originally covered by the illusion was exploding at the same time. The storm with the nails slammed on the surrounding walls, nailed to the invisible furniture, hit the soldiers, leaving endless blood and minced meat. Seeing this scene, even the dwarves who have fought in battle can't help but bow their heads and vomit. This is not a fight...but a massacre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Janica; Lopez has no time and mood to vomit, she is busy estimating the number of enemy deaths...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eight... ten... twelve... thirteen. Thirteen classes will not be more. The rest... Where is the rest? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer appears instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you looking for us, respectable Miss General? Your battle is so wonderful, even I can't help but applaud. Oh... this great church It’s true.” Di Khao; Lymda slammed in the middle of a row of seats in the Great Hall – of course, it was the original side door of the middle hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 didn’t talk nonsense with him, his hand flashed, it’s six shots. The bullets that were not used before were all poured in the direction of the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Unfortunately, the bullets all flew. The girl noticed that the only bullet that was hit was unexplained by something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general will not move, steady as the mountain range: "Miss, wait, wait a second. Look at my captives, how?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His hand waved, and the remaining 100 soldiers all poured into the narrow middle hall. Among them, the hostess and the children of this place are mixed. There was no injury to both Zalt and Weilun - it is clear that Lymda used the same hostage means as the present. After seeing Monica, he and her looked at each other and smiled in response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of 黛nica became blood red in a flash. Not shy, but angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you avoid my backyard alert?! I should have alarm magic on all walls..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For a well-equipped company, that's nothing. We still have a broken magic roll, and good weapons should be used on the blade." Di Khao; Mda glanced at the room and saw the flesh and blood and sighed. "It’s a terrible death... As an opponent, I want to pay a little respect to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No need to fake, I surrender is." The card looked at the teacher and the nun and looked at the children again, lowering the high head. She is holding a gun and throwing herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Miss, I will allow you to keep the 'symbolic' weapon." Dico; Lymda promised, "relative, as long as You can do all the magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛尼卡bited the teeth and put the gun back in the holster, and took the ridicule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, you have to let go of the collapse. After seeing your fighting power, I dare not look down on you." Lemda added. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...well." Renee took back all the illusions and turned the surroundings back into a fire, burning and rundown welfare home. Her hand trembled, but it was powerfully raised and pointed to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collecting magic is the most basic method of magic practice. Generally, it is gathered first and then slowly recovered. But if you gather magic, then let go, it is the most The direct venting power of efficiency. This magic is called "pure energy" and is the basic skill of all magic, but almost no one will use it - unless it is to cause unstoppable damage. Pure energy flame can be used to penetrate any property wall or magic resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 tried to gather his magic at his fingertips and become a dazzling silver light. Silver light groups are getting bigger and bigger, more and more eye-catching, and more and more dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Great." Both hands were tied behind Zalt; Fran's eyes widened. He still doesn't know that his apprentice already has this amazing power - that is even better than his own limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renee shouted out the mantra and let the huge and dazzling silver light hit the air. This mantra contains the unwillingness and obsession of the girl. Silver light penetrates the roof and bursts in the clouds of the night sky, dazzling and dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great." Even Dico; Lymda, can't help but praise the power of this magic, "Go ahead."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver light that bursts in the air bursts open in the air, even on this night, it seems a bit unusual. People turned their heads and looked at the direction of the silver light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because sister Anne; Sefer gave the welfare home extra money, so Verentina could get enough money to buy the welfare home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Verentina bought the welfare home, the children were able to be Dicoo; Lymda was taken hostage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of Krad; Lopez's perfect plan, Bonnie would want to solve the problem of undead in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Bonnie; Sefer solved the undead and caused a counterattack, Dico; Limda will have a fully compiled unit to break through the defense of the welfare home . In the original history, he should have been defeated there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of all of the above, Di Khao; Lemda can break through the welfare home and avoid the fate of defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of all of the above, Dico; Lemda can get the hostages he wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of all of the above, it is possible for the Major General to resist the attack by Clade; Lopez's attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of all of this, Radz; Govar is likely to gain the command of the 10th Division. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of all of this, the undead will ravage the entire Lenny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the humble young Sorelton just woke up and stood outside the cathedral looking at the familiar pure flame. He glanced in his heart, rushing in that direction despite the faint pain of his left arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Anne; Seifer has extinguished the fire on the seventh street, watching the strange silver flame in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Bonnie; Sefer was fighting in the laneway of the North City with the undead creatures chasing her. She also saw the silver light in the distance, and the corner of her mouth showed a chuckle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirteen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, as a hostage, Verentina and Zalt are looking helplessly to see their disciples emptying the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Clade; Lopez is working with his adjutant Hull to speed up the pace to the place where the silver light is emitted. He certainly knows that it is there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Radz; Geval has already finished halfway. He looked at the silver flame in the air and unconsciously accelerated his pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
