			<div id="content">Let's vent your resentment first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starting point of the uploading system is really strange, the problem has not been broken, and finally opened a bloody road to create a new book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, I finally made up my mind to start digging this new pit. In fact, it is not clear that it is a new pit: the theme of this pit, that is, "the evolution from the ordinary fantasy magic world to the magical science world", was long before I started writing "gun, blood rose, Necromancer". Conception. As for the idea of ​​writing a prequel, it’s been at least a year. The rumor of “Foot Rose·Afterglow” is the result of the earliest attempt...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, I I only realized a truth: with my ability, I have to dig this pit, but I am still far from enough. After reading countless books, as an author, I finally improved from "a little know that I am making garbage" to "determine that I know that I am making garbage." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it has been dragged until now. so troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of conceiving this pit left me with countless bleak memories... At least the main outline of the four major overhauls, the various materials piled up in the mountains, and then repaired Can be listed separately as a set of TRPG rules... I was once ready to start writing (well, yes, it was when I posted all the previous serials on the Internet six months ago), and then because of certain things, the outline was I hit the slag myself, and all overturned it... So the last book was announced, the outline was changed, and even the names were changed... I am sorry to everyone here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process can actually be called "The Death of a Perfectionist." The worst thing is that until now, it is far from the author's wild vision, but the author's ability will stop here. I finally decided the story of this version, no matter how good or bad it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This story is based on the original "Afterglow" article. However, the "Afterglow" version is the history of the original setting, and this "StormyButterfly" version is the history of the new settings, the details and settings are quite different. All the history that appeared in the "Necromancer" may change with the dancing of the butterfly; the words of the historians of the later generations are completely unbelievable. The author originally intended to write only a few pre-posts composed of long and medium-length articles. As a result, the structure of the concept was expanded and expanded, and finally it had to be expanded into continuous articles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn’t require the reader to read the bad predecessor, it’s an independent story – of course, the characters are not independent, even with the previous ones. Wan Hao's contact. As for the development of the main plot, it is the same as the title: history is chaotic, even if it is just the dance of butterfly wings... The development of the plot is very jumping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I know that time travel is very cliché and boring. Other settings in the works, similar to the Eastern Taoism, Feijian, and the New World slavery, are also very clichés, and they are very tempting readers' disgusting settings - it is always reminiscent of liberating slaves, unifying the mainland, Magic Wu double xiu and the like. But this is such a fantasy work. If that is something that my historical logic must have, I will not shy away. It is also not a work about changing history – even if someone surpasses time and space, those people will not make steelmaking irons; because of these conditions, the era itself already exists, all that is needed is a change that fits them. . There will also be Chinese-style political and diplomatic struggles in the works. Because this is an era of change - from the low-devil world to the high-devil world, it can't be a purely easy adventure. Of course, I promise that there will never be a smashing plot of excessive Chineseization, and at most there will be only a break and a marriage succession war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the author's old habits, there are many female characters. I hope that the shaping of the characters will be stronger than before... However, the authors at this point have no confidence at all. The only thing you don't have to worry about is probably the gorgeous magic battle. The number of action plays is definitely great, and almost every chapter will have a gorgeous showdown, um. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: If you are familiar with the history of the parallel world globe, there may be some names in the book that you will find familiar with (the author is too lazy to name), that is The author pays tribute to the names that drive the times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Small Secret: The reason why the name is called ButterflyinStorm is actually to pay tribute. Please spell the first letter yourself.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, special thanks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
