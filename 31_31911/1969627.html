			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of busy work, first release a character rumor, this time put the emperor Gustav; Hugh; Keman, wait for me to slow down from overtime Come and say...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-preludestorm<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summer solstice has passed, but Steelburg has Still no trace of coolness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The towering walls, the arrowholes covered with moss, the bright artillery, the languid soldiers, everything is exposed to the direct sunlight in summer Even the strongest magician can't make it cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gustav; Hugh; Keman hides in the shade of the courtyard, avoiding the hot summer sun, looking for the shackles of the earth. Not far away, the gardeners were busy under the scorching sun. They cut off those young new branches without mercy, in order to make the branches grow more luxuriant trunks. Only these workers can let Prince Gustav recall the palaces in the far north and the beautiful flower beds in the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hates summer, and this heavily guarded fortress. Since the outbreak of this war, he only returned to the capital of DeLand with his father in the winter for two or three months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prince! Prince! It's a sword!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His swordsman, Span Feng; Sir Allen’s slightly old voice rang in the sword field in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gustav looked around and found that he had escaped at least four times in each hidden place. This is not the Royal Palace of DeLand. There are only a handful of places where you can hide a 10-year-old prince. After comparing a few houses and a small courtyard, the future emperor made a decisive, great decision: to hide in the map cabinet of the deduction room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tactical deduction room has been empty in recent weeks, and the knights and nobles who gathered here have rushed to the far south. The biggest map hangs on the wall, painted with red and blue arrows that he can't understand, and uses charcoal to write a variety of "grass", "attack points", "combat lines" and other scribbles. The prince opened the door and used the short sword to open the spider web in the corner of the cabinet and hide behind the map scrolls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prince! Prince!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Sir Allen is getting closer. Gustav held his breath and huddled. As long as you have been away for ten minutes, you can continue to grab...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Feng; Sir Allen, Gustav disappeared again?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Prince! Sorry, I am incompetent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince’s heart is tight, knowing that he can’t escape today. It is. The slow and resolute voice is his uncle, Prince Drestein, the strongest enemy he has ever encountered in his nearly eight years of hide-and-seek career. Sure enough, it didn't take long for his fateful opponent to open the door of the map cabinet and effortlessly lifted him out of the cupboard with his collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Gustav, remember to check if the spider web is outside the cabinet next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle is good." Gustav was busy following the "aristocratic etiquette" and returned to the Prince for a half-departure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the standard half-departure ceremony, the prince’s eyebrows were twisted and he chiseled the prince’s forehead: “Gustav, you How many days have you not attended class? Etiquette, swordsmanship, magic, theology, literature, every teacher is looking for me to complain. Are you like to be the next emperor? Today, let me personally check you The learning results are good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince immediately put on a bitter face: "Uncle..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Begging for mercy is useless." Direstein slammed the wooden sword from Sir Spence's hand and carried Gustav to the swordfield. The prince took the wooden sword from his uncle and shivered and gestured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two swords are staggered in the air, just making a soft bang, and the prince’s wooden sword falls to the ground with a red mark on the right wrist. He wanted to scream, but when he saw his uncle's face full of helplessness, he slammed the sound into his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Swallowing? West?" The prince who escaped a few literary lessons squinted innocently, apparently did not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Gustav’s prince like this, the prince who wanted to talk about it shook his head and turned to the side of the jazz: "Take him an afternoon, no For lunch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Span had not had time to plead with the prince, and Dirstein strode out of the swordfield. The swordsman coach and interim manager had to smile at the prince and spread the stall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, sorry. This is the order of the Prince."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As usual The nuisance prince had to be in a confinement room to daze and fight against the magic book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- So far, this is the usual day in Steelburg. Everyone has nothing to do with the prince's mischief and inferiority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until only half an hour later, Span; von; Allen hurriedly released him from the confinement room - or, please, came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, please go to the main hall of the main fort, the Prince is looking for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When When Gustav heard the title, he vaguely felt that things were wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of a thunderous sound from the outer city is the sound of the artillery shell on the temporary defense magic barrier. There are two or three bursts in the boring thunder, which means that somewhere the defense has been broken. These voices have been heard every day since the strikers of the Rebels arrived at Fort Stilburg two weeks ago; but today’s bursts seem to be particularly high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gustav walks on the gravel path leading to the main hall. Every knight and nobleman's face was covered with gloom, and when he saw him passing by, he slammed back to the side and bowed. He noticed familiar faces that had not been seen for months, and they often had blood on their armor. The prince's heart is getting more and more heavy - all this is just one thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That thing he can guess, but can’t ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Priest Drestein has already waited at the entrance of the main hall, the pupils are red, and there are tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle...I don't want to go." Gustav felt the heavy atmosphere and tried to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must go. You can't hide in the shadow of others forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derry Stan pulled him into the hall indiscriminately, exposed to the people in the hall and exposed to the empire, the vassals, the generals, the generals and the knights. Almost everyone stood up and bowed to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at that moment, Gustav did not see anyone, nor heard any voice. There is only one thing in his eyes, in his ears, in his heart, the heavy thing that cannot be circumvented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a spiritual pivot placed in the middle of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thirty-second emperor of the Second Dynasty of the Holy Coman Empire, his father Orestein; Hugh; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An iron-gray cross banner, covering the top of the spiritual pivot, forever emperor who is energetic, unsmiling, and dedicated to his great conquest The seal is inside. Under the banner, the wooden board of the simple coffin was faintly covered with thick dust. The rhetoric of two years ago still seems to be in the ears, but the emperor can no longer wake up; neither the pastor nor the doctor can bring this fragmented body back to life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the gods accommodate his soul, and may his body rest forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the prayers of the dead, the prince’s knees were soft and quietly stumbled before the coffin. In the midst of it, Gustav vaguely heard that his uncle was speaking to all nobles and generals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We all know that the rebels have attacked the fortress, and now is not a time for red tape. I propose that here we are to the thirtieth empire Three emperors, Gustav; Hugh; Koman’s pledge of allegiance. Start with me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, Direstein; Hugh; Prince Coman, swearing allegiance to Gustav. I will try my best to assist His Majesty and the Holy Empire until the end of life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In an instant, every corner of the hall, every crevice is filled with the harsh sound of metal collision. Almost everyone kneels down on one knee and presses their chest to pay tribute to their future emperor and swear allegiance. Only the eleven-year-old emperor was scared by this scene, and he did not know what to do at one time; but he quickly calmed down, remembered the aristocratic education he had received in the past, and began his empire as an emperor with a childish voice. The first speech. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, Gustav; Hugh; Coman, as the emperor of the Holy Coman Empire, accept your allegiance to me here."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the Empire! Long live Gustav emperor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some messy responses, but the volume is Very large, piercing the roof and ringing the entire castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the cheers subsided, Prince Dylistan stood up and said: "So, I am in the capacity of the third heir to the royal family, according to the 'Magna Carta', here In the case of an emergency and the emperor's underage, he served as the regent king and handled the current war affairs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people nodded. In the case of the emperor's underage, it is indeed the provisions of the Magna Carta that the most appropriate royal family member is the regent, and no one has any objections. However, the regent’s speech was shocked by everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the current situation, I believe that we must negotiate with the rebels outside the city, at all costs."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of this sentence, at least two or three people stood up violently, and their armor was decorated with striking family patterns, shrouded in various magical halos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dirstein! Are you going to give up revenge for the emperor? I will never talk to the rebels!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first objection was the Duke of Noor, whose figure was slightly blessed, and his armor was decorated with the coat of arms of the forest. The Principality of Noor is the closest to the forest of the elves on the rich coast of the northwestern empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dirstein shook his head: "His Duke, I can understand your desire to avenge your two sons. Unfortunately, half of your vassals are buried. On the outskirts of Rama, one third of them are sleeping in Gistov. I don't know which family's forces are going to fill the muzzle of the rebel army?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, I will use my people to silence their muzzles forever! Cannes can not tolerate the shame of defeat, we still have the strength to fight!" Immediately after standing up is the original The old Duke of Figota, who served as a post-prince mission, knew that he was the lord of the Great Plains in the southeast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have experience with the Duke? Are your soldiers not on the Eastern Front? It’s just a third-rate mercenary." Relentlessly sneering and refuting, "How about your team's record against the enemy forwards in the two weeks of combat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear this question The face of the Duke of Fegota turned white. Another Duke, the Duke of Soma, who had the rich land of the southwest, got up and said: "I agree with the views of His Royal Highness. For this war, we have paid too much, we can no longer risk losing more. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Duke Soma, when did you become a coward? You are obviously responsible for the defender and the Western Front, and now you are defeated, do you want to surrender?" The Duke of Noel retorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not that I want to surrender, but the way we build these fortresses is outdated! High walls, thick bricks, arrow holes, no more than the opponent's new artillery Anything. We are just dragging the time with magical defenses. We have no chance of winning the artillery!" The Duke of Soma, who had been responsible for defending Fort Stilburg, was blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire funeral venue was quiet for a time, only three dukes and a prince were squatting. Gustav recovered from the sorrow, look at the left side, look at the right side, and some are at a loss. At this time, a young voice came in and broke the silence. It was a sound that sounded calm and credible, but full of sultry taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the Magna Carta, we should now seek the opinions of the emperor. Whether or not to take revenge for Olestan, naturally, Gustav has the most say. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man waved his hand violently. "Everyone here who has just sworn allegiance to his majesty will swear to follow his Majesty's decision! Whether it is to become a captive of the enemy, or to die for honor, we Swear to follow your banner!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing these words, the regent's brows wrinkled more and more tightly. He came over and seemed to want to say something to the young emperor, but Gustav could not hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young emperor only heard - the tide of cheers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young emperor only saw -- looking for the fiery eyes in the eyes of the vassals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live your majesty! Long live!! Wanwanai!!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot blood on the prince In the brain, he walked quickly to the coffin and picked up the scepter that was pressed against it. On the golden scepter, there are carved complex patterns and three ancient letters of h.k.e. A symbol of the sacred Coman Empire, a golden scepter named "great power." The tip of the scepter crossed a circle in the air, and the golden light shone through the audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the name of Gustav; Hugh; Coman I, I choose...vengeance!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the regent’s body trembled and reluctantly closed his eyes; but he quickly recovered his judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, are you going to break out and still fight with the enemies of the South?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it is a dead battle!" Someone immediately replied loudly. All the young knights, especially those who have stayed in Steelburg, also echoed aloud: "Decisive battle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, just in front of us There is a road to victory. We must attack each other's artillery array, but..." Direstein pondered and looked around with the embarrassing eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young nobleman approached him with his right hand and pressed his right hand to his chest: "His Royal Highness, our Fergota army is willing to undertake this task! We There is the best magical force in the country!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then hand it to you." The Regent nodded and noticed the coat of arms on his armor. "Are you the heir to the Duke of Figota?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young nobleman nodded: "I am Loren; von; Lord Fegota." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your agitation ability is really good. Maybe you should go to the South, it is more suitable for you than here." Direstein lowered his voice, with a disgust in his tone "You should be clear about the choices you make."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe, but I just want to do what I think is right. Let me surrender, I do Not!! The future Duke of Fegota answered with confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, I hope you can remember what you said." The Regent sighed softly, turned and left, leaving a slightly wrong Young Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepared for two days before the war. The reconnaissance units and intelligence units of both sides are busy and busy preparing for the inevitable war. Numerous flying beasts, reconnaissance magic and scout squadrons fluttered inside and outside the fortress, causing hundreds of casualties and captives in two days. The original limited supply of bread became an infinite supply, the wine in the wine cellar was divided, and all the gold coins were sent to the soldiers. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the black challenge flag re-emerged at the top of the empire’s first fortress high wall, as proud as the demonstrations of the enemy forces under the city. The leading troops of the Freedom Army outside the city did not hesitate to send an accurate shot there, and the façade and the flag above were wrecked into wreckage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new ten-year-old emperor crosses his love horse "magic wind", this two-year-old gray horse is his birthday gift when he was seven years old. Its front hoof is black, its heel is red, and it obviously has the blood of some kind of magical beast, so it got this loud name: the magic wind is the biggest natural disaster known to mankind, and it is a hurricane with magical power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, he will ride the grown-up "magic wind", galloping on the land of the empire, becoming a generation of famous kings - at least, everyone is Tell him this way. The Imperial Emperor is the ultimate arbiter of the human world, the defender of all justice and equality, the defender of his subjects, a handsome, tall, heroic and wise man. However, when Gustav I was really in the upcoming team, he felt that he was very small. The mounts around everyone are so tall, the armor is so bright, and his "ruler of the human world" is so inconspicuous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...if we fail, Protestants and rebels in the South will enter our capital and hinterland, and the small lords of all places will be ready to move. The dark ages will repeat itself. Waiting for us is returning home, or another era of war. All depends on our battle today. If the situation is unfavorable, I hope that you can guard your Majesty to break out; if you unfortunately evolve into the worst situation, I hope that you can maintain the last blood of the royal family with the same loyalty and enthusiasm, Olivia Her Royal Highness. As for myself, I will live with you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grammar he used was too difficult for Gustad, who had not studied literature in peacetime. The husband heard a dizzy feeling. The battle has already begun before the emperor understands the meaning of these words. This is not a breakout, but a gamble. A gamble that used the entire empire as a bet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party has apparently used low-altitude flight units and detective magic to measure their actions. At least eight or more regiments are waiting in front of them. They symbolize "freedom." The four-color cross flag flutters above the formation. In the distance, these rebel forces are just peasants and citizens wearing variegated military uniforms, and their equipment appears so ridiculous in front of the two wars that have been fighting for two years. The siege guns are no longer roaring, because such difficult-to-position weapons cannot be used in battlefields. On the outskirts of Steelburg, it was so quiet for the first time in two weeks. The artillery of the rebel army pushed a three-pound and six-pound light artillery into the front of the gate, waiting for the arrival of the enemy on the wilderness plain outside the south gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nor Army Attack! Soma Army Attack!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dukes have ordered, the garrison of the fortress The two most elite teams in the left and right wing of the battleship emerged from the south gate of the fortress, rushing to the other side's main force and stopping outside the limit range of the artillery. The first few rows of soldiers took the old tower shield that had been turned out from the depths of the fortress and had a hundred years of history, forming a solid defense front. Seeing the amazing tower shield wall with the light red magic light, no one fired at the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fergota Army attack! Guards attack!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regent King and Fego The Duke of the Tower also issued an order. The backbone of the Fergota army was lined up with nearly a hundred arrays of assault infantry with a width of ten columns and a depth of twenty rows, starting from the main entrance of the fortress. The Guards Cavalry Army, as the ultimate cavalry force, followed them as a reserve for the entire array. Seeing such a battle, there was another commotion in the enemy. The top rows of soldiers, nervously whispering their heads, took the spear from behind, placed it at their feet, and prepared to replace the musket in their hands at any time. The giant eagle and the cockroach were the first to be dispatched, and the fireworks signal was also ignited. Several horses were riding between the array of rebel forces, and there were also three north, east and west gates heading for the fortress. The two sides are more than patience on the plains of the south of this huge city. In the face of firearms and mobile artillery, it takes a lot of courage to launch an assault. In the end, it was Kemandi who launched the first hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two-wing infantry marching forward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 10,000 infantrymen are listed in a square Number, equipment and confidence as a weapon for death, bravely embarked on the journey. The nobility lined up at the end, supervising the courage of these soldiers. On the opposite side of them, they are the Free Army soldiers who are also listed in a wide frontal formation. They also use their numbers, equipment and confidence as their own shield. Soon, the soldiers shouted slogans, entered the range of the artillery, and entered the range of the arquebus...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers crossed the range line in a row , fire, load, and fire again until it falls. When an entire company was unable to maintain the front, they grabbed spears, swords, and hand axes with other soldiers, launched a white blade charge, and then fell down - until the total number could not maintain the front, or array It was broken by the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first to be broken was the tower shield of the left-wing Soma Army, who was torn into three segments by the white blade of the two groups opposite. The Soma army is not not good at war, but their strength can no longer maintain order in chaos. Seeing the left wing tangled up, the peasants and citizens of the military uniforms went deep into the position, and the regent squad sent a commander to the Figota army with trepidation and ordered all the surviving artillery to fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the whole army, the formation of the right rotation is a horizontal team, each line is separated by ten meters!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; This order spreads out in the battle, and the thickest central unit of the emperor begins to act. The elite troops, mainly sacred knights and magic knights, were transferred out to form a breakthrough team, with the aim of using magic to break through obstacles and obstacles placed by the opponent. The huge number of mercenaries in the Fegota public as the backbone, following the avant-garde cavalry in a wavy formation, paved the way for the final total assault lineup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Central Army, ready to move forward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the command of the Regent, the precious sacred knights and magic knights attacked. Every priest or magician has at least ten guards to defend their safety, so this commando has a total of nearly a thousand. According to the plan, they first approached the enemy's left wing, which was attacking the Soma army. It only took a quarter of an hour to defeat the other company's three companies, and one pair of the free army's breakthrough troops. Seeing their actions, the outstanding enemy generals immediately mobilized the left-wing reserve team to fill the breakthrough, and mobilized the light artillery and reserve team to fill the left-wing force vacancies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's now! Fegota Army, all the charge!" After the other party's transfer order has been passed, the young nobleman Loren; Feng; Lord Fegota Raised the banner of the family and launched a real offensive. After the <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, the total charge began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the history of wars throughout the Old World, in terms of the single-day single-day storm force, this "Fergota Charge" is by far the largest. No charge can compare with this. In this narrow battlefield of only five kilometers, there will be a total of 21,000 infantry and more than 6,000 cavalry in the charge, leaving no reserve team - although, in this century, this battle The strength record can only be ranked seventh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the first time Gustav I had heard the smell of war, and it was his unforgettable memories. This charge made him unforgettable and unforgettable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"dispel dispels magic!" The obstacles and temporary thorns set by the Freedom Wizards were swayed by the Holy Knight's Holy Power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"flame wave!" The purpose of the flame magic is not to kill the enemy, but to disrupt the array of enemy spearmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"defear (fear)!" The devil's roar echoed in the ears of the Freedom Army soldiers, only the civilian soldiers who had heard the pastor preached and fled in panic. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the combined magical attack, the Freedom Army Intresat in the red uniform was unscrupulously torn. They left a huge gap in the middle of the battlefield, exposing the artillery positions to the emperor. The troops of the Duke of Figota were invaded, and after killing the spearman, they smothered the musketeers who only had daggers and short swords. Soon, the soldiers from the far southern island countries collapsed and fled to the sides in a group. Even the generals of the division were attacked by a magic knight in the chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gustav tried to control the horse, following the cavalry that expanded the gap. As a ten-year-old boy, he has almost no fighting ability; but with the golden scepter representing the supreme authority of the Holy Empire, it is not dangerous for life. This "power", as its name suggests, is an artifact-level magic item. If used properly, it can form a powerful attack power field. Even if it is not used, it can produce a protective wall that can block the general bullet flow. The Regent was on his side, holding a telescope and observing the battle. Since the official start of the battle, the actions of each unit have been controlled by the main officer of the unit. There are no more squadrons running around. He seems to be a lot of leisure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle, what's the situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So far, it's still good. However, It seems that they have mobilized new troops on the top, and the action is really fast. If you don’t know the command of the enemy, it’s Conti; Fox is Radz; Govar?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; rather than saying that Dirstein is explaining to the young emperor, it is better to say that he is talking to himself. The war lasted for three years, and the Regent King had already known the leaders of the southern enemy. The artillery and sniper tactics were used to control the force's breakthrough, while the new troops that reorganized the defeated troops filled the gap. They are dressed in off-white and tan uniforms, which are typical of the Rusher Mountain Army and are easy to fight in the snow and mountains. The number of this unit is too familiar to the emperors who have been trapped in Steelburg for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The First Division, Steelburg! Break through them and let this contempt for our number disappear from the enemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Duke of Figota screamed and vented the anger of the enemy’s army for more than two years. All the divisions of the Freedom Army are the names of the republics, but only the number of the first division is the name of the empire. His son immediately picked out more than a dozen companies from the army and ordered them to continue to suppress the broken red division, and then rushed to the line of defense of the new enemy with all the rest. The Lord still has nearly 13,000 well-organized soldiers and the morale of the Second Division of the Free Army. Each of the commanders on both sides clenched their fists and sipped their own artillery and magicians, allowing them to concentrate all their energy on this line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first division and the commander of the Fort Stilt Army, Radz; Major General Govarr rode the horse and swiftly passed through his array, reorganizing the squad and inspiring the soldiers. He is so close to the front line that the sound is so high that even the Emperor can hear it. The morale of the entire Stilburg division was spurred, and the soldiers and the army mages were shrunk in the only bunker - behind a stone wall at the foot of the mountain, waiting for the arrival of the enemy. However, these voices made the aristocrats of Figota feel that they could not stand on their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be afraid of the call of the heretics, the gods will protect us!" "The warriors who are loyal to the emperor, march with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the Lord, the nobles and knights rushed to the front of the array, and also boosted morale. Finally, those emperor infantry dressed in thick skin and armor shouted the slogan "Long live the emperor" and rushed to the stone wall of the Freedom Army - this is the last line of defense before the artillery position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, they don’t have enough magic users to clear them. The commando team has been drowned in the enemy. Although there are still more than half of the survivors, it takes time to reorganize them. This time, the magical advantage fell into the hands of the free army of scattered deployment support magicians. The Freedom Army’s artillery fired with the positioning of the army’s mage, and the artillery shells landed in the middle of the entire team’s Fingota infantry. They quickly proved that the knowledgeable citizens were better artillery than the noble gunners who were pampered, and that the artillery of the emperor no longer sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading rain falls and runs through the wilderness. Nitrogen winds face, refreshing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fergota have strength and courage - but they don't have muskets, no artillery, no magic. Only a few infantry rushed through the stone wall, but they were not immediately shot or captured. One after another aristocrats led their own private soldiers to rush forward, but they could not reverse the situation. The old Duke of Figota was seriously injured in the battle, and the Lord had to reluctantly send a commander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cavalry! We need cavalry! Give us cavalry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing such hoarseness The request, the Regent King froze for a moment. He seems to be trying to throw out "what did you do earlier?!" or "I am always more tricky than the enemy!" The words of swearing responded, but in the end, reason still defeated anger. Direstein cast the final bet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Total reserve team, go forward! The emperor and I are with you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperial The strongest and last cavalry team finally got out. Most of them are veterans who have retreated from the southern front, including a large number of magic users. They are well equipped and used to deal with the Freedom's spear-firearm compound square. The last three magicians who mastered the magic of the earth and stone field rushed to the front of the array, destroying the stone walls at the expense of life. Guardian knights, liberation knights, trial knights, and medical knights followed behind them and rushed into the array of enemy forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A total of three rows of spearmen, after which there are only fire rope gunners! After rushing, the enemy will be cut like a cake! We will win ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Regent King shouted, grabbing the "power" from the side of the blind man, waving and rushing out of a bloody road. Losing Gustav suddenly felt a nausea and worry, but fortunately a guardian knight caught up and added a protective magic to him, alleviating his uneasiness. His knight, following the bloody road of "power", stepped on the enemy's spearmen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A row! Two rows! three rows! The cake was finally cut. At this moment...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Upper bayonet!" Stewart's commander, Radz; Gowal issued such an order. The musketeers took out their short knives and inserted them in their guns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This small change slowly and unstoppably changed the situation on the battlefield. The shining bayonet is facing the knights who rushed over, stabbing their mounts, trapping the captives of the fallen horses and capturing them. The farthest knight, who was less than a hundred meters away from the artillery position, was poked by three bayonet. The artillery that had been replaced with a shotgun re-roated, thousands of horses and a larger number of people fell into a pool of blood, and most of them quickly died of lead poisoning and excessive blood flow, and could not wait for the pastors. Treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Regent King himself eliminated nearly one company with the power of "power", but eventually fell off the horse. The hillside a few hundred meters away looked so close, and the charge was so far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A negligible technical improvement determined the outcome of the "Fergota Charge" and ended the entire war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The queue of captives is very long and can’t be seen at a glance. Gustav clung to his scepter, next to Uncle Regent, and headed for the "Rebel Army" - now the victorious Free Army. Along the way, the civilians in the south were surprised to look at him in the distance and point to something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We captured the 610 aristocrats from the Gustav emperor and the Regency Supreme Regent, and killed the 10,000 of the Dukes of Figota. The two nobility. In addition to the loss of the former Olestan, it is conservatively estimated that the emperor could not return to today's scale within ten years..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headquarters is established Within a farmer's mansion, less than two kilometers from Steelburg. A staff officer is reporting to the top commander about their victory. Hearing the contents of the report, the regent's mouth twitched, but did not say anything. A guard opened the door of the command for the two, and the report inside was terminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Colonel Lopez, later." The highest commander of the Freedom Army is a middle-aged man with a lot of white hair. He has five shoulders. Big star. He let the colonel leave with his report and turned to the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Gustav and His Royal Highness, it is a pity that we met in this situation. Fortunately, the two noblest nobles Not killed by our barbaric hard work, dirty citizens and awkward farmers. Let me introduce myself first, I am the chairman of the Freedom Army Staff Conference, Conti, Marshal. "The marshal, who looks older than the real age, faintly sneers. "The barbaric labor, the dirty citizens and the peasant farmer" are the most commonly used words in the empire to describe the Southern Freedom Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Regent King replied bitterly; "Since we lose, the conditions are up to you. However, the strength of the empire is not entirely here, the blood of the royal family is not only Only on the two of us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, we will not ask the empire to give up the system, or ask Delan to be the Republic. After all, we It’s just because of your aggression.” The marshal laughed and went to the table and picked up a document. “Our parliament has already drafted the draft, just waiting for your approval.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Regent took the paper and took a sigh of relief: "Steelburg, the middle reaches of the Oslo River and the entire Champagne region? Your parliament is too greedy."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conti; Fox smiled slyly: "I don't want you to say that there are a lot of radical members in Lenny now, demanding that the war criminals be severely punished. Orestein is already dead in Keng Outside the city, but I think they should not mind going to negotiations with Queen Olivia and . Matters "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; regent clenched his fists, teeth, and gazed at the opposite has" Kenge Le Fox "famous nickname. If his eyes are magical weapons like the eyes of Medusa or the eye of death, I am afraid that Marshal Fox has died 10,000 times. But now, Dirstein has no chips at hand, and can only use the "power" to press the seal on the document. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can be the master of Steelburg and the lower reaches of the River Oslo, but I can't do it in the Champagne region. That is the territory of the Principality of Fegota. The Duke of Fegota promised..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another voice came from outside the room: "Oh, then the person who needs the singer is here. Go in, kid. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radez; General Govard escorted the bloody Lord Fergota into the house. The winner is in high spirits, and the loser is dejected. The young aristocrat who shouted slogans in Stillburg a few days ago is now soft on the ground like a pool of unconscious mud. The free army around them have smirked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness...Sorry, I am wrong." Loren; von; Fegota sees Dylistan, back in twilight One step, but was stopped by Govar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The new Duke of the Duke, do you have any objections to the ownership of the Champagne region?" The commander of Steelburg's division went straight into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...No." Loren squeezed these words out of his teeth and replied as a reply. Soon, the guard took the ring from his father's body and pressed it on the surrender book. The young Duke looked intricately from the enemy's generals and took the ring. He turned away and his figure was very lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing this request, Dirstein's aristocratic demeanor collapsed at that moment. He violently grabbed the "power", held his head high and went straight down! With this huge high-speed force field, it will be emitted from the tip of the scepter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but "Kegler's Fox" is faster than him. While a lead bolt tore his left ear, at least six spears forced him and Gustav. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dirstein; Hugh; Coman! Admit defeat, you are no longer eligible to bargain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Regent King’s knees were soft, and the force field hit the air and flew over the roof. The scepter in his hand was unable to fall underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the regent who had to hand over the scepter, the future Gustav the Great first understood: courage, self-confidence and stubbornness, changes in the times In the face of powerful power, it is so weak. It is impossible to win by the gorgeous words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that we can conclude a peaceful treaty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Marshal , took over Fort Steele. There were only over 20,000 people left in the 100,000 emperors before the war. After surrendering all the weapons and armor, they embarked on their way home with their coffins and wounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gustav; Hugh; Emperor Coman finally took a look at Steelburg and the trees in the yard. The gardener had already sacrificed in the previous siege war, and a few young branches had re-emerged and thrived. With regret, he embarked on the road back to the capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summer of the standard calendar 1647 is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, the Dresdner Regent was like a person, and quickly stabilized the political situation with what could be called "brutal." At the request of the Government of the Southern Republic, hundreds of heads were hung on the top of the Supreme Magic Tower, "repaying war crimes" and "responsible for failure in the South." All the main warring factions and the opposition kings of the Regent did not escape the cleansing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a long-lasting peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 17 years, in a late summer night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person called the year 1664, and the mark on the book of destiny is "yearchen". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twenty-five-year-old Emperor Gustav, as usual, handles government affairs in his own study and listens to his reports. His Royal Highness Regency had returned his power to him five years ago, and he served as the Prime Minister of the Empire, governing the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, any situation of power distribution will not last forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"", when the Prime Minister Dirstein and our Minister of Security held a banquet in the villa on the outskirts of DeLand at the Duke of Soma, the accidental fire was taken away. The life of dozens of people. This is really regrettable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man with a gloomy face and a gloomy gaze reported to the emperor. Although his wording used "regret", there was no regret in the tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way." Gustav, who has become a young man, nodded and had no sad look on his face. "So from today, Sid Nashua, you are my security minister. You are the first non-aristocratic security minister in the history of the empire, congratulations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s all the grace of His Majesty.” The man named Sid, cid nasec, replied that there was still no joy in his face. “In addition, in today’s accident, the Duke of Soma was completely ruined. He and his two sons and one daughter died in the fire. How to deal with this matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way...in the absence of immediate family members In the case, you should go to a neighboring relative. The farther the better, the better it is not related to any forces. Be sure to find it, it doesn’t matter if you spend more time, you can get from foreign countries or borders. It’s better to find a sideline in the area.” Gustav pointed out, “The younger the easier it is to be a good young man.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, I must do it. Of course, I will never fake it to prevent problems from being found by the vassals of the Soma Principality."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
