			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joint command of the Empire and the Superintendent is located outside the range of most of the magical and light medium-sized artillery. The command is a temporary wooden house built in the middle of the road leading to Gistov. On the left side of the commander's department is the iron cross diagonal cross flag, and on the right is the green cross flag of the government government. The tables and chairs inside are also divided into two sides, which are not in violation of each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Warriors have sent a group of new forces! The offensive forces have suffered heavy losses and cannot continue to attack!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Reorganize the team, within 15 minutes, the third group of the right wing is responsible for organizing the next attack!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinica leans against the headquarters tent Inside the corner, leisurely watching the noisy staff officers. The aristocratic officers of the Imperial Volunteers and the young and ardent staff of the government government kept proposing plans, arguing, and citing the classics, and finally reached one and another reluctant compromise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tactics of the empire built on the basis of "offensive" and "breakthrough" are so out of place with the Freedom Army tactics that emphasize "firepower" and "defense", even if Just a company's actions will also cause differences. The empire's staff always tried to pile up as many troops as possible in a small area, and the staff of the government government emphasized that the length of the front should be increased as much as possible in the case of overlapping fires between the two sides. Who can not convince anyone? . When someone came to consult her as the highest commander, "Marshal Govard", she didn't know much about these things. She always smiled and slumbered. It didn't mean that she did not say no, but let them think more. Her behavior has well buffered the tension in the command, and everyone sees that Govar is still calm and will feel that his impatience is very ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, no one knows that she did this just to avoid the attention of the Security Minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid; Nasser also watched the work of the military corps in the tent, and from time to time made some suggestions as "the advisor colonel officer." Somehow, he lost a right hand; no one can recover this hand for him because the only high-ranking pastor, Jeter, has died. Immediately after the arrival of the Security Minister, he took over all aspects of the actual operations, and began to implement the plan to withdraw to the west. The attack on the remnants of the trenches in the original camp lasted for two days, and the Central Army striker who was coming here was also ambushed. These actions succeeded in letting the central army in Voltkagrad think that they would rely on Kengal to resist, wasting an extra day and a half to gather the troops scattered on the central plateau. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything looks very smooth until the early morning retreat plan begins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major General Eugen, who has been working very hard, suddenly led the soldiers of the two temples to leave the team to retreat to the west and liberated about half of the prisoners of war to join him. Team. The force he took was too large, so large that if he allowed his actions, the entire army would be destroyed. When I heard this news, Rasta and Itis, who actually mastered the team, fell off the water in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That guy...Is it too small to look at him? Before the main force of the Central Army arrives tomorrow, destroy him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Finally his purpose is like this... speed up the retreat, after the emperor's palace, before Hull catches up, he will withdraw to Gistof!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opinions of the two have caused differences. In the end, Sid made the decision to defeat the rebel forces of Eugen here, so that there is now the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sixth offensive begins! Put into the eight empire companies of the reserve team, fight against their lack of the left wing of the new force, and break through the river! Once it breaks through, Drive them down the hill!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ninja listened to the final plan and bored the medals on his chest. In fact, she knew Eugen's thoughts a few days ago, but she didn't tell anyone. She is not entirely convinced of the imperial people who are currently fighting with her - especially the security minister and his agents. At any time, she will keep enough secrets to keep her safe, such as this thing, such as her easy magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood up and stretched out. "I went to the front line to look at it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The front line? You have to be careful, there are more powerful enemies there."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid glared at her, and this made her feel a little empty. After laughing and coping, she hurried out of the repressed headquarters and took her guards to the front. Several riders passed by her, rushed to inform the command to launch the attack, together with the casters wearing long and short robes. "Gowar" should not go to the left wing of the emperor, so she went to the right wing that had just been repelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the girl, there are seven or eight hundred soldiers injured in the morning battle, including a school official and more than ten eunuchs; the body wrapped in a white cloth sheet is neatly placed behind the line of defense and waiting for the rear, like a heavy wall. . It was only by instinctive acting that she did not collapse before this scene - Radz; the body that Govar had seen in her life should be more than the living person she had seen in her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Marshal, can you tell us a few words?" The third regiment, who had just lost one-third of the subordinates, requested. Renee can't refuse. She nodded, and the guards immediately ran to the highest flagpole nearby, raising the handsome flag of the government. The soldiers gathered and looked at her standing under the flagpole with numb eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Next, we invite Lord Margaret to speak!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a real pull Detz; Gowar, what would you say on this occasion? She didn't know, so she could only tell her own truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw your morning battle. You are a heroic warrior, you have always been. The morning battle is not because you are not brave enough, just because of the enemy and You are as heroic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the soldiers were numb, they were all dusty and not heroic. Their expressions seem to ask her, why do we repeatedly charge here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to talk about the meaning of this battle, and I don't want to talk about the frustrations of the morning. I can't care if the traitors can be killed. These things are right. It doesn't make sense for you to fight blood here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn't want to win--that means the people she knows will die. She also does not want to fail - that means she will fall into the enemy. Even if the opponent in front of him is completely eliminated, the war will not end here. The retreat is still to be retired, and the pursuit is still to be pursued, there will be no change. She only hopes to stop this battle as soon as possible, regardless of whether she is fighting for the soldiers in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to say one thing to you: Live. Live with your comrades around you. I will let the equipment department take out all the treatments." The potion and the reel are all used here. The equipment can be remade, and there is only one life for you. I don't want to see more bloodshed anymore. I hope all of us can spend the weekend in Gistov. "She waved her hand tiredly and called the logistics officer." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To her surprise, the crowd cheered. The excited eunuchs retelled this short speech and conveyed it to every company on the right wing. Because the other side received reinforcements and the low morale rose again, the soldiers who received the healing potions were again filled with courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live Marshal Gowar!" "Down with the traitor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These cheers on the hillside In Sorelton and Eugen, it is like a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dust from the shells is mixed with the smoke from the wizards, obscuring the commanders’ eyes. At least, the situation along the river has not been seen from the position of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eugen has already rushed past the final reserve team, but the offensive against the opponent is only a drop in the bucket. This force can only make up three groups, and the equipment and firepower are far from enough to prepare the level. After a morning of fighting, no more than two-thirds of the guns could be fired, but there was no time for the gunmen to repair them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lieutenant, the enemy is coming up. The position along the river has fallen, and the position at the foot of the mountain has been unable to hold back. They have asked us to make up these new forces." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auxiliary Annie trotting over to report. The goalkeeper turned his eyes to the hillside beyond 100 meters. There was also a strange color of fog, which declared the result of the previous battle. He picked up a rifle with a bayonet from the position and fired a shot in the sky to make sure that the last sacrificed master had not loaded two bullets and reloaded it on his shoulder. He suddenly noticed that his adjutant's blonde hair was still exposed to the wind without any protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your helmet, Anne?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah. I don't think I need to, So I didn't bring it out.” Anne grabbed her head and didn't say the real reason: wearing a helmet in the early spring was really cold and stuffy. The magic she possessed was enough to handle most of the pistol and ordinary rifle bombs after two hundred and fifty years, and she was not afraid of the lead particles of this era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie pushed up this big helmet and put her eyes out: "What are you doing, Soledon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing. Just me I feel that wearing a helmet is cold and stuffy this season, you wear it for me." The doorkeeper looked away and looked down the mountain. The governor’s army at the foot of the mountain organized a unit of nearly 2,000 people to make a smash. "This time the other side is coming. You look at Eugen and see if there is any reserve team that can be pulled over, okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne naturally understands His actual intentions, a respectful ceremony: "Understood, I will try to mobilize the troops."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be sure to pull some reinforcements. I can't find it here. Go to our camp. If you can't find the reinforcements, you don't have to come back." Naimen ordered coldly and pointed to the hillside behind him. "This is the order, let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that he had to pretend to be a business official, Annie resisted laughing and turned away. "He and that person probably still have something in common: they are all unfair guys. However, it seems that I am not qualified to say him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl slammed the magic of the door. The purple light representing the magic of protection is fleeting, and the juvenile is not aware of it. All his spirits are placed in the battle before him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morale of the overlord government forces sheltered by the mountains and ate the fortifications of the defenders little by little. Although the soldiers of the warriors are a new force, they lack training and have no will to fight. They often turn to the chest wall after a short battle, and even the assault company can barely fight with the other company's ordinary company. The door is the commander of the lieutenant, and he can only follow the team and withdraw, but he will become a prisoner after a slow step. Several times he was almost hit by a stray bullet, but somehow, these bullets were always past him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty minutes later, he and his team retreated to the ridge, this is the last line of defense. Almost all of the artillery that had been placed on the ridge had been destroyed. The only remaining two guns were withdrawn to the ridgeline and were being towed in the direction of Kengal City. Almost all of the flags have disappeared, leaving only the last three dough flags on the ridge to flutter in the breeze of saltpete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you hold on, everyone? The other party is also the end of the strong, as long as we support our reinforcements will come!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eugen’s smile on his face is very stubborn, and he still tries to make a look that “the situation is not so urgent”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The end of the strong...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no smile on the face of the door, from the mountain The shouting sound from his feet was shaking his eardrum. The black-pressed infantry line was divided into six rows in turn, and the rainy projectiles alternated under the cover of the magician. This time, the other side almost invested in all the reserve teams. The officers and men of the defending army were killed and injured more than half, and the doormen were surprised how they got alive and come here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, Anne has left. The woman is in trouble here, can't be captured." He slammed the bullet and used the baton to shoot the gun. I am thinking about the gunpowder inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorlayton, I am back." The voice sounded behind his back in time, almost letting him swallow the lead in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Separent Sefer! I am not letting you go to the reinforcements? Why are you still here?" The doorman waved anxiously. "You will not go again." The last line of defense will also be lost! The front team will surrender in a row, and then go on like this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have found reinforcements, so It’s coming back.” Annie climbed up the chest-high bulletproof wall, stood at the highest position in the whole mountain, and pointed her finger to the distance. “It seems that this war is not so easy to win.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Too dangerous, come down!" Resist the door to see her reinforcements, rushing to the chest wall to grab her ankle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter. Their guns are impossible to hit at this distance. Listen, that sound." The blonde girl seems to have something flashing in her eyes. "They are finally here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lieutenant looked in the direction of her finger from the top of the mountain in the opposite direction. In the distance is a red line, which appears at the end of the road along with the smoke from the horseshoe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the reinforcements really arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step. tread. tread. tread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people fixed their eyes on the approaching cavalry, holding their breath, no longer firing, just filling the bullets nervously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stepping. Stepping on. Stepping on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,500 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hooves are getting clearer and clearer, and even the cornerstone on the ramp is not shaking. I don't know who is the first to see the banner of the coming, cheering. The cheers of both sides are completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Interrex! is the second division!" The joy of the defenders comes from the bottom of the heart,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Red Devil! Is the Red Devil!" and the veteran veterans of the Koman Army have changed their looks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flag on the horizon is called "Chihai", which is a blue-blue wavy line on a reddish background. The number of the troops is the 2nd 'entlave' division of the Free Army. The combat strength of the whole army is second to none, with strong soldiers piled up in equal weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge military expenses of the Republic of Intres are all supplied to this division. If it is purely firepower and equipment, this division is the best equipped in the world. The troops are even better than the first "Republic" division known for its elite. This 18,000-person division needs the same number of people to maintain supply; there are more than 40,000 horses, and each soldier has more than two horses. All the soldiers can become cavalry when necessary - this is a luxury that other units cannot imagine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a long-time battle of Fawsall; the Viscount Rasta and his imperial advisory group miscalculated the reason why the division arrived at the battlefield time. The entire empire/superior government coalition command was tangled up and ordered to retreat. The contrast of forces is reversed, and everyone knows what it means. Rasta personally took the sword, and the horse patrolled the second-line company and shouted a few words like crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be prepared at all times!" "Accept the retired first-line troops!" "Supporting the past is a victory!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sabre "honor" exudes strange light, I don't know which special effect is working. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stepping...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One kilometer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hoof has been integrated into a group, like a storm that has swept across. The number is difficult to figure out at first glance, but at least there are two or three groups of forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her; Lieutenant Colonel Tedwood rushed to the front of the division, next to him was Bruto in a red military dress; Luther . Seeing this scene, Anne understands why Hull will come so fast and so skillfully. For this moment, the second division even let his forwards be defeated. This is a game of mutual speculation, whoever wins the last hand can win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No... even without this reason, should Hull also come to earn this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flag of the emperor ** was withdrawn, and the company was retired, lest they encounter the first round of attack by the Intercontinent. The Imperial Volunteers who are responsible for engineering magic nervously set up the barriers and turned from an attacking situation to a defensive posture. The pastor support team, which was still maintaining the offensive, stopped working and prepared to save the power to treat the casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assault! assault! Attack again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the first group was the real cavalry regiment. They did not use the maneuver to shoot, but did not hesitate to rush into the center of the enemy’s queue. The follow-up two other infantry regiments dismounted, arrayed, and filled bullets, clearing the enemies in the fortifications. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government government that has already attacked the hillside has once again collapsed, and the "Qinghe" flag still standing on the field is becoming less and less. If it is in an epic or knight novel, the outcome of the battle should be decided at the moment -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
