There is nothing that a Musketeer is controlled by magic. As for the young teenagers who use magic to control ignorance and lie, although they are theoretically illegal, they are done in every corner of the civilized world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as those who are clever and eloquent describe some anti-social or non-mainstream remarks that sound reasonable, or tell some horrible tears The beautiful story of the young girls will be unquestioned and become a loyal dog or slave of the magic users. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but if you have become a magician or pastor, a real spell user...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Don't let people know about this. Even if the mental control magic has been lifted, don't let people know about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The root of magic is that "belief determines power." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, only magicians in special situations, such as dead, weak beliefs or broken people, will be forcibly controlled by spiritual magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general mage, even if it is controlled, will quickly use his willpower to get rid of control, this time usually should not exceed ten minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being controlled is a shameful thing, being influenced by others, feelings can’t be said, implanting deep commands...for any confident magic As the teacher said, it is a shameful shame to be implanted in the deep command of the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenmen? Captain Solerton is now such a person with a belief collapse, a magician with no future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked east along the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been a new day, but no one has found it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of Lonnie’s clock towers are no longer ringing, and all the ringers are either escaping or fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire street, the entire block, the entire city is burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citizens panicked to the southern district where they had not fallen. Some people used wooden boards to seal the door and prayed to the gods. They wanted to wait until the next day. Look at the situation and make a decision later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More houses are long gone, and most of their owners have escaped to the safer south of Imiya, or the Isle of Wight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The East Third District in the east ignited a fire. It was a very important neighborhood for him, but he just stopped looking at the fire there and thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you waiting for? It seems that the third wall is about to break, and the main force of the emperor has entered the inner city. Go and surrender. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ear of the door, he sounded his own voice, using his own thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the deepest mental control, the subject will feel that he has the necessary and passion to complete the commands that are implanted in his mind. All mental control magic uses its master's knowledge, reason and logic to destroy his will and belief with his master's own thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left the road, walked into the path, and continued to the east along the path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you go east, the more Free Army soldiers you meet. Most people wore the variegated military uniforms of the National Army, and occasionally there were several people who wore military uniforms but did not carry military ranks and military caps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Defect! Total defeat! All the walls in the east have been compromised!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The headquarters has already issued an order, and all the formed units have withdrawn from the Mt. Bisie River!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The order at headquarters is that all troops are stuck on the barricade, The joint parliament and the military are evacuating to fight for time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't talk nonsense! Even if the United Council collapses, it will not leave Lenny!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people are spreading rumors, all of them are running out of their lives. Only the door-to-door? Soledon was a blue-faced man, and he bit his lower lip and went all the way to the east. Only this pain can remind him that he still has the opportunity to overcome spiritual control and not completely lose himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The field of vision is iridescent, as if the chapter of excellence is still working. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When is it started again? Did he not close before? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To turn it off. You can't wear a badge of excellence to be humiliated in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen also knows that the winner of a medal of excellence has never been captured, let alone surrender. This is the purpose of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bit hard off a piece of lower lip, and the blood ran down from the corner of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even with such pain, you can’t get back control of your body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he understands that a large part of the emperor said is correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I concentrated all the reserve forces together. It was my desperate attempt to create a miracle, but the result was swept away. I underestimated Emperor; this is my fault."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this world, faith determines power. People who are not assertive enough are nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am too used to taking risks, I am too contemptuous of the enemy. I rely too much on opportunism."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And he has no faith. He doesn't know what he wants. He can't even use three pieces of magic, his beliefs and strength are not worth mentioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always knows this. And he always felt that this can make up for it, and it does not need such a powerful force to achieve his ideals. What is wrong with opportunistic? What is wrong with relying on the strategy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me this is a dream. Tell me that everything I have done before has not happened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But now the door-to-door? Soledon knows that he has no cards in his hands. And it is not a card error, but a mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one has ever pointed out the facts in front of him like the emperor, and smashed it all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The random strains that brought him status and honor before, are not worth mentioning in the face of cruel facts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I love my hometown. Here is my hometown, my country, my dream city."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Suspend. You have not even vowed to fight for this flag. You have not officially joined the army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devil The whispers are repeated, thus controlling the thinking and nerves of the door. He couldn't stop and couldn't turn around. Not at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have been captured. Everyone has seen it. It is useless to do it again. All your efforts just speed up the city. The speed of the fall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forget it. This is the end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While not seeing him, he can speculate that the third wall was attacked by the emperor from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the city of freedom that is difficult to attack, the last day of Lenny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a city that has never fallen in such a long war, Lenny will eventually fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind has blown up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of a free country is coming to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all his fault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will also pay for this error. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will witness all of this and voluntarily enter the imperial prison camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenmen? Soledon will be the first in the history of the Freedom Army in the past, and I am afraid that it will be the last outstanding chapter of the initiative to surrender. The person is in the history books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would rather die in his own glory than to be humiliated--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the hand I have been stuck in the gun, I can’t pull it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But then you can get the full trust of the empire. Right? Right?" The demonic voice repeatedly emphasized, "There will be no more." Good loyalty is proved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he has no room for action. That command is so ingrained that it completely penetrates his mind, nerves and consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that's the case, it's fine. That way, as long as you pull off the chapter of excellence on the chest, everything is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I have another chance..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His life is everywhere The factors of regret. It seems that no matter where you make different choices, there will be different paths of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe he can get citizenship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe he can open a magical store with a good business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe one day he will have his own Master Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe he will eventually become the prime minister of the Holy Coman Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows. It doesn't seem that he can be decided by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Upper! Upload! Solerton Captain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems like someone is calling his name But he has no time to take care of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is just against the fleeing squad, silently heading toward the East Third District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he heard the bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone is ringing the Bell of Liberty in the center of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One sound, two sounds, three sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he still can't look back, the command magic he received does not allow him to turn back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Bell of Liberty represents the final convening order. All citizens, soldiers, and parliamentarians should gather in the Bell of Liberty and fight to the last moment." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he doesn’t know how eye-catching he is in the middle of the defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East Three Walls have been compromised. More than 30,000 garrisons there are running, reorganizing, defeating, surrendering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is heading west and south, and only one doorman is heading east. Until now, he has not seen even an imperial person, but he knows that the Imperial soldiers will soon begin cruel pursuit and clean-up operations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenny, who is surrounded by barricades, fortifications and traps, should be impregnable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a strong city needs a defender with a strong will to defend. When the defenders of each section of the wall feel that they have been enemies, any fortifications and barricades are meaningless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a glorious history of the group flag thrown on the ground and trampled on, even those who served as the colonel of the National Army, Major Generals are fleeing, Tens of thousands of soldiers fled along the streets to the south of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this mess, only one person struggled slowly with slow pace and blood in the corner of his mouth, heading in the direction of the most violent gunshots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can there be such an idiot in the world? Let him ignore it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I think he has already answered us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Answer? Why didn't I hear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "He is saying," the superiors of the military academy licked their dry lips and seemed to have some difficulty breathing. "He is saying...Citizens, going back to the battlefield. He is saying, citizens, armed, Go to the front line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case...has he chosen to die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Probably it is. Because we have all escaped, so he chose to die alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The damn bastard. This gangster-like staff officer They don’t take their lives and other people’s lives! No wonder the frontline officers and soldiers hate the staff!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old mercenaries picked up the guns. Did not hesitate to take a step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the east. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute...what do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think if I am I have escaped here, and I have never hoped to earn back thirty gold pounds for bribery in this life. So I chose to go with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abominable. You The action is so fast, I have robbed my limelight. I am also thinking that in this life I will probably never have the chance to be the second class of envious people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone inserted a sentence at the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you both want to reorganize the troops? Count me one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man wears the lieutenant rank on the shoulder: "The senator of the colonel of the ministry and the congressman of the middle school ran to the inner city with a smog. I had to take my hand to come here to try my luck. Not much chilling, I am The tenth 'Lenny' freelancer's Lieutenant Lieutenant. Are you two?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ensign of seemingly superiors and the ensign of seemingly veteran oil Looking at it, I exchanged a sly look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top students spoke out their own belongings: "Hey, Lieutenant Garnier. The seventh 'Great Sword' National Guard is affiliated."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sparary Lieutenant. Ibid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just, we are not currently under the sword Command. Our direct command is that person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gagner is busy pointing to the person who is not far from the rushing army, adds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, we are now owned by the Lenni detachment of the Western Army... Yes, it is the first division. It is the first 'Republic' free division. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of Spanion replied: "The combat staff of the Western Army, the heroes of Steelburg and Lenny, the youngest 'excellence chapter' in history, Captain Nathan Solonton, our commander." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***-***-***-***-***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;August 9th, 16th, 6th (Mday+130), Lenny North District<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***-***-* **-***-***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the north of Lenny's city, there is a contiguous empire with a glimpse of the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, "Zeng" is the company's company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the peak, along with the auxiliary forces, there are more than 150,000 people stationed here. The Jena battle emptied the camp in half, and on this harvest night, the remaining half of the camp was empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole piece of land is like a group that has been stepped on by the elephants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally there is a lonely emperor rider, holding a torch from the vast darkness of the horse. Most of them rushed south, but occasionally one or two people went north to the Jena to report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this critical moment, it is difficult to find someone who is willing to be a pawn. Everyone is willing to go to the city of Lennie to compete for merit, rather than to be a commander of the Rush. The standard specifications of the two men and four horses have been reduced and reduced, and they have become one person and one horse. Even so, the person chosen was extremely dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when the commander saw a female officer on the side of the road wielding an emergency help signal with a torch in his hand, he couldn’t help but violate it. The regulations have slowed down the horse speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When approaching the woman’s body, the commander discovered that the military uniform under her empire’s cloak was a bit wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the gray cloak, it seems to be a red military uniform - and red means the Free Army. The yellow light of the torch shaded the color, and he did not see it before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is already late. A huge force hit him on the head and knocked him down. He hasn't even seen the enemy's spellcasting action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female officer in the red whistle whistle, put the torch into the ground, squat on the horse, and turned to the south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before fainting, there was only one memory left in the mind of the commander: the female officer seemed to have only one arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her smile is very beautiful, but her eyes seem to be full of despair. Although that despair hides behind the purple iris caused by the detection of magic, everyone can see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry. It's faster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne Sefer is tight The cloak, slamming the whip in the palm of his hand, ran to Lenny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By detecting the magical eye of the magic, she can see the magical flow of the city. In just a few hours, tens of thousands of magics were released in the city, creating a large number of wild magic zones and dangerous enchantments. In her current state, she can't see the situation there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A scene that should not have happened, has it happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1873 Before, no foreign team had captured Lenny. At least in her memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also clearly remembers the newspaper title she saw as a child. Almost every newspaper celebrates the Imperial Army's capture of the city that has not fallen for three hundred years. In her history, Nerman Hugh Coleman gradually climbed to the highest position in the fight with the free nations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a long and arduous journey. From DeLand to Lenny, time and space are crossed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if this is the end of the journey...if the free country will completely cease to exist...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When she entered Lennie through the fifth gate, the problem was not patrolled in her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s chaos that caught her eye. The whole city is immersed in chaos and cannot be extricated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenny is not the city she is impressed with. She passed through the gates of one hole after another, and mixed forward in the stragglers of the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything around seems to be saying: "You are late." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After crossing the fourth gate, gradually began to see the knights who rushed to the inner city. These cavalry held torches and shuttled between the ruins, gathering scattered emperors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne pulled the cloak and pretended to be one of them, passing through the narrow path between the ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every empire who survived knows that Lenny is a fortress city, with deadly fortifications and traps everywhere; people who don’t know, They are all dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there is only one way for them to cope with this situation: set fire to burn. Burn all the suspicious buildings and use the work magic to level all the traps. The war mage and the aristocratic knight with black burning oil did not hesitate to throw these combustion-supporting agents and burned one and another houses to ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The North Fourth and North Five Districts have long been burned to the left of the wreckage. Anne passed the "Blue Diamond" site and stopped to hang it. She knew that the entire "Blue Diamond" material had been sold out, and the funds obtained became the military expenses of his sister Bonnie to establish his own power in the Western General Army; the personnel were also under the auspices of Reza, through the Half Elf Liner. The fleet of De Kikawi was transported to the Intresas Island for reconstruction. After that trial, the half-elves that survived the death were upgraded, and his river fleet was now a peripheral merchant fleet of the Red Fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when she saw the signboard in the ashes, she couldn’t help but feel a bleak, and she was not happy because she had to take off the threatened assets in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The time of the scorpion is one, but the time is six. The fate always changes, always changes, always changes."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After surpassing the bustling times, there is only one wreck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the wings of the butterfly dance, the world changes, but it is in a worse direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another city gate. The third gate of the north wall has been completely blown up. The bricks used to fill the back are scattered throughout the street. I don’t know how to attack and defend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the inner city, the cavalry is getting less and less, but the bodies and burning flames are getting more and more, and it can be seen that the lack of organized free soldiers have Responsible for resisting by using barricades in twos and threes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie suppressed her feelings, took out the skills of the combat staff, and estimated the death and injury of the entire front: "Only one body has only more than 20 bodies. There will be no more than a thousand in the entire North Third District."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering that the Lenny is said to have 100,000 defenders, this can only explain the fact that the Free Army has Stop organized resistance. Without a firm guardian, no more barricades and traps would be useful. The entire base of the military officers has collapsed, and the militia must have fled their homes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her home was once in the North Third District. The striking mansion has also changed hands, and now it is burning. Anne didn't even stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also sold too clean, sister? When did you start to notice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie is in a row and it is no coincidence that all the assets of Lenny are sold out. She realized earlier than her sister that a powerful headwind called "History" is blowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a trick of fate, or a counterattack in history? I hope that place is fine. As long as that place is still there, I can save the situation!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quickly crossed the gates of the North Second District. Dressed in a red Intres military uniform, she appeared quite conspicuous in a gray-blue National Army uniform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of her overflow has begun to attract the attention of the Imperial Royal Security and Military Intelligence. The head of the Eagle Wing, who was in charge of the commanding unit, quickly received the news and ordered an increase in the number of magicians responsible for magic observations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, she arrived at her destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the Free Army General Command, Ring Fort. It stands in a circular three-story building in the second district of Lenni in the last two hundred years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Anne, as long as the building is still there, there is hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But waiting there, only despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brand that says "Supreme Command of the Free State United Defense Forces" has disappeared. The four-color cross flag that was hung on the top of the Emperor's bayonet was supposed to be hung on the spire of the headquarters of the Free Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ring Fort has become an "Arc Fortress". The complete circle was smashed by one-third of the engineering mage, and the remaining two-thirds were also covered with holes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air is floating in the air and the kind of burnt fragrance left behind; if an oriental person is present, he will feel that it smells like the Qingming Festival Graveyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stained all the documents... Did the chain of Fortunes fall?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie Double The knee was soft and fell off the horse. She still did not give up, quickly walked into the main entrance of the collapsed ring, kneel down, and search for traces on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that the coordinates are still being transmitted... I hope this is only a temporary retreat, not the final abandonment..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She found it. The string of coordinates written in cipher text, covered with a layer of strong acid, its owner seems to never come back. It is the total withdrawal order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that it is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have plans, strength, and money! We even have knowledge beyond this era! What went wrong?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we were frightened by the changes in history, we fled to speculation and delusion to hide ourselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, we are no longer afraid of time and ruin, and we are determined to abandon all gentleness and want to be a new god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We thought that our understanding of history was the greatest advantage. We also thought about the ability to hide identity behind the scenes to manipulate history..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wings of the butterfly can set off a storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after the storm, even Taikoo Long could not destroy it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't keep history as it is. I can't manipulate history. The established destiny doesn't exist; the plot to manipulate the world doesn't work either."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If these two things can't be done, even if there is magic beyond the centuries of this era, what is the use? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History has escaped from destiny, and it does not control the hands of conspirators. It reacts to all factors in accordance with their own logic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s like...history itself is against us. Does it think we are a distracting factor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; When history itself is your enemy, all resistance seems so weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie subconsciously pressed the injured abdomen with her hand and retracted her hand like a touch of electricity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface of the substitute organs made from magic can feel the chills coming from the body. Each time you touch the crystal-like surface of the substitute organ, the brain creates an unbearable pain. If she is not a senior mage, she will be in a coma at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
