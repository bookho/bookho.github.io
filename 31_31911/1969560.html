The plans arranged on the New World have been defeated by the other side, and this time will succeed."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lord must not be allowed to step on the land. All those who can reconcile contradictions must die. Be sure to put the issue of the inheritance of the Duke of Soma on the table."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to lead a bonfire to the South by a cockroach? There will be no such thing as a good thing in the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "As the Eastern proverb says, even if a person is not guilty, as long as he carries expensive gems, he has sin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When Anne; Sefer was fighting on the deck, her sister was preparing lunch in the kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Bonnie began to learn to cook, the food on board has changed a lot, great, and ups and downs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza really still goes to the kitchen, but her interest has changed from "disturbing the work of the chefs" to "directing the slaves to cook." The most amazing thing is that even if the cooking process is carried out in full accordance with the instructions of the alchemist, as long as the spoon is Bonnie; Seifer, the food will always stay within the "good" range. From a certain point of view, it can be said that she saved the ship from the edge of the sailor rebellion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, even though her identity is a slave to the alchemist, no one has ever violated her in anything. The quiet girl who saved the stomach of everyone has become an idol on board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As usual, Bonnie was still wearing a sexy tight-fitting leather armor, standing next to the soup pot, stirring the soup for lunch today with a big tune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic ingredients of the soup are dried vegetables, which are also filled with salt, bacon, pepper and salted olives. The material is not complicated or rare, but the fire is well mastered. The aroma overflowed from the inside of the huge iron pot, which led to the movement of the index finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, so you can do it." She put down the spoon, wiped the sweat from her forehead, and removed some coal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the earliest ocean-going ships, they could not have caught fire. Fortunately, there is now a coal stove, which greatly reduces the mortality rate of navigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I arrived at Emerald Bay, the weather was hot..." The girl pulled the neckline and let the fresh air enter the gap of the clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, today's aroma is also great! With such a seasoning, you can make a good porridge. With this hand you can travel all over the world. Bonnie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie turned her head and found that she was the chef who followed the fragrance. The head chef is a 40-year-old man who claims to have been a chef for 20 years - Bonnie is cautious about this. In general, a chef with 20 years of experience should not fall to the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for complimenting." The brown-haired girl squinted and replied. She is always very respectful and low-key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your progress is amazing. To be honest, I really can't believe that the food was made by you a few days ago." The chef picked up a pot from the pot. Spoon soup, tasted it, and issued a "啧啧" praise. "With your current technology, if you are the daughter of a famous hotel in the metropolis, everyone will believe it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Smile, if I am The daughter of the hotel, then what about my sister?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh...justified. Anne, isn’t she?" The head chef looked around and assured. laugh it out. "So how did you develop such a good technology?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My sister can't cook at all, but eating is a first-class pick." Bonnie explained, "However, since we separated for a while, the technology was unfamiliar. It was hard to decide to go to the New World together, but it was a shipwreck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The girl snorted and replied: "Now is still a slave, how can you say that luck is good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really, I don’t know the sinister Miss. To be honest, your mistress is also a temperamental temper, a hard way to do things, and other aspects are still very good..." Speaking of this, the head chef couldn’t help but look around and make sure the alchemist is not nearby. Continue to talk. "... Of course, in terms of women, it is not a good woman; but in terms of the owner, it is a good master who cares for the short. If it is for the man to save, you can be miserable now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, even if it’s not Miss Resa, it’s the other soldiers on the ship who are the masters. Shouldn’t it be a problem? After all, they are all military.” Bonnie smiled and didn’t seem to think so. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing her ignorance of the world, the head chef continued: "Military? The soldiers are credible? The sailors and seamen on this ship, Most of them are gangsters. If there is a good way out, who wants to come to the navy? The navy is much more dangerous than the army, and the lower sailors have almost no chance of promotion. In the naval battle, the pension will not be given. Inside, there is no chance to see a woman... It’s a group of hungry wolves.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“That’s a bit too much, uncle? I think they They are very polite model soldiers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chef shook his head: "They are all rough people, just because you are there. It’s very polite. When you leave the boat, you know their true colors. There will be a lot of love letters waiting for you. These two literate guys have made crazy in these two days. Right, you recognize "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Recognize a few."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;"So, after reading the so-called love letters, you will definitely blush. But you don't have to care too much, it's just their reverie of the dream lover. The biggest dream of these young people is 娶A perfect girl who is as quiet, innocent, honest, and capable as you are... Of course, they are also very clear, it is just delusion, it will not be true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You really have a reputation... In fact, I am not so good." I don't know why, when I heard the comments of "Quiet, Innocent, Honest, Competent", Bonnie quietly lowered her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood up and walked to the side of the cauldron and found that the soup had begun to roll. "The soup is ready, can you open the meal? Do you need to send it to the dining room?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are right, don't stimulate those hunger Young people. Do you want to collect more love poems?” The chef pointed to several cast iron boxes that were already full of food on the table, which he brought with him early in the morning. "Or you have taken your sister and the owner's meal, and you don't have to be busy here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you. Then, Bonnie; Sefer retired. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl politely bowed and went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie walked slowly along the sidewalk on the side of the deck, as close as possible to the ship's side, letting the sailors who heard the lunch bells go to the collection Pass by yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bonnie, have you finished the meal?" Her sister heard her footsteps and poked her head out of Reza's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, today the dishes are slightly better. The chef is going to use all the stored food. Today, the main course's cured meat is about three times the usual." There are still some vegetables, and those radishes grown in the bottom compartment are finally willing to eat." Talking with her sister, gossip, Bonnie walked into the room with a lunch box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alchemist's room is a bit cleaner than usual - just a little bit, and it's still quite messy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the room is sitting at the table, illuminating the work table in front of him with a lighting magic. There is a lot of gold on the table, divided into many small pieces scattered. With a magnifying glass on her left eye and a tool made of dense silver in her hand, she carefully carved the alloys containing a lot of gold into delicate parts and gears; every time she finished, she poured some magic potion on it, giving They do case hardening. The biggest advantage of gold is that it is like tin, it can be processed with very simple tools; and the magic rate is very high, it can complete very complicated magic operations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I will be here. Although it will not be available in two days, you should still eat some."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, um." Lei Shake gave two voices as an answer, and did not know whether to agree or disagree. What is certain is that she is still fully immersed in her own research. Bonnie sighed and gently lowered the cast iron lunch box. On the table next to it was a few papers full of words. She picked it up and found it to be the structural design of the Goat's leg gun, and the data from previous tests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Designing this kind of thing under such conditions is so good..." She couldn't help but admire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, do you recognize the word?" The alchemist heard her admiration and asked. "Can you understand my design?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can barely read the books, and the family is also a businessman." Bonnie replied cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will keep the book?" Reza slammed her hand and turned her head. "Do you really remember?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will, will be a little..." The brown-haired girl was shocked and stuttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Great!" The alchemist opened the drawer and took out a black box. "I have been looking for an accountant for a long time! Then, these things will be handed over to you, Bonnie! Trouble helps me figure it out, all settled!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I haven't remembered it for a long time, I don't have much confidence..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, I believe in your ability!" Reza's tone did not allow her to refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie smiled helplessly and opened the box that was not too big but very heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The box is divided into four compartments, three of which are filled with gold and white coins, and there are tens of thousands of less; the last one is full of paper. Filled with numbers, it looks like stocks, money orders and the like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a little scared by the amount of money, and she was there for a while, and she said: "This is too much. You just put these Gold coins and silver coins are all booked for me, are you not worried at all?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should I worry? We are already ourselves, aren't we? If you have Need, just take a little. If you don't need it, you won't take it, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Reza’s tone is still very dull, Bonnie still felt a sincere and warmth from this discourse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because you trust so much, I will go all out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opens the box again, Start checking the securities inside. She picked up one and wrote the words "This is the five-dollar gold mark of the Rams Brothers Bank, which is for three years, with an annual interest rate of eight percent." She opened another one, which is almost the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All, all are owed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So it is a headache. Someone keeps accounts, It’s much more convenient to calculate... This time I can all pay off.” The female alchemist’s expression was as cold as usual, with some sighs in her tone. Seeing these owes, she remembered her young age - though, not a long time ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master, have you mortgaged the entire Hermont family?" Looking at the owed, Bonnie couldn't help but swear. "The Hullmont family of that year should also be a great aristocrat of Soma."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My father is also a man who once worked as a royal alchemist. Cavendish; Baron deermont, but you should not have heard of it." But now... Reza shook her head. How much can be redeemed, even if it is. Those properties, at least, have been mortgaged twice. People can abandon the past, but they cannot abandon the debts left in the past. "When we get to Soma, I can show you the old site of the family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soma Principality...No problem?" When Ma went, Bonnie seemed to have some concerns. "Before we left the mainland, it seems that we heard that the situation in the Soma Principality is unstable..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie sneaked a slap in the face: According to what she saw and heard, she felt that as long as the woman was the master, the family would certainly go bankrupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I heard that it is almost impossible, and the successor problem has stumped the entire continent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Wait on the shore, if the old guy is really dead, let's celebrate... But, I told you that I am a Soma nobleman?" Reza suddenly remembered another question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? Didn’t you tell us when we first met each other?" Bonnie asked, his face with a strange expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it seems like this is true. It’s really old, the memory is not good..." Reza thought about it, it seems like this is the case, I picked up the parts and put them into work. "Take the box and take it away. Finish it and give it to me before landing. Can you do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the complicated calculations and unclear terms Almost all of them are overdue or profitable, and Bonnie feels that she seems to be fooled. Two days... my God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Bonnie; when she was busy calculating debts under a dim oil lamp, her sister was enjoying the splendidness of the ship’s highest point. Transparent sunshine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Kleon Emperor" is a three-masted cross-boat. As the name implies, it has three main masts, all of which are suspended from the front sail, the mainsail, and the rear sail. At the top of each main mast, there is a small platform for viewing - on the one hand, for the sake of hope, and on the other hand, for the convenience of maintaining high sails. However, there will only be one person on the watchtower who is on duty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s so comfortable... It’s best to do some exercise after eating.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grab A rigging was used as a safety rope. After a loop was made at the waist, Annie squatted on the low guardrail and overlooked the nearby sea. At this level, you can glimpse the coastline in the north, where the green land owned by the Saints Elf. The coastline of Emerald Bay stretches from west to east lazily, then slowly bends to the south, leaving a warm and humid climate zone on the west coast of the Old World. The damp sea breeze blows from here to the northwest, and joins the hot air from Interry, which moisturizes the entire South Sansen and the Republic of Armenia - also moisturizing her delicate skin and golden hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the faint southwest wind, she can see the sailboat drifting slowly. Unlike the solitary voyages of the endless oceans, ships and seabirds are often seen on the sea in Emerald Bay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little white sails are dotted in the blue-green waters, from time to time from the side of the big ship, there are some small sailboats and small ones suitable for offshore sailing. Sailing, but the vast majority are small sails with single or double sails. However, the blonde girl is not interested in these boats, and her purpose here is not for sightseeing or sightseeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, sleep here, finally no one can disturb! I really didn't expect to hide in the ropes and there are people to step on..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows, just as soon as you lie down, the wind suddenly changes. The angle at which the hull is tilted has changed a little bit - the tilt of this point has turned into a considerable sway at the top of the mast. She couldn't keep her balance and her body was slanting; she had a safety cable around her waist and she didn't fall off the top of the mast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne has a red face and knows that she still has no experience in sea life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Still it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows, she just got out of thinking The ship swayed violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咣,咣,咣,咣!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great noise reverberates around, boat The waters adjacent to the sea suddenly ignited three or four water columns - that is the spray caused by some solid liquid. Anne was shaken by the centrifugal force and pulled away from the mast. She clung to the life-saving rope and watched the sea below and the nearby sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ocean not far away, there are three boats. The three ships were all sailing boats, forming a very strange situation: one ship was parked, and the other two were half-sail, and the sails of the two ships were painted black. The ship that was parked was a relatively large three-story flat-bottomed sailboat with a blue-green vertical banner on the top. The other two were medium-sized sailboats with two masts, and the styles were very similar. More than ten doors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
